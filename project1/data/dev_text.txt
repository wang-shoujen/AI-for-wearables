I think that, uh, one, uh, advantage of having, uh, the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't, uh, convict someone who, uh, really shouldn't be convicted.|sv
Definitely.|aa
Um, and I think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps to ensure that.|sv
I guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Have you ever served on a jury before?|qy
Uh, I have twice.|na
Oh, okay.|bk
It was a pretty wild experience.|sv
Uh, what sorts of cases were they?|qw
They were just, you know, small time cases where, uh, trailers and banks were involved, you know.|sd
So were they criminal or civil?|qy
They were civil.|sd
They weren't --|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
What, uh, what was the verdict?|qw
Did the, did the jury have trouble reaching a decision?|qy
Uh, the jury, it was, uh, let me see, I think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- so it was, -|%
they, -|%
and, uh, the one changed his vote at the end.|sd
So did it become? -|qy
So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and then he changed his mind after they turned it in --|sd
Uh.|%
-- but it then became unanimous.|sd
Uh. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, right?|qy
You just needed a majority?|qy^d
Right.|aa
What was, what was the other case?|qw
That was also civil?|qy^d
The, the other case was just traffic,|sd
the, -|%
and, you know, it was seat belt law --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and it, it didn't even hardly --|sd
Oh, didn't really even count.|^2
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
I'm, I'm a college student|sd
so I haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- um, and, uh, I did get one summons actually at one point,|sd
but I declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though.|sv
Yeah, I mean, I, I really, I would like to, uh, to do at some point, um,|sd
but, I, I haven't.|sd
Uh, one, one thing that I, I think is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, I, I think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now,|sv
but I wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well.|sv
Especially sort of. -|%
I wouldn't think that it does --|sv
How, wha-, -|%
it didn't, you know, it didn't turn out the way I planned it, I mean, the way that I would think that it would go.|sd
Uh, you thought it turned out pretty well?|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
but it was, you know, it was, -|%
jury was unorganized|sv
and it was, it was just wasn't organized enough for me.|sd
Yeah.|b
I'm not used to it not being organized,|sd
and I just assumed that it would have been.|sd
Oh, so it was just kind of a zoo|bf
and the jurors just sort of, -|bf
someone had to figure out what was going on?|qy^d
That's about what it was.|aa
Um. That's interesting.|sv
Did it, did it work out pretty well in the end?|qy
I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial|qy
or, -|%
Yeah,|ny
they, well they picked one person,|sd
and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have.|sd
So it work-, it did end up working out pretty well?|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
it ended up working all right.|sd
The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like pro-, product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes -- -|sv
Yes.|b
-- you know, it's not just a matter of, um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy,|sd
and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract,|sd
it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues,|sv
and I wonder if, uh, if there's really, um, if the system works adequately in, in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion.|sv
I, I don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really know what's going on.|sv
In, in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind.|sd
So. -|%
Yeah,|b
the, the bank was suing them for, uh, because they went to get the, the trailer --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh.|%
It was on his property.|sd
Oh, so the deal was that he had, uh, borrowed money from the bank to buy it,|bf
and --|bf
Right.|aa
So they came to get it.|sd
Yeah.|b
And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property|sd
and he wouldn't let them take it off.|sd
Uh, so they were suing to get it back.|bf
So, and they are, it was a double wide,|sd
so they'd already taken it apart.|sd
Uh.|%
So they left it there --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it.|sd
Uh.|%
So they were suing him for the money,|sd
and, you know, there's no way they could because it, it was the moving company,|sd
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Well why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you, -|ad
Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an, uh, nursing home now?|qy
Yes,|ny
I do.|sd
Do you?|bh
I have a grandmother.|sd
She's a hundred and two.|sd
Oh my gosh.|ba
She'll be a hundred and three in August.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we decide not to put her in a nursing home.|sd
She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town|sd
and then my sister takes care of her.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
She, even though she is a hundred and two, she still has all of her faculties.|sd
Right.|b
She still has her snap.|sd
She takes care of her own business.|sd
This is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker,|sd
but with somebody that needs around the clock care, -|sd
I have seen my family age.|sd
Right.|b
I have seen them in the, -|sd
she's been there ten years now.|sd
And I have seen them age twenty --|sd
Yeah.|b
I th-, I still think it is worth it if you, if you had a good nursing home|sv
and they needed some quality care,|sd
I would --|sd
Right.|b
My mother-in-law finally.|sd
They had to make a family decision.|sd
There's seven children in my husband's family|sd
and fortunately four of them live in the same home town|sd
and she has Alzheimer's.|sd
It was getting where she was getting th-, dangerous. I mean --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but they were very fortunate.|sv
It's a small town|sd
and she happens to room with one of the doctor's mothers|sd
and --|sd
Oh, well that's good.|ba
but she really doesn't.|sd
Nobody thought she would adjust,|sd
but she has adjusted beautifully.|sd
Oh, that is great.|ba
But then I am also facing my father who is very sick|sd
and my mother and father reside in Colorado.|sd
She's been taking care of him.|sd
I don't know how much longer this can last|sd
and at that point because he requires round the clock. -|sd
He can't do anything without her.|sd
He doesn't know when to take his medicine|sd
and it's really sad|sv
and I have thought if something would happen to my mother for, uh, -|sd
my brothers are not interested in helping me|sd
so I would have to move him down here.|sd
That way, -|%
I want to see the nursing home. If I have to put him into one.|sd
You know, where I can go see it.|sd
I, I'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado.|sd
And, -|%
Oh, why yeah.|b
I am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas.|sv
Yes.|aa
And some of them are limited care too where people can do, uh, -|sd
like they have apartment styles,|sd
but that wouldn't work for him.|sd
I think he is beyond that.|sv
Where if you need help you can get it,|sd
but basically people kind of have a small apartment|sd
and doctors are available if they need them.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, I --|sd
And allows, -|%
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Well, the only problem with these are that they are very expensive.|sv
Of course, I guess all nursing homes there is|sv
but, -|%
And the bad thing about it, before you can get any kind of government help, you just practically have, well you have to be a pauper.|sv
Right.|b
It, it takes every penny.|sv
They want you to spend every dime you have --|sv
Yeah.|b
Right.|b
And that's the sad part about it.|sv
Yeah.|b
I, uh, -|%
yeah,|%
and I think a lot of people who do it now. -|sv
In Colorado it's interesting.|sv
I talked to my mother.|sd
They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home.|sd
And my mother could make it on that.|sd
What she probably would do is disburse the money to me|sd
and then I would send it back to her|sd
so that's what would happen.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think that's what most people do.|sv
You just have to give it, everything away.|sv
Yeah.|aa
It's unfortunate.|sv
I, I work at a brokerage firm|sd
and I have seen so many people that just have to gift, you know, their belongings --|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
It's frightening.|sv
And I guess, uh, I don't know how old you are.|sd
I'm forty-six.|sd
You know, we're the generation moving into this|sd
and I don't know how our kids are going to take care of us.|sd
I can't imagine.|ba
I'm twenty-nine.|sd
Yeah.|b
And everybody in my family has always had, -|sd
we don't have any children.|sd
Everybody that has, has them later in life.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, my, my mother and my father are in their late sixties.|sd
So, I mean, they're not --|sv
Right.|b
I also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise|sv
and he's still living at home|sd
and I don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are.|sd
Oh, I know.|b
And so, it's kind of, -|%
you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations,|sv
but it, something will have to change as more and more of us get older.|sv
Uh, luckily, if we could be like your grandmother, I, uh you know, I would love to live to a hundred and two if I were okay.|sd
But --|sd
It, -|%
but yeah.|b
Most people aren't.|sv
-- yeah,|aa
most aren't.|sv
That's the problem.|sv
And that's the bad thing.|sv
I would hate to have lived so long.|sd
She lived by herself.|sd
My grandfather passed away before I was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety, ninety-one.|sd
That's incredible.|ba
All right, have you lived in this area long?|qy
No,|nn
I've only been here a couple of years.|sd
Okay.|bk
Uh, but, uh, I've, I've noticed that, uh, this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it, it, it's, it's a lot warmer, a lot drier too, because usually about this time of year, this, you know, you see a little bit more rain.|sv
I mean by, by mid February, I mean, we start getting a lot of rain.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
well I remember last year, or the year before,|sd
But it, -|%
terrible ice storm, uh, around this time of the year.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, this year it's been so hot and, uh, sunny|sd
it, it's really quite, uh, quite amazing.|sv
Yeah,|b
unseasonable.|sv
I used to, my wife and I we used to live in San Antonio, couple years ago,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it was, it was I remember the first day of Spring,|sd
it was so much ice that came down, later on that afte-, that afternoon and evening,|sd
Um.|b
it was just, it was horrible.|sv
I was just talking to my son today,|sd
he's up in Boston,|sd
and it was twenty-nine there|sd
and it was, you know, in the seventies out here|sd
and,|%
Yeah.|b
he really wished he could be here, rather than there.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, um, I don't know|h
I, I guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather.|sd
Oh really.|bh
Um, I, I like it warmer,|sd
I mean I like it, you know, I like it warm|sd
but it doesn't really matter.|sd
I mean, I'd, I would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly|sd
but, uh, -|%
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
I have, you know, -|%
I, I, don-, -|%
I think it's really been delightful.|sv
I come, uh, I've spent most of my time in, in warm weather areas|sd
and, uh, uh, the ice and snow just doesn't, uh, hold any allure for me at all.|sd
Well I spent three years in Germany,|sd
so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway|sd
But I got used to it,|sd
it was really strange,|sv
I mean, when I, when, when, when we came to San Antonio it was just like, uh, you know, it just, just swelter|sd
and then we got used to it|sd
and then we went up to Dallas|sd
and it was just, -|%
it's, it's not, not that it's just hot or dry,|sv
it's just not very comfortable,|sv
it just, -|%
Her-, -|%
do you, you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas.|qy
Yeah,|ny
a little bit.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
You must, well, uh, -|%
it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it?|qy
Yeah,|ny
my wife and I, the last day we were in Florida, we, my visiting my, uh, my parents, and my brother and sister,|sd
we were, we were down there|sd
and, the last day, right before we left, we had to, I had to ride with my sister|sd
and the air conditioning went out on the car|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
and, we, you, you just get used to air conditioning all the time,|sv
Oh yes.|aa
and this, -|%
it was just, -|%
the humidity was like eighty plus, eighty percent plus|sd
and it was just killing us.|sd
Oh yeah,|b
it's terrible.|sv
Orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat.|sd
Yeah.|b
I mean, that's really bad.|sv
Yeah,|b
well, I mean, I, I, I guess I've been in some places, you know, where the weather was just so mild, you know, places like Monterey, California or,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
just, you know, so mild,|sv
and then you've been to such extremes like San Angelo, Texas where you just, where you walk outside and you sweat,|sd
you know you're sweating,|sv
Yeah.|b
you look down at your arm,|sd
but you see the water leaving your arm,|sd
it's so hot,|sd
Oh wow, uh.|ba
I know I, I tend to, I tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh it doesn't, -|%
some people say, uh, they, they like to watch the changing of the seasons|sd
but, uh, I'd rather, you know, like southern California, you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, it's kind of a luxury.|sv
I tend to agree|aa
but, I don't know,|h
I, I think, in, in some, in some respects it probably more tolerable.|sv
Yeah,|b
well I guess this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as some of the others we might have gotten.|sv
No,|aa
the other topics.|sd
I got one topic,|sd
they said talk about the Middle East situ-, well,|sd
I guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something, and think about what -|sv
my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye.|sd
We messed up the conversation, anyway.|sd
Well I mean I've had some pretty bad, I guess some pretty controversial topics|sv
so it's just like well that was my fault.|sd
But then the weather's like, -|sd
man, I mean, it gets pretty mundane,|sv
I mean you can only talk about, about the situation just so long.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I know,|aa
weather's just not all that inspiring.|sv
Okay,|%
well it's nice talking to you.|fc
Okay.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
pretty good,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
pretty good.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
So we're talking about drug testing in the work place, huh. *listen|qy
Drug testing in the work place.|b^m
Um. I've been tested a few times, just before pre-, drug employment.|sd
But that's about it.|sd
I've never had random drug testing.|sd
Yeah,|b
we have random drug testing at, in my business,|sd
but I've never been, uh, never had to do it.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
they started that about a year ago,|sd
and I think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,|sd
at least that's. -|%
Oh, they do with alcohol.|qy^d
Pardon?|br
They do it with alcohol?|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
they, they, they'll check for alcohol.|sd
Oh, I thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine.|sv
No,|ar
once, once you start doing that stuff, you sort of, you're sort of stuck into, uh, checking for the whole, the whole thing.|sd
Huh. That's interesting.|ba
Yeah,|b
it's a, -|%
What type of field of work are you in?|qw
I'm in the oil business.|sd
Oh, in the oil business.|b^m
Yeah.|aa
Okay,|bk
and you work in the office around.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
I work in the office,|sd
so, uh, it's pretty, pretty safe environment.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah|b
see, I work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
and we work around a lot of explosives.|sd
Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on.|sv
Yeah,|b
so that's, you know, -|%
I'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment I work in, you know, they're working with explosives,|sd
and so they could blow up the whole, -|sv
well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,|sd
but still, it can be dangerous.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
well, I, I, I agree.|aa
I think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff.|sv
Yeah.|b
You know,|%
if it's, -|%
as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know, -|sd
as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, I don't have that big a problem with it.|sd
Now do they fire them, or do they? -|qy
Well, see, this is it,|^h
this is where I start having my problems with my company.|sd
I work for a private company,|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
So, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos.|sv
Huh, that's. -|%
I think our policy is that, -|sv
all right, it's probably the same thing.|sv
I'm not really sure what the -|h
Yeah,|b
really,|b
it's one of those things that you read once,|sv
and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it|sv
That's right.|aa
But I know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,|sd
but I'm not sure if --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
our company's a little tougher on the second chance.|sd
I mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, I think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply.|sd
Uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits, -|qy
Well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody I work around is in an office environment|no
and, you know, it's not, -|%
I guess I ha-, haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, so I gue-, you know, I guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery,|sv
I mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, uh, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the A -s and B -s are going to be in|sv
and next week,|sd
You could time it just right.|sv
Yeah,|aa
right,|aa
right.|aa
I know one employee,|sd
I know, when I was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,|sd
and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.|sd
That'd be just as dangerous.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff.|sv
Huh. That's true.|aa
You know, I've, I've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Do they give any limits on alcohol,|qy
or is it? -|qrr
Uh, I don't remember, to tell you the truth.|no
I don't think they do.|sv
Um, well, they must,|sv
I mean, gee whiz.|ba
That just shows you how much I've been paying attention,|sd
because I, I really don't know.|sd
I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask|sd
Oh.|b
Well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far.|sv
Uh, there was a company in Houston that,|sd
they did, uh, an unannounced drug sweep of the, of their company --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- oh, it was, it was, it was an unannounced sweep of, of, -|sd
it was not only drugs, -|sd
Okay Karen.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
You-, you're first.|ad
Okay.|oo_co_cc
I was just going to say I think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. You know, not to get in, like in a dead end job.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And plus, for me, it's, uh, I mean like medical and you know, uh, benefits and dental.|sd
Okay.|b
They're also important.|sv
Yeah.|b
I guess one of the differences I see is, uh, working for a university, uh, there is room for advancement, but not so much so, our in, uh, quite a highly unionized environment --|sv
Um.|%
so there is a progressive path,|sd
but not being in the say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people --|sv
Um.|%
Are they like pretty much train for a specific job|qy
and that what I hired for and then I, just very little variation from that.|qy
Yeah,|ny
somewhat that,|sv
but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, uh, a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution,|sd
uh, it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh.|sv
But I agree, you know, the, uh, medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, uh, security aspect for long term employment, uh,|sv
Well, you know that's interesting though.|sv
Because I don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore.|sv
I use to think that, you know, after you work, -|sd
you mean security, job security?|qy
Job security,|sd
yes.|ny
Uh, that use to be I think a couple of years ago,|sv
but I don't know if it is so much anymore.|h
In fact, they, we just had a lay off in what November, I guess.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, it wasn't necessarily, -|%
I mean, you know, some people had been there a long time.|sd
Yeah,|b
we are seeing that here as well.|sd
Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, so I, I think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|aa
No doubt --|aa
But, -|%
-- yeah.|b
Yeah,|b^m
and institutionally, like here at the university, oh if there is a cut back, well gee, it's not where it necessarily where it's needed,|sv
it's where it's most expedient which,|sv
Expedient,|b^m
yeah|aa
that's exactly it.|aa
Yeah,|%
where the most dollar, where, where you know it cuts back the most.|bf
Oh.|b
Oh.|b
See, yeah.|b
So we, -|%
Yeah.|b
I think that's one of the things too.|sv
You get too many management people, you know.|sv
It's very easy.|sv
Yeah|b
and it's very easy for them to say, oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time.|sd
Well, those people aren't there anymore.|sd
Right.|aa
Because it's support people that are providing --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
but, -|%
so what else do you think is important?|qo
Well the, uh, -|%
that's maybe the majority of the importance, I guess.|sv
Yeah,|aa
because my perspective is from an institution,|sd
uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- but if you're in the corporate world, I think there is considerable motivation for I guess in-, innovation,|sv
although he, you know, the more complex your structure the, uh, less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, uh, I think there is, uh, it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, uh, things can happen much more quickly|sv
and so you can see the reward of the efforts.|sv
I think probably in a small, -|sv
yeah,|aa
I was going to say more, it's more personal for one thing.|sv
You probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere.|sv
Right.|b
Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, I think you're just a number, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
You end up being your own person --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, well then that's their problem|sv
and --|%
Uh-huh.|b
whereas yeah in a smaller, -|sv
I think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished, you know.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|aa
It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Hello, Lynn.|fp
Yes.|b
Okay.|b
Do you have any pets?|qy
Yes,|ny
I have a dog and cat now.|sd
Oh, what are their names?|qw
Tibby and Liberty.|sd
Which is the dog and which is the cat?|qw
Tibby is the dog|sd
and Liberty is the cat.|sd
Uh, wife and I, we have, we have two cats.|sd
Oh.|b
Uh, one's real nice,|sd
but the other one is a, well, -|sd
she's pretty wild.|sd
Oh Ours are pretty calm.|sd
Yeah,|b
are they, um, just house pets?|qy
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
that's, that's what ours are too.|sd
Yeah.|b
Our cat we got from the pound the day bef-, the night she was going to be put to sleep.|sd
So --|sd
Oh, really.|bh
Oh, well, that's a nice, nice story. Um.|sv
Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had?|qy
Sure,|na
sure.|na
I've had a skunk --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- I've had a Burmese python,|sd
I've had rats,|sd
I've had mice --|sd
Wow.|ba
-- uh, let's see,|^h
I've had gerbils,|sd
I have, I had a son, he's now gone from the home, that was an animal lover.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.|sd
Wow.|ba
Um, do the skunk, uh, was it kind of like a cat to have around the house?|qy
Yes --|ny
Yeah.|b
-- it was litter trained --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and we had it perfumed --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, it was very aggressive.|sd
Right.|b
But all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
and the skunk. -|b^m
And the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Um.|%
Nobody came near it when he was there.|sd
Oh.|b
Uh, I had, I had a dog one time,|sd
and, uh, he chased after a, after a skunk and got sprayed --|sd
Oh.|b
-- so we had to, we had to give him a tomato, tomato juice bath, and, uh, get him cleaned up,|sd
Yeah,|b
they um, ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them,|sd
but --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so, -|%
Right,|b
but I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to --|sv
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
why, I don't know,|sd
I, I think they're kind of nice to have,|sv
they're kind of, you know, just relaxing to, I don't know, to pet and to, -|sv
I don't know,|h
when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that, just kind of enjoyable to, you know, have like,|sv
I don't know,|h
something giving you some affection as well.|sv
Yeah,|b
I always said if I di-,|sd
What, what do you think?|qo
Oh, yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
That'd be the best way to be.|sv
Yeah.|b
Um, do you like big dogs or --|qy
Well --|sd
and he had dysplasia --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.|sd
Really.|b
So, when he died, we got a little one.|sd
Yeah.|b
But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old,|sd
and it just, you know, was almost cruel --|sv
Uh-huh --|b
-- almost cruel for him to, to walk.|^2
Yeah,|aa
he just, he couldn't get up,|sd
he couldn't walk,|sd
so, he was a hundred and twenty pounds,|sd
so it was a chore.|sd
Wow, yeah.|ba
So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if --|sd
Sure.|b
Yeah.|b
And then we've had three cats in our married life,|sd
and we've got a calico now.|sd
Yeah,|b
we've got a calico cat too.|sd
Do you?|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
she's the, she's the nice one.|sd
We, uh, we used to live in an apartment|sd
and like, our cats never went outside,|sd
but, um, the neighbors used to let their dogs out,|sd
and our neighbors were, I don't know, kind of slimy,|sd
and, uh, our cats wound up getting fleas, uh, from the apartment that we were in --|sd
Um.|%
-- so, we had to, we had to flea bath them|sd
and it was, uh, it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, don't even talk to me,|ba
I, when I was single --|sd
Yeah.|b
and my husband, then fianc3e, was to keep my cat,|sd
and he let her out,|sd
and my house was loaded with fleas,|sd
I mean, you walked in|sd
and your legs were just black.|sd
Really.|bh
And we had such a time, and never got the cat back.|sd
Really.|bh
Yeah,|ny
I found it, you know, in the street.|sd
Oh.|b
I was a social worker at the time, and found it, -|sd
Now is it Stacy?|qy
Angie.|sd
Angie,|b^m
I'm sorry.|fa
Okay.|bd
Well, now, so if you were going to have a dinner party, what would you make?|qw
Um, let's see,|^h
uh, I like seafood.|sd
Uh, let's see,|^h
uh, shrimp, steamed she-, uh, shellfish with maybe herbs.|sd
Uh, spicy lobster with lem-, linguini.|sd
That sounds good.|sv
Yeah.|b
Now what is, uh, what is, uh, the steamed shellfish you said?|br
Uh-huh.|ny
And what would that be like, a clam or, uh, -|qy
Right.|na
Okay.|bk
Yeah.|b
Uh, I think hors d'oeuvres are good, too.|sv
Uh, and that way, you can have a variety. Uh,|sd
So if you have a, a dinner party and you're going to serve, uh, seafood for supper, what type of, uh, hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal?|qw
Uh,|%
Like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or, -|qrr
Yeah,|b
fresh vegetables would be good|sv
or, uh, just, -|%
Probably not nachos and dip, huh?|qy
No.|nn
And would you, uh, would it be appropriate to, uh, drink with the, uh, prior, when you have the hors d'oeuvres?|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
Okay.|bk
And then when you serve the meal, what type of wine would you have with, uh, with the, with seafood?|qw
Oh, all these hard questions|^h
Uh, what, white wine?|qy
That would be my guess.|na
Yeah.|b
And,|sd
I'm not really a drinker,|sd
so I'm not, I don't know a lot about that.|sd
Something sweet?|qy^d
Oh, goodness.|ba
Uh, chocolate, something chocolate.|sd
Uh|%
You must like chocolate.|qy^d
Yes.|ny
Well, let's see.|^h
Usually when we have a dinner party, I always, I like to grill.|sd
Oh, you do?|qy^d
So, we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.|sd
One of our favorites is, uh, to take some, let's see Philadelphia cream cheese I think, is that what comes in --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese|sd
and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail.|sv
And then I like to barbecue, like steaks or pork chops.|sd
And then we have, uh, s-, oh, lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then, uh, I don't know what we usually have for dessert.|sd
Cake sometimes,|sd
but, uh, that's what we would do for a dinner party, I guess.|sd
That sounds good, too.|sv
But that's, I guess when you talk about dinner party, that's probably not, uh, that's more for like when friends come --|sv
Traditional --|sd
-- right?|^g
Traditional,|sd
yeah.|ny
Yeah.|b
I wouldn't be the big, uh, snotty kind.|sv
I just started,|sd
and I bought a Martha Stewart,|sd
I don't know if you've heard of her.|qy^d
Huh-uh.|nn
Her cookbook|sd
and she talks about catering and, uh, you know, goes into, goes into all that and the different types of, uh, uh, different types of parties, you know, different types of foods.|sd
Oh, well, do you work in a, uh, in a setting where you, uh, are in the food business?|qy
Um, my father owns a restaurant.|sd
Oh, in, uh,|qy
It's, it's just a, uh, c-, a cafe,|sd
so it's not really anything, you know, that I want to, -|sd
it's not the same|sd
Uh, it's in Lewisville.|sd
Okay,|bk
all right.|bk
So you graduated from which high school?|qw
Trinity.|sd
Trinity,|b^m
okay.|bk
And that's a public school or private?|qy
That's public.|sd
Huh, okay,|bk
I have to get to know this area a little better, I guess.|sd
Uh, well, is your father's cafe, uh, one that you could cater out of?|qy
No,|nn
uh-huh, *listen; mistranscription of 'uh-uh'?|nn
it's not.|sd
Um, and he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably.|qy^d
Uh.|%
Well, let's see,|^h
what else for catering. Uh,|^h
Let's see,|t1
what about Hawaiian luau.|qw
Oh, that would be good.|sv
Could have, uh, uh, fruits and, and pineapple, uh,|sd
let's see, uh,|^h
And you could actually go with, uh, a chicken if you wanted to.|sv
I think, I think decorating your food is, you know, really, -|sv
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
um, I guess we're going to talk, describe, uh, job benefits,|sd
and so what do you think, next to salary do you rank, is the most important job benefits?|qw
Uh, I would say the medical, uh, group insurance area --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well, um, does your company have good benefits in that, in that regard?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I think, -|%
I work for a public school system, district --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing,|sd
where the school district does, um, the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of, uh, costs.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
But overall, um, I've been pleased with it over the years.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year, our district has had to alter, uh, you know, change companies,|sv
or now we're on a managed care thing, which has stressed a lot of people out --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I see.|b
How about yourself?|qo
Uh, well I'm, -|%
my medical coverage is with an H M O --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- um, so, that's, in my opinion, that's get-, that's bordering on a health clinic,|sv
but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage.|sv
Right,|aa
yeah.|aa
Um.|%
Our district did that for the ninety-one and the ninety school year, or calendar years,|sd
and I was in the H M O,|sd
and, um, I was because my, my same doctor, you know, agreed to be in it for, uh, -|sd
they usually sign a contract or something --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, um, uh, I did have surgery last summer|sd
and I paid ten dollars when I went to see him that first day,|sd
and I've never seen another bill,|sd
so I --|sd
Right.|b
But, again, I was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it.|sd
Uh, if you've been going to a doctor for, you know, ten years or something and he elects not to join, it can be very stressful for --|sv
Yes.|aa
That's right,|aa
yeah,|%
I'm, I'm fairly young myself,|sd
I've only been, -|sd
when I first started working which, -|sd
three years ago is when I first got into full time employment --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, at that time I immediately joined the H M O,|sd
and I never really, -|%
so the only doctor I, I've kind of consistently had has been through the H M O,|sd
and, uh --|sd
Yeah.|b
Right,|b
but if you, you know, have a family and, and, um, everybody's gone to different doctors, uh, it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your, just has, you know, all the medical history|sv
and you feel comfortable with it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, I'm sure it would be very stressful|sv
and, my husband and I have just elected that if that happens, I will go and just pay.|sd
You can continue to go to your own doctor --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but your benefits are not as, you know, good,|sd
so, uh. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|%
um, like you, you mentioned you work for a school system.|sd
I work for, uh, Georgia Tech in the --|sd
Oh, all right.|b
and I guess another one that, that I rank up there high is the, uh, kind of job flexibility and time off, um, I enjoy as a benefit.|sv
I do too.|aa
Are you talking about like Spring Break|qy
and, -|%
Right --|na
Right.|b^m
-- yeah,|b
getting a lot of breaks --|bf
Right.|aa
It, it really, um, -|%
I don't think most of our teachers, -|sv
now I'm not a teacher,|h
I am a secretarial executive assistant,|sd
but I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all, all year long --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It is just, Texas has really, um, you know, -|sv
they want everybody educated, no matter what it costs,|sd
uh, and it, it would be just, -|%
we all look forward to, -|sv
like in two weeks we have Spring Break,|sd
and --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
What do you do there?|qw
Well, um, I'm not actually on the teaching faculty,|sd
but we have a large research organization associated with the university,|sd
and that's who I work with.|sd
Okay.|bk
Um, and we're given, you know, a good bit of flexibility in what we do.|sd
We can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study.|sd
Well, that's good.|ba
Yeah,|b
I would think that that type of employment, you're, you're, one day you might be really tuned in and the next day, oh, a little luke warm or something --|sv
Right.|aa
-- and, um, it's good that they allow you that.|sv
Right.|aa
It, um, -|%
as I say, the schools, -|sd
now we do have to work, you know, the day,|sd
but we do get many days off,|sd
and, uh, we all look forward to it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's the only reason I work there, is that my children now have graduated, and graduated from college|sd
but at the --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I've just continued to, uh, stay there|sd
Are there, are there any things that, that you'd like to see changed in terms of the, the benefits?|qy
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I guess it took, -|sv
so I guess the recording has started now.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh.|%
So, have you ever served on a jury?|qy
I served,|sd
I was in the Air Force, and served on a court martial, uh, board a couple of times, which is very similar to a jury.|sd
A lot of the same rules apply.|sd
Have you ever served on one?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I finally served on one last year.|sd
I've, um, been voting for years,|sd
and I couldn't figure out why I hadn't been called yet --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I finally was.|sd
So it was an interesting experience.|sv
I was kind of boring. *listen; should I be "it"|sv
Was it civil or criminal?|qy
Uh, it was, uh --|sd
A grand jury or, -|qrr
Uh-huh.|b
-- so it was a combination of, uh, -|sd
and I was in the pool for a couple of weeks --|sd
I see.|b
-- so it was a combination of criminal and civil,|sd
and they had, uh, -|sd
well most of the time we, we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then, it was always exciting when we got called to, to, to go, because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides, uh, just sit in the jury room.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, did, did the judge, uh, hand down sentences|qy
or did you folks do that?|qrr
Uh, yeah,|ny
the judge did.|sd
Uh, I, uh, I had a hard time getting seated on a jury.|sd
I kept getting, uh, -|sd
I'd be questioned, uh, for empaneling the jury,|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um.|%
Course they don't have to give a reason,|sd
but it's just --|sd
No.|aa
they want to get the best, uh, mix for their case,|sv
so --|sv
That --|sv
Yeah,|b
well I kept getting called up for drunk driving questions,|sd
and I think part of it was they didn't, uh, they didn't like the fact that I don't drink any more.|sv
So. -|%
Uh-huh,|b
I see.|b
Because you'd probably be, uh, too puritanical|bf
and -- -|%
Yeah,|aa
that was --|sv
although in my case I might have been more, uh, sympathetic with the person who got caught,|sv
I don't know.|h
Uh-huh.|b
So, uh, were, were the, uh, sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair,|qy
or would, -|qrr
if you were deciding, do you think that they would have been different.|qy
Well, I was never there, never there for any sentencing.|^h
Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, uh, on my next to the last day,|sd
and, uh, we got into the, uh, jury room to, uh, decide the case,|sd
and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, uh, not guilty,|sd
and he would never vote for guilty.|sd
Huh.|%
So, uh, they appointed me jury, jury foreman|sd
and I, uh, didn't think that, uh, going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict,|sv
so I told the judge that we weren't, were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate.|sd
Um.|%
So the whole thing had to be tried over again.|sd
Wow,|ba
I bet that made him happy.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
it was, uh, it was funny.|sv
The, uh, -|%
I ju-, I, I don't know,|h
I, uh, I didn't, uh, uh, I didn't like not being able to deliberate.|sd
Right.|b
I, uh, I, I wanted to vote guilty for the guy,|sd
and the other people were kind of mixed --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so, uh, the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again.|sd
Cost him a lot of money,|sv
I'm sure.|sv
Yeah.|b
Oh, how many members were on the jury?|qw
Was it a six or twelve member jury?|qy
Uh, it must have been six.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
That's kind of curious to me.|sd
I didn't realize until the, uh, Wayne Kennedy Smith trial, uh, a few months ago that they had six member juries.|sd
I thought that they, you know, it was always twelve, twelve men tried and true, so to speak.|sd
Um.|%
But, uh, apparently for some, some crimes, it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment.|sv
Um.|%
I know on a -|sd
getting to this unanimous thing, whether, you know, a jury should be unanimous or not, or not, in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous.|sd
It's a simple majority, you know, rules.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, let's --|h
is it on, uh, capital crimes that they have to be unanimous|qy
and, -|%
Probably on capital,|na
I don't know,|h
we weren't, we, we, -|%
the two that I were on had to do with drugs --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, we were, uh, unanimous is acquitting the person, even though we in our, in our, uh, gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends, because of various things,|sd
the government really failed to prove its case,|sd
and, you know, being fair to the person, if the government doesn't prove its case, no matter how you feel, you have to go by what's offered as proof,|sd
and we had to acquit him in both cases.|sd
Uh, it was too circumstantial?|qy^d
Uh, yeah,|ny
it was, yeah, in some of the critical things, like the off-, special investigations, at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person,|sd
but something happened to the camera and the tape and -- -|sd
Um.|%
-- all they could do was testify,|sd
So, the, the topic is hobbies|sd
In your spare time.|^2
Yeah.|b
Who has spare time|qh
Um, I don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that.|sd
I used to. I used to do, like salt ornaments and things.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But that was, oh, good many, many years ago|sd
and --|%
Yeah.|b
I usually go do aerobics and read,|sd
and that's,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
I understood that.|sd
I'm, you know, I work full time|sd
and I have two kids|sd
so my spare time usually involves something with the kids.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, hobbies, -|%
we, I, I can't really say that we have hobbies.|sd
It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.|sd
You know, we like to go out|sd
Yeah,|b
family.|%
Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we, we did that like as a family, little ornaments and,|sd
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
But --|%
Uh-huh.|b
I've just never been very skilled at,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good|sd
and, -|%
I, I guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, I've done, um, some needlepoint.|sd
I've done mostly cross stitching.|sd
I used to, uh, do like, um, -|sd
one that I did for both kids are like, oh, -|sd
they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals|sd
and then you have their birth date on them,|sd
Yeah.|b
and then you have a little picture of them|sd
and you frame them and stuff,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but nothing steady.|sd
Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it,|sd
but, you know, it's nothing that I,|sd
It's not,|bf
No.|aa
Not at all.|aa
Yeah.|b
I don't even know how to knit|sd
and my mother used to knit, you know,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, and I don't even know how to knit|sd
I'm like, that's a lost art from this family|sd
Yeah.|b
So, um, -|%
but, it's not a very good topic|sv
it feels like,|h
No.|aa
not when you're n-, -|%
neither one of us are really, -|sd
I, I have seen things I really like,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Needlepoint,|sd
Yeah.|b
But, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it,|sv
Yeah.|b
It's like, God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made|sv
I don't know what, what, is, -|sd
it's like there, -|sd
but here a lot of the country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff|sd
and there's just tons of stuff everywhere|sd
and,|sd
Yeah.|b
and then on weekends they go out and sell it|sd
and during the week they go back and do some more.|sd
And see, they do that as their job. Whereas,|bf
Right|aa
and they make it cheaper for us to buy|sd
Yeah|aa
Definitely.|aa
So, -|%
but, and, I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that|sv
because I can remember when I used to do, you know, those little salt, those figurines and things.|sd
It was, it was relaxing, you know, creative,|sv
you felt very creative.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, it just was so time, time,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
and, -|%
Okay|b
Well, I think, I think we're okay.|sv
I think we did five minutes,|sv
so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore|sd
Yeah.|b
So, -|%
Okay.|b
Well, thank you.|ft
Okay.|bd
I hope you have a good rest of your weekend.|sd
Thanks.|ft
Bye-bye.|fc
Okay.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Well, uh, I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in, in specific, uh, very specific in this, uh, very specific examples such as, uh, transportation workers, as in, uh, air traffic controllers, bus drivers and that kind of thing.|sv
Well. -|arp_nd
Um, I don't really think that it's, uh, too many,|sv
I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, well, we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, uh, you know, worthy of working for us.|sv
I really don't see that that's a very, very valid, uh, thing for a company to say,|sv
and I, personally, I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body.|sv
Yeah,|aa
uh, I guess I basically agree that, uh, -|sv
do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs?|qy
I mean suppose they found out some other way?|qy^d
Well, I think, I think we, I think the problem here is, is that a, a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs.|sv
Yeah.|b
There's too many cases where it can, you know, -|sv
there can be false positive results, and that, that sort of thing.|sv
I don't think there's any definitive, you know, -|sv
okay this person is taking drugs,|^q
so we don't want him here.|^q
Yeah.|b
Uh, like I said, some industries, though, I think it'd be very necessary,|sv
I wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when I'm flying in an airplane.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, I, I just, I find it to be pretty offensive that, that it's such a, a big deal.|sv
I mean, if your employer's not going to trust you|sd
or, you know, it, -|%
I just, I think it's a whole trust issue.|sv
I just can't see it.|sv
But, have you ever been in a situation where you, you were drug tested|qy
or, -|%
Uh, yeah,|ny
I have been.|sd
Yeah.|b
I.|sd
I once too,|sd
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
I mean it's very humiliating,|sv
and, I mean, I'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs,|sd
but I, uh, I am totally against that sort of a, uh, -|sv
I mean it's, it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says I want to look at your urine before I'm going to talk to you.|sv
Yeah.|b
I had it during a job interview,|sd
and I just thought it was dumb of the company, at a point where they were trying to convince me to, to want to work for them --|sv
Right.|b
and I'm just like, well, uh, I'm not even going to think much about it --|sd
Yeah.|b
Right.|b
Right.|b
That's, that's basically my opinion on it, right there, is that it's just, you know, -|sd
I did, I, I was in the same sort of situation as, -|sd
it was a job interview|sd
and then you had a physical, where you were drug tested,|sd
and it's, -|%
I just, -|%
and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not, you know, been hired by a corporation which, uh, you know, -|sd
I really. -|%
The other side of it is, is, besides its being an invasion of personal privacy, as in my, it's my bodily fluid|sv
and I don't really want you to look at it, or --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
just to the fact that I don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they're not at work.|sv
I mean, during the eight hours, during the day, when they're supposed to be there, I think they have every right to say this is, these behaviors are acceptable and these are not,|sv
but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work, I find that to be fairly offensive also.|sv
Yeah,|b
well like you say, I mean, if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt, then really what people ought to be doing, I mean, the, the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work --|sv
Right.|b
Right.|b
And, I mean, if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem, then they'll notice it for other reasons.|sv
That's exactly right.|aa
Yeah.|b
And also I just think it, it gets a lot, -|sv
I'm a big, uh, supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies,|sd
and I think that it just moves down along a line that, that I really would find bad if, if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work, you know,|sv
there's already talk of people, -|sd
well, we're not going to hire you if you smoke.|^q
Well, you know, I, I can see how they can say in the work place we, you don't want them to smoke,|sd
but when somebody leaves work, I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all.|sv
Well, do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this|qy
or, -|%
Uh, I really think it should be, except as I've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries --|na
Yeah.|b
And other than that I think, I do not think it should be allowable.|sv
I think it should be illegal for them to, to want to do that.|sv
It should, it's kind of the big brother syndrome,|sv
I mean, I just, -|%
anything like that just kind of scares me.|sd
I tend to, to view it, -|sd
even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that, I sort of want to defend an employer's rights as opposed to an in-, uh, in addition to an individual's rights,|sv
but an employer, really, I think, has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to --|sv
Right.|b
-- and if they say they don't want smokers, I sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that.|sv
Right.|b
Uh, and I don't really, -|%
Okay, Mary.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yes.|b
Um, the, uh, the latest one I've seen, uh, had to do with a, uh, uh, the, uh, basically a manhunt, um,|sd
and it was, uh, it was called MANHUNTER, actually.|sd
Uh, the, uh, the guy, uh, apparently had a, a, mental disfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people. Uh, just, uh, kill them with, with as much blood and, and guts as possible.|sd
Oh, how awful|ba
It was true, it was truly awful.|sv
It was not one that I picked,|sd
but, uh, uh, it, it did show some, some, uh, some interesting things about the F B I|sd
because they were the, the, uh, the characters trying, trying to get him were F B I people|sd
and, uh, uh, of the, of the few good things that were in it, it did show, uh, a lot about the F B I. About the training, and, and how they go through training and how they try to, to develop, uh, uh, a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that.|sd
And it was, uh, uh, it was pretty telling about the, the, the F B I and their procedures.|sd
I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.|sd
Yeah,|b
I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, uh, going, I guess.|sv
Yeah,|aa
well, they keep it rather secretive,|sv
yes|aa
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Well the most recent movie I saw, uh, I'm afraid was, uh, -|sd
well two, two of them actually.|sd
Uh, the RAIN MAN was one.|sd
Oh that was great one.|sv
Wasn't that fabulous,|aa
and,|sd
Oh, I loved it.|sd
You know, I haven't seen that one yet,|sd
and I need to go see it.|sv
Oh, you need to see that.|aa
Yeah.|b
That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and this all took place in the South.|sd
Oh my. -|ba
And, uh, normally never the twain shall meet.|sv
You bet, especially in the South.|aa
Yes,|aa
right,|aa
and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie.|sv
The acting was phenomenal.|sv
Well as, it, as I recall it got some Academy Awards, didn't it.|qy
Oh yes,|ny
Jessica Tandy won best actress|sd
and, uh, -|%
Oh yeah,|b
that's right.|sd
It, it might have one best picture, too.|sv
Yes|aa
it did,|sd
yes|aa
it did.|sd
Yeah.|b
Just as RAIN MAN, uh, with Dustin Hoffman,|sd
That was, -|%
yeah,|b
I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, uh, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,|sv
but, uh. -|%
Yes,|aa
uh, oh, that was, that was, uh, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman.|sd
Yeah,|b
it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff.|sv
Yeah|b
and a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati.|sd
Oh.|b
Is, is the Kmart there?|qy
Oh, we do have Kmart here,|na
you better believe it.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Isn't there a Kmart everywhere?|qy
That was, that was so funny,|sv
he had to, -|sd
or was it Kmart.|qy
Yes.|ny
He had to buy his underwear at Kmart.|sd
Right,|aa
right|aa
yeah.|aa
That was hilarious.|sv
The, the, I guess the, the first, the first, uh, scene in that movie that really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, uh, dropped the, the, uh, the toothpicks,|sd
Oh yes.|b
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.|sd
Yes,|b
yes.|b
Unbelievable.|sv
Well, you know there are people, uh, referred to as savants also,|sd
Yeah.|b
and everyone feels they are totally retarded.|sd
Yeah,|b
wel-, because that's the way they, they might seem outwardly,|sd
That's right.|aa
but, boy there's a lots going on in there|sv
It's amazing|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah|b
and I, the, the, I think the, the best thing about RAINMAN was the, uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease,|sv
Yes.|aa
an, and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, you know,|sv
and, and, and you need to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then ag-, then again work with it toward a good end.|sv
Yes|aa
and the, -|%
Right,|b
well the warmth that developed between them|sd
and again it, I think was a picture of relationships.|sv
Yeah.|b
Again the relationship, uh, between the two, uh, that, uh, never would have occurred, uh, by accident.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
I was, uh, I was so impressed with that movie|sd
I saw it three times.|sd
Did you.|bh
I can, I can se-, tell you, oh, so much about that movie, just because it, it really rang, uh, rang a lot of my, uh, my personal background.|sd
I, I have a, a brother myself that's, that's older|sd
and, uh, he's not, you know, -|sd
nothing, nothing, of course, serious is wrong with him|sd
but, uh, but we have gone through these, these lapses of, of a relationship,|sd
Yes.|b
and then, you know, uh, for, for, for no real, you know, direct reason, I guess, uh, we, we get into, uh, uh, a really good relationship for a while and then, you know, back and forth|sd
so I, I was really able to, to relate to the, the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers.|sd
That was neat.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well that's tremendous,|ba
that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family.|sv
Yeah,|aa
a lot.|sd
And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.|sd
Uh-huh.|aa
No question,|aa
he, the, he was, he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that.|sd
He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things.|sd
Uh-huh|b
And, and, uh, it, it was like pulling teeth to go get him to, to see it|sd
but, uh, oh boy. He was, uh, uh, he, he gave the, the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN.|sd
I mean he certainly didn't, -|sd
he only saw it one time,|sd
and he didn't go back for more,|sd
but, uh, he, he said he enjoyed it|sd
and, and, -|%
Well he at least saw it one time|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
and, and he really, -|%
I don't know,|h
he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway.|sd
But he wa-, but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this|sd
I'm like, oh, come on.|sd
Just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is.|^2
Yeah.|aa
He will do that, to research it and to be able to mimic a person, uh, uh, with the kinds of problems that he had.|sd
And to make it believable.|^2
Yes.|aa
I mean I was, I was believing it,|sd
I don't know about any body else|sd
but I was, it was great.|sv
Well, I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them.|sv
He did great.|sv
Well it's just, uh, been delightful talking with you.|fc
Yeah,|fc
yeah,|fc
you take care up there|fc
and, uh, let's hear it for the summertime.|fc
Absolutely,|fc
I'm ready for it,|fc
but they're predicting some more snow for our direction.|fc
No,|fc
oh no.|fc
Oh well, take care.|fc
Take care now.|fc
Bye, bye.|fc
Bye, bye.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I'm back on.|sd
Okay.|b
Um, you say you watch evenings mostly?|qy
I watch evenings because I work all day.|sd
I used to watch daytimes.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, mainly like ALL MY CHILDREN, that kind of thing.|sd
Oh, so ... -|%
And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE,|sd
but now it's mainly evenings.|sd
Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there?|qy
Yes.|ny
Which ones?|qw
I tape THIRTY SOMETHING,|sd
Oh.|b
Those are the two I like the best.|sd
Oh, two they're going to change.|sd
Well, one they're taking,|sd
I know.|sd
It's going to be history, I know.|sd
I don't know what's going to ha-, -|sd
yeah,|%
we like L A LAW.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We don't watch THIRTY SOMETHING,|sd
but that's kind of young for us.|sd
My husband and I are grandparents.|sd
Oh, well. Well ... -|%
So we don't watch, uh, that type of show,|sd
but we like L A LAW.|sd
We like,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We're just, -|%
I'm sorry they're breaking the team up, because we liked all the ones that were on there.|sd
I know.|aa
I'm amazed.|sv
I'm not sure I like the new ones too much.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
I'm surprised that, I was surprised at the ending of, you know, with all the funny things happening and different things.|sd
I just wonder if, if, uh, they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show, since it's gone on for so long,|sv
it looks like,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I know.|aa
Of course, I guess that's not bad.|sv
Alan Alda did it on MASH.|sd
I know.|aa
Isn't that funny?|qy
It hasn't hurt him at all.|sv
So do you, do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour?|qy
Oh, I don't usually like stuff that continues.|ng
That's why I'm surprised I like those two shows, because usually I like, you know, stuff that just ends sort of, that you just, you don't have to,|sd
In one hour, like QUANTUM LEAP.|^2
Yeah.|aa
I mean, you don't have to ... -|%
That's one of our favorites|sd
Yeah.|b
You don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow,|sd
so,|sd
Right,|aa
which they do at the beginning of the season,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
that's always a bummer too.|sv
I know.|aa
Sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
We, we do that sometimes.|sd
I, I guess I'm, I'm not into real heavy stuff.|sd
L A LAW is about the heaviest thing I watch.|sd
I,|sd
Yeah.|b
so I like things like GOLDEN GIRLS or CHEERS|sd
or, uh, Monday night is real good with me, you know, MAJOR DAD and, and, uh, NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, and, uh, -|sd
oh, what's that one with Burt Reynolds?|qy
That type of show is what we --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We generally just stay on one channel all, for all of Monday night, just to watch those.|sd
Just some of the times they're continued,|sd
but mostly they're just little vignettes.|sd
A new one we found we really like is that DINOSAURS.|sd
Have you seen that?|qy
Huh-uh.|nn
That is, it's, it's really funny.|sv
They use like animated, -|sd
it's not like a cartoon,|sd
but it's like dummies and things,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, it's really, um, -|%
and robots probably.|sd
But there's always a, a moral to each story.|sd
And what night is it on?|qw
Well, yo-, we watched it, -|^h
the times we've seen it, it's been like on Satur-, or, excuse me, Friday night.|sd
Uh, but it's, -|%
we've only seen it a couple of times.|h
But it, it's real, -|sv
the first one we saw, um, they were, it, it involved a tradition of when a per-, person reaches seventy-five,|sd
and I can't remember what day they call it,|sd
but, but, uh, the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff|sd
Oh, great.|ba
Anyway|sd
and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all,|sd
and then when it comes time for him to throw her over, well, the, the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her.|sd
Oh.|b
And she said no,|sd
you can't do, you know,|^q
he ran her out, was running to hi-, in a wheelchair to hide her,|sd
and she said, "You can't do that."|sd
Huh.|%
"This is tradition.|^q
This is what old people are supposed to be, thrown over the, the cliff."|^q
And, uh, he said, "I don't understand."|sd
It's, it's real funny that they give the teenagers the, as the one that questions, uh, the, what's going on.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, in the end of, uh, the son-in-law, when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff, uh, th-, the so-, the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says, "No, you can't do it," and then, and then, uh, "Oh, well, we've got to do it. It's tradition,"|sd
and the son was, you know, "Why?"|sd
And so,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, he doesn't.|bf
and, of course, the town thinks he's just terrible, because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it.|sd
And then we saw one where this, there was a teenage, when a teenage boy comes into his manhood,|sd
they call it the night of the howling,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they all go out and howl, you know|sd
And, and the son refused to do it.|sd
He, he did,|sd
he thought it was not ... -|sd
So he didn't go howl?|br
No,|nn
he wouldn't go howl,|sd
so all the, all the people that worked with the father ostracized him|sd
Oh, how funny.|ba
It is.|aa
It, it, it's, it's real interesting to watch the show,|sv
and, and wh-, the relationship between the family is, is really now,|sd
Huh.|%
So it's, -|%
our, our grandson, our oldest grandson is the one that, that got us to watching it.|sd
But it really is,|sv
It's a real short,|sd
and there's always, like I say, a moral to it|sd
and, -|%
It's just a half hour,|qy^d
or is it hour?|qrr
Well, half hour.|sd
Oh.|b
That, that's all there is to it.|sd
And, and, uh, they ... -|%
There's not many half hour shows,|sv
it seems like that,|sv
Yeah,|b
it, it, they, they're trying to liken the, the father in there of the teenage son to like JACKIE GLEASON SHOW.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I guess maybe there are some parts of that,|sv
but I didn't really see that in there.|sd
But what I've read about it, they talk about that.|sd
But anyway, we've, we've enjoyed that,|sd
and, and, uh, I guess mostly I, I like the news shows too, the news magazines, like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY,|sd
Yeah,|b
no,|b
I watch those if I, -|sd
but my husband likes to watch, um, old movies, especially war movies, or, or, uh, sports, which I'm not,|sd
Oh, see, I like sports.|sd
No,|ar
I don't.|sd
Well, I, I do, I like ice skating|sd
and I like, uh, gymnastics,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but I, I, -|%
and I'll watch snippets of baseball games|sd
and I, I just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I don't ever, no matter what's on, I don't ever just sit and watch T V.|sd
I'm usually either doing dishes,|sd
or I may be sewing,|sd
or, you know,|sd
I know.|b
or I may be working around in the room somehow,|sd
but I don't, I don't ever just sit and, -|sd
I, that's something that comes from your old age, you know.|sv
No,|b
I don't sit.|sd
Idle hands are the devil's workshop|^q
I know.|aa
Who has time?|qh
I don't have time to sit, I know.|sd
No.|b
It's, it's, uh, -|%
That's why I don't get to watch that much.|sd
I mean, I,|sd
Right.|b
I do okay, because the kids are all in bed,|sd
but before that, I really, there's not much time.|sd
Right.|b
Or like at six thirty I'll watch WHEEL OF FORTUNE or something like that.|sd
Right,|b
well, our, -|%
yeah,|%
if our gra-, if our grandchildren are with us, that's, they have to watch that.|sd
We don't watch it unless they're here|sd
Uh-huh.|b
No,|%
I like that.|sd
No,|%
I'll watch,|sd
But they, uh, -|%
but,|b
It's, it's, um, oh, -|%
and, you know, the, the kids will get you started on stuff like AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS.|sd
We've wound up sending in one.|sd
That's something I didn't think that we'd ever do|sv
Did you send one?|qy
Yeah.|ny
My oldest grandson pulling his tooth.|sd
He's, he's,|sd
How funny.|ba
and I mean, it, it got to the point he was eating a pear here,|sd
and he bit into it,|sd
and it was just hanging by a thread.|sd
And I, and I'd tell him, you know, it's getting ready to fall out,|sd
and he walked around the house with his fa-, face down toward the floor and his mouth open, hoping it would because he wouldn't let anybody pull it.|sd
And he wou-, he wound up pull, -|sd
Hello?|fp
Hi.|fp
Hi,|fp
my name is Leslie.|sd
Hi,|fp
I'm Jennifer.|sd
And where are you from?|qw
Pennsylvania.|sd
Oh, nice,|ba
I'm from Dallas, Texas.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah,|ny
so, -|%
Oh, that's neat.|ba
Well, did you understand what this was for, you know, what it was for, what we, -|qy
Uh, television shows?|qy^d
Yeah|ny
Sure,|b
that sounds good.|sv
Okay|b
I, I don't watch too many,|sd
but we can try it.|sd
Okay.|b
Are you ready to start?|qy
Sure am.|na
Okay,|bk
just a minute|ad
Okay,|b
I guess we're recording now.|sv
Yeah,|b
okay.|b
What are your favorite television shows?|qw
Well, I don't really watch too many T V shows other than, uh, occasionally I'll, I'll turn on DONAHUE because it comes on in the morning when I seem to be getting ready around here.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
And, uh, so if, if there's no one else around, you know, it's just me and I have a chance to listen to something, I'll turn that on, but, uh, just for the, for the conversation factor, I think,|sd
but, and then I think I enjoy when I catch it, I don't even know what night it's on, but DESIGNING WOMEN sometimes,|sd
Oh, I love that show.|sv
Yeah,|b
do you?|qy
Yes,|ny
that is great.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it's fun.|sv
And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught occa-, a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL, I think.|sd
Oh, I heard they just canceled that.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.|sd
It is a real different one.|sv
It's, uh, it's, it's different.|sv
I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.|sv
But, -|%
Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?|qy
No,|nn
I haven't watched that.|sd
Oh, it's, it's really good.|sv
It's, uh, I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and it's set in post World War Two times|sd
and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through.|sd
It's really interesting.|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
It's kind of like a s-, a nighttime soap opera type thing.|sv
Sounds neat.|ba
It is, it's a good, it's really well written.|sv
Yeah.|b
Is that on, what chan-, what station?|qw
Uh, I don't even know, to tell you the truth|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
What other shows do you like?|qw
Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Well, she comes on later|sd
and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up --|sd
Oh.|b
I did watch soap operas,|sd
but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore.|sd
Yeah|b
and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?|sd
That's right|aa
They're stupid|sv
Yeah.|b
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But not anymore.|sd
That can happen.|sv
So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?|qo
Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS.|sd
Oh, that's always fun.|sv
Yes,|aa
I like that show.|sd
Yeah.|b
And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
So -|%
Uh-huh.|b
It's exciting,|sv
we're winning,|sd
so that's really exciting.|sv
Yeah,|b
well, I think, -|sv
I also, course, like to catch the news during the evening hours --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, uh, it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time.|sd
So, usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in.|sd
Yes,|b
we watch C N N in morning while we're getting ready --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We'll catch our news that way.|sd
Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
So what have you seen interesting on OPRAH WINFREY lately?|qw
Lately, I haven't been catching it because of my work schedule.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I can't remember the last time I saw it.|sd
It's been a while.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, I don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not|sd
I don't know,|sd
sometimes they come on and, and say.|sd
Oh, that's right.|aa
Well, today on C N N they were talking about something like this about, uh, learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing, helping them get a data base for words.|sd
Um, yeah.|b
It was really interesting.|sv
It is interesting.|aa
So, -|%
Do you work for Texas Instruments?|qy
No,|nn
no,|nn
just, uh, doing this as a fund-raiser for our church.|sd
Oh, that's nice.|ba
Yeah,|b
so it kind of makes it easy, you know, to do a little something for it.|sd
Sure,|b
because we, uh, we've talked to a lot of people from Texas, it seems,|sd
and we thought, well, maybe they work from, for Dallas, -|sd
Uh, well, uh, to begin,|%
I guess, uh, space is, uh, real important, I think,|sv
so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time, I guess.|sv
So. -|%
Yeah,|aa
I, I agree --|aa
Uh.|%
-- it's definitely new frontier stuff.|sv
So, uh, -|%
but, uh, I'm not too up-to-date on the space, on the space frontier,|h
but, uh, I guess they're going, going pretty far into it now.|sv
Um, Star Wars is not too far I don't think.|sv
But, uh, -|%
I, I, I worked on some of it at T I --|sd
Oh, have you.|qh
Yeah.|ny
So what do you know about it.|qw
Well, actually I'm, I, I'm quite versed lately.|sd
I get on a computer network all the time,|sd
and people are talking about, about the current space program all the time.|sd
They're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that, you know, are just like science fiction, you know,|sd
it's like they,|sd
and then they land, with the, with the, you know, -|sd
the afterburners are going, you know, not like space shuttle landing, you know, gliding down, but --|sd
Really.|b
Oh, my gosh.|ba
Yeah,|b
it's called V C X or something like that.|sd
Also called Delta Clipper, which is a decent name for --|sd
Wow.|ba
Well, I don't know.|h
You think you'd, you think you'd, uh, go up in space if you had a chance?|qy
Oh, yeah --|ny
Do you,|bh
-- I think I would.|sd
I think that'd be neat.|sv
I think I would just sitting here talking about it,|sv
but if the time came, it'd be real nervous.|sv
I'd be scared,|sd
scared me worse than Six Flags roller coaster.|sd
That'd be pretty hairy.|sv
Well, you know, I had a car, uh, uh, a tire come off of a car,|sd
so you know, I, like I know what it's like to -|sd
Yeah,|aa
imagine.|ba
Depending on what was left of my technology to get me home|sd
Right,|aa
right.|aa
So, well, I guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff, now, wherever.|sv
Yeah,|aa
they're talking about doing that again, too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't know if we'll ever see that up there.|sv
Well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years.|sd
Oh, really.|bh
Yeah,|ny
and they're going to put, -|sd
That's all beyond my imagination really.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, science fiction books,|sd
I mean, you look at the Jetsons, you know, cartoon show, and it's not too far fetched what, what they all had in those cartoons,|sv
so you never know.|sv
Oh, yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Any of that stuff from the Jetsons, from that cartoon, that you would never imagine would come, become possible, and now you, we have a lot of those,|sv
so, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
So you never know what, what may occur,|sv
but --|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't know,|sd
but I think it's real vital important for the future, you know --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
I, uh, -|%
it's, it's, it's something definitely that, uh, you know, -|sv
it's, it's, uh, got the extra little oomph of interest.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh.|%
I'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too, once it becomes, you know, like it's more possible,|sv
but --|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I wish, uh, -|sd
like, uh, Boeing or --|sd
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they'd go up, you know, and do things|sd
and, -|%
So did they scratch those, uh, that Star Wars deal, you know, they one we was all worried about -- the "they" in this sentence should probably be a|qy
Oh.|b
No,|nn
it's still probably going,|sv
but I don't know whether, it, it, research will go on.|sd
Yeah,|b
but the economy the way it is all over, they probably cut back on --|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
Well, they're, they're going to be cutting back so much on just, you know, the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number --|sd
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
I know,|sd
and then, -|%
But, uh, Russia's still going to have missiles,|sd
they're still going to be subs and things.|sd
Yeah,|b
and we don't know who's handling them now --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- so that's a whole different story now.|sd
Latest I heard it was just going to be Russia that, Russia itself that was going to have them.|sd
Oh, really.|bh
At least that was, you know, that's what everybody says.|h
Oh, yeah,|^q
yeah,|^q
we want only Russia to have them.|^q
Uh-huh.|b
And now they're saying, Yeah,|sd
yeah,|^q
you're a republic,|^q
you don't want those,|^q
you don't want those.|^q
Some crazy hit man over there so,|sv
they splitting it all up now,|sd
and one of them crazy --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
you never know.|sv
But that, the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev, he's supposed to be, he's supposed to be on our side, isn't he.|qy
Pretty much.|sv
One hopes.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects|sv
so, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
But that way, you can't never tell that.|sv
Yeah.|b
Kiss some butt,|bf
but,|%
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Uh, do you want to go ahead|qy
or, -|%
Oh, sure.|na
Uh, well I, uh, went to school at Madison for two years|sd
and they are really big on women's rights.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And so I, I've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that.|sd
But, uh, I'm not that liberated.|sd
I mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, I, you know, you pick up some traits from her and stuff.|sd
But, uh, I think it's, I think it's interesting and better for women to see that there's more, more of them doing men's fields.|sv
I like to see that.|sd
And --|sd
Right.|b
but, you know, I, I believe in like sharing and doing things for each other.|sd
I do too.|sd
I like the idea.|sd
I see a lot more, uh, -|sd
my children, I have five children|sd
and they're all married.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I love seeing the men help the women so much.|sd
Right.|b
And they both cooperate together on, -|sd
I think it's great.|sv
Oh, me too|aa
I hope that happens to me someday.|sd
I mean, I, I don't mind --|sd
Uh, I have a boyfriend|sd
and I got to make him dinner and stuff|sd
but, you know, I, he'll help me do the dishes.|sd
I don't want to, you know --|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|%
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
Yeah.|b
So -|%
I've always taught my men that.|sd
They better clean up with their women and help them.|sd
If they did that, you know. -|sd
Right.|b
And they're, they're good about it.|sd
But it is neat to see them all work together.|sv
And --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
they, they stay at work or go back to work. Or whatever.|sd
Right.|b
And they're well educated.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And I believe we'll see a lot more C E O -s in companies.|sv
They're having a fit about how little there are.|sd
Oh.|b
And I think we'll see a lot more. Don't you? Of upper management?|qy
Oh, yeah.|ny
Uh-huh.|ny
Right.|b
I think it'll escalate.|sv
Yeah.|b
And, uh, and I think black women now -|sv
i-, in fact I work at a high school.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted|sd
and she's very sharp.|sd
And I think that th-, -|sv
and the ethnic thing will be, you know, is a good thing now.|sv
Oh, me too.|aa
They're moving them up|sd
and they're sharp|sd
and they, -|%
so you're going to see a lot, a lot more of that in leadership I believe.|sv
Yeah.|b
I like to see that.|sd
I think it's, uh, really neat to see and all that educated minority, uh, person --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And --|sd
Right.|b
That's|sv
Especially black women.|sv
Yes.|aa
So. -|%
Yeah.|b
But they know what they're doing.|^q
Right.|b
But I'm not big on subserving as far as --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
But I never have gone along with that, you know. Even far back.|sd
But I was brought up pretty good in a home that, -|sd
years ago my mother was that way.|sd
The same. -|sd
I, -|%
my bo-, -|%
ther-, you know, -|%
some people say oh the boys shouldn't have to do those jobs. The inside jobs.|sv
But we never were taught, -|sd
they had to do as much as we did.|sd
So that was good.|sv
Right,|aa
same here.|aa
Yeah.|%
So that's, I think that's good. To keep the equal as far as, as, uh, not, nex-, nex-, uh, necessarily by sex type thing.|sv
Right.|aa
Same here.|aa
You should be able to accomplish as much.|sv
And I think the, uh, attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls, you know --|sv
Yeah.|b
If he --|sd
Yeah.|b
Exactly.|aa
I, I see more men, uh, like participating in like the family things with children.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
What about politics on it?|qo
Oh.|b
Do you think the political scene? -|qy
I'm not that big on politics.|^h
I'm not --|sd
Yeah.|b
I'm, -|%
I'm real dis-, I'm kind of disgusted this year because I don't see many women into the political scene|sd
and I really think we should have more --|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
I agree with that.|aa
there's nobody again.|sd
I think they're all scared out after tha-, after, uh, -|sd
oh, what was the lady's name that ran a couple of, -|qw
Fitz-, -|%
I forget her name now.|sd
Oh, I don't know|sd
But you know who I mean?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I know who you're talking about.|sd
Yeah.|b
She took such a rough go of it.|sv
And they t-, their tax deal and, -|sd
Yeah.|b
At least she was strong to like try it and you know.|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
So that's good.|sv
But I wish they would get some more on that.|sd
I really was disappointed this year when I see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about.|sd
Uh, they, I didn't see any of the women in there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And that disappoints me.|sd
Oh.|b
And right now I don't think we have too many. Uh, th-, in the forefront.|sd
Schroeder's about the biggest one in Washington.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Congress woman.|sd
And, uh, other th-, uh, -|%
we really, -|%
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I think the first thing they said, -|sd
I have written this down|sd
so it would, -|%
is it p-, do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government?|^q
Okay.|b
You're asking what my opinion about,|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
Well, I suspect that it is possible.|sv
Uh, I think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody.|sv
Right.|aa
That's a good point.|sv
But, uh, other than that I think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty.|sv
That's an int-, you know, that's interesting.|sv
I had read something one time|sd
and it was just applying to governments in general,|sd
it was written many years ago.|sd
It said that it's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers.|sd
And I thought that was interesting.|sv
It wasn't just talking about our government.|sd
It was just government in general. From times past, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, -|%
So they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers.|bf
Right.|aa
And that would be a next question to ask.|sd
or are they in there for their own gains,|qrr
and personally I feel it's probably, there's probably some of each.|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
But I think maybe a lot of them, um, -|sv
say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves, it may be more matter of not what can I steal while in an office but how many friends can I make while,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
And, you know, how good a name can I make for myself and so forth.|^q
So I guess it would be like anything else.|sv
Yeah.|b
The president of General Motors probably has the same, -|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
And they talked, uh, -|sd
the other, let's see. -|^h
Third question was how m-, serving for their own gains do you think goes on, -|sd
then they, -|%
that's hard to answ-,|sv
I'm sure there's a lot. But I agree with you, there's a lot in business.|sd
I think that's just, I think that's very normal,|sv
I think I-,|sv
I think we put too much on politicians.|sv
We expect them to only be there to serve us, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
If you knew what you were getting when you voted, uh, -|sv
That's a problem, isn't it?|qy
Yeah.|ny
It's interesting|sv
because I'm taking a Texas government class right now,|sd
and one of the things -|sd
it's so easy to blame them to -|sv
a lot of times I think it's our own fault.|sv
They lie to us because we don't want to hear the truth.|sv
Yeah,|aa
they say you,|sd
And it, -|%
If they tell us the truth, we don't elect them and,|sv
Uh-huh|b
and I don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore.|sd
It's hard to imagine.|sv
Because it's,|sv
we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life|sv
and, and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at|sv
Yeah,|aa
and it almost seems like in order to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find, on, say in the Bobsy twins or,|sv
Right.|b
You know, I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out.|sv
I don't think there would be too many left|sv
So you're taking a government course?|qy^d
Uh-huh.|ny
At what?|qw
The university?|qy^d
Uh, at, uh, it's T C J C.|sd
Tex-, Tarrant County Junior College.|sd
Oh.|b
Yeah.|b
Okay.|bk
And it's really, it's really enjoyable.|sd
I like it.|sd
And then they also, you know, ask can we eliminate, do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption,|sd
and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally.|sv
You can make laws against corruption|sv
Yeah,|aa
but that,|sv
But that doesn't eliminate it, does it?|^2
I don't think making laws will stop it.|sv
I mean I don't know how many laws you would have to have.|sd
I mean, -|%
No,|nn
sure didn't,|qy
So no,|aa
I think you can legislate|sv
but I think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating,|sv
and we would end up with so many more laws that, you know, -|sv
I mean I just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government, in business, personal life, I mean, you know.|sv
Actually, I think other countries may have it worse, uh,|sv
the Japanese government is always having a, some kind of a scandal.|sd
Right.|b
Usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, uh, -|%
Yeah,|b
I still believe I get very fed up with government sometimes|sd
but when I think about where I'd want to go, you know, this is still the best|sd
or I can, -|%
Yeah,|aa
I've been around to a few other countries|sd
and I, uh, I, I have not found one yet that I would rather live in.|sd
I think, uh, -|%
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
at its worst I think we've got the best.|sv
Okay, um, Chuck, do you have any pets there at your home?|qy
Yeah, I do.|ny
And what kind do you have?|qw
I've got a male Siamese about a year old here.|sd
I live alone in an apartment, and, uh, --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh|b
How about you?|qo
Well, we have a cat, um,|sd
he's probably, oh, a good two years old, big, old, fat and sassy tabby.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh. Uh, how's the disposition of your Siamese cat?|qw
Well, it's, uh, you know they're just, uh, aggressive by nature --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, he's been neutered and declawed,|sd
so --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so, uh, that kind of calms him down for the most part.|sd
How about yours?|qo
Well, yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
he's, uh, he has been really aggressive, uh, especially towards my little girl, for --|sd
Huh.|b
He's, uh, been so mean to her|sd
And, and you say you've had him how long?|qw^d
We've had him for about two years --|sd
Two years.|b^m
-- and he was so mean to her, um, right after we first got him.|sd
So we had him neutered, and, and declawed,|sd
and now he bites her.|sd
He can't --|sd
Huh.|b
he bites her.|sd
Does he bite her enough to draw blood?|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
he has a couple of times,|sd
so. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
But he's a very possessive cat.|sd
He, he loves my son,|sd
it's his cat,|sd
and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and he's so funny,|sd
he just follows my son around just like a dog.|sd
Huh.|b
He won't even let my son shower.|sd
Yeah.|b
He meows and wants to get in the bathroom|sd
and, while he showers, it's so hilarious.|sd
So he's quite a animal|sd
Yeah,|b
boy,|ba
I guess.|sv
Well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive. I guess with the daughter he's all right.|sv
Yeah.|b
You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something.|sv
Yeah,|b
well, we, we did, uh, actually take him to the pound a couple of times, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Sure.|b
but, uh, he seems to have mellowed out a little bit,|sd
and we do keep our daughter away from him.|sd
So. -|%
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house|sd
Is that the only pet that you have?|qy
It is,|na
uh-huh.|ny
We, we tried a dog about four years ago, and we ended up with, uh, oh, malamute and some other kind of mix.|sd
Anyway it was, it ended up being just a huge, huge dog that ate us out of house and home.|sd
So, we gave him up and tried.|sd
Well, do you live, you, you in a house, or a place where you, uh, -|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh,|ny
we're in a house,|sd
but we're in a subdivision --|sd
I see.|bk
we couldn't allow him to run free,|sd
so, he was just chained up all the time,|sd
and it was, it was --|sd
Sure.|b
So have you tried any other pets?|qy
No,|nn
no.|nn
I, I live alone in an apartment,|sd
and, uh, it's, it's not that big that, uh -- -|sd
Oh|b
-- although I've heard rabbits are pretty good --|sd
Oh.|b
-- you know, I saw something on C N N or on cable here --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, my word.|ba
and they apparently, uh, -|sd
especially when they're young when they bring them in -- -|sd
Oh, my word.|ba
-- uh,|%
And do they, they just paper train it or something?|qy
I guess.|na
I guess,|na
yeah,|%
and I would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with, either.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, rabbits are darling.|sv
That would be fun if you could get them trained.|sv
Otherwise they're pretty smelly|sv
Yep,|aa
that's right.|aa
Oh.|%
Did you see the, the C N N, the, the dog show, uh,|qy
Huh-uh,|nn
we don't have C, we don't have cable.|sd
I see.|bk
Well they have, uh, uh, a Wesmin-, they call it the Westminster Dog Show, uh,|sd
I think it's in New York City at the, at the Gardens|sd
there once a year live -- -|sd
Oh.|%
-- and they had that on last week,|sd
and that's really kind of something --|sv
Oh.|%
it's on, I think, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two --|sd
Is that right?|bh
-- and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there.|sv
Oh|%
Some of them are really beautiful, too.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So. -|%
Well, I'd be, interesting to watch.|sd
So you live in Utah do you?|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
Elton.|sd
Goodness.|ba
We live out here by, it's by Ogden.|sd
It's north of Salt Lake City, Utah --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we really love it out here.|sd
It's, uh, kind of country.|sd
We're, we're only about ten minutes from Ogden.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, we're kind of country but not too.|sd
Well do you all work for T I, or for, -|qy
No,|nn
huh-uh.|nn
Do you?|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
Oh, well, see, I'm getting so many calls to Texas.|sd
This is the very first one I've, I've talked to.|sd
Oh, well, great.|ba
Yeah,|b
I've been doing it for about two weeks|sd
and, uh, no my,|%
Uh-huh.|b
So how do you get most of your current event information?|qw
Well, , see I'm going to school right now,|sd
and, uh, --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I don't watch T V as much really either, because, uh, my free time is kind of, -|sd
and I do, like to do other stuff with it.|sd
Right.|b
While I'm at work sometimes, I, on the computer network --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and that's kind of helpful.|sd
I would imagine going to college, though, your professors and different things, -|sv
you keep up on what's going on.|sv
That's true,|aa
I mean, my roommates and stuff, you know --|sd
Yeah.|b
And the people I work with are pretty, you know, up, up-to-date on that kind of stuff,|sd
so. -|%
Right.|b
Well, I'm a housewife,|sd
I have three kids,|sd
and so --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Do you watch, do you watch the network, like major network news,|qy
or do you watch like --|qrr
Just the regular channel --|sd
Oh, really.|b
That's our channel here|sd
that's the, um, eyewitness news.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So. -|%
Oh, ch-, see channel, where I am channel eight's, um, like public T V, -|sd
so it's kind of different.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
I think, I think the, uh, -|sv
I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on,|sv
but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news.|sv
Right.|aa
And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not,|sv
and basically --|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.|sv
I think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
because they can, they can only report on, I mean, -|sv
they give each candidate perhaps, you know, ten second blurbs in which to, you know, to say, you, you just can't get a full picture of, you know --|sv
Right.|b
Right.|aa
And the news, too, it just doesn't, um, cover that many stories,|sv
I mean, it just covers your basic, you know, violent crimes --|sv
Yeah.|b
but other than that, you really don't know what's going on.|sv
Yeah.|b
Um, I will read our current letters that come out on elections|sd
and, I guess I do read that,|sd
and I do study who's running in our area,|sd
and I do study what's going on in the economy.|sd
It, you know, -|%
and, I guess I do read other magazines, um, too, to get my information.|sd
What kind of, see, -|qw
I subscribe to like SCIENCE NEWS,|sd
and that's, that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of, or like the updates, like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would, you know, bog me down that I wouldn't know about --|sd
Right.|b
-- but other than that I don't really read,|sd
I don't, I don't really subscribe to anything else.|sd
I used to read every month a READER'S DIGEST --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, um, now I guess I just have friends that clip articles|sd
or if I, you know, am interested in something, of course, during the w-, when we were in war, I read up on that just a little in the newspaper --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
But a lot of the times, I, you know, I wish I had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper,|sd
but I just can't seem to find the time.|sd
Yeah.|b
If they put it out in a video, or on|sd
Yeah.|b
But, -|%
Well, I remember back during the, uh, during the war, everyone here at work always had the radio or the T V on, because that, they were going constantly with that stuff.|sd
Right.|b
But, uh. -|%
Well, I, um, they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of,|sd
and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news.|sd
You know, we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- that we want to hear what's going on with the economy, what's being done to help it, what's going on in other countries, what's, you know, just more information.|sd
If they reported every, if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take, it would probably take the whole news hour|sv
Yeah.|b
But, uh. -|%
Well, I guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the, uh, summer olympics|qy^d
Oh, yeah,|ny
that's, -|%
they start, already they're having like, um, -|sd
in the newspaper they have a section, I think, every now and then, on the Olympics, you know,|sd
and they've got like a countdown,|sd
it's like sixteen hundred days or something.|sd
I know, we're trying to get tickets to it right now.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah.|ny
That's going to be crazy that time of year here.|sv
But, uh. -|%
Yeah.|b
I can't believe, I mean, -|sd
they're, they're stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over,|sd
I guess people want to hear about it.|sd
Also big in the news right now is the Braves, because they're, uh, they're in, you know, tr-, spring training or whatever --|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
-- and they did so well last year.|sd
Yeah,|b
they spent a lot of time, that's another thing, they spend a long time on sports,|sd
and I think that, um, that's fine, I would like to see more time spent on other things.|sd
Yeah.|b
But. -|%
It seems like, -|sv
I don't know,|h
they way they do the newscasts, I wish they, they kind of separated it, you know,|sd
if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it|sd
but I don't have cable.|sd
-kay, Dave.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
What kind of pets do you have?|qw
Oh, we have one rotten cat.|sd
One rotten cat|b^m
Yeah,|aa
it's my son's cat.|sd
I heard a laugh in the background.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's the boys.|sd
They know I don't like it.|sd
Don't you like cats?|qy
Well, I like cats.|sd
This, this cat is a, uh, more like a dog.|sd
Oh yeah.|b
Yeah|b
he's, uh, a one owner.|sd
He likes one boy in the family and that's about it|sd
That's odd.|ba
How does he treat the other people?|qw
Just, uh, stays away or runs --|sd
Wow.|ba
But he follows, he'll follow my oldest son around.|sd
You know when he is in the house, he will come up and he'll jump on his lap,|sd
but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever, he'll just kind of look at them like what are doing.|sd
Did he raise him or something?|qy
He's, he, we bought the cat for him|sd
and so he's, uh, been the one that you know spent the most time with him.|sd
But I, I've never owned a cat like that.|sd
I've had cats growing up all the time|sd
and you know they are --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Huh, that's interesting.|ba
So, it's a weird cat|sd
Huh. We have a, a mutt.|sd
A mutt.|b^m
Well, we, we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, some lady, she, uh, -|sd
a lot of people, uh, uh, drop off abandoned, abandoned pets at her house --|sd
Oh.|b
-- and she use to work for a veter-, veterinarian|sd
so she would spay-, uh, neuter them --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we saw an ad saying it was free,|sd
so we went down there and picked it up|sd
and it's been an excellent dog,|sd
but it's my first dog I've had|sd
and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work.|sd
So that, is that, is that kind of your child right now?|qy^d
Uh yeah.|ny
Right now it, it is.|sd
You feel like.|bf
It's kind of good training.|sd
I mean we have been trying for kids,|sd
but --|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
but it's pretty good training, I think really, keeps her on her toes|sd
Have, have you had dogs before?|qy
Uh, my brother has.|sd
Uh, we didn't do a lot with them.|sd
Uh, I never felt like it was mine or anything,|sd
you couldn't do anything.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, I mean, that did, did more responsibility. When its yours and not your brother's|sd
Yeah.|b
But, -|%
Well, I just, uh, we've, you know -|%
when I was growing up I had, we always had a dog|sd
and we had mostly mutts,|sd
well not mutts, but mixes --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs.|sv
That's what we found.|sd
Ours is, uh, like a cockapoo.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, it's a really good dog.|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't know,|h
they seem to be, I mean, listen better or something.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Is your cat a purebred?|qy
No.|nn
No,|nn
it's just uh an accident|sd
From a frie-, uh, from my, my son's friend down the street.|sd
They're --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and so, -|%
Would you ever want a dog in the family?|qy
Uh, we, I would.|na
We, uh, we had a dog that was a, uh, mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I should say a pup|sd
and he was just too big for our kids --|sd
Oh yeah.|b
and we, when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was, uh, you know, was a pet|sd
and it was a dog that we gotten|sd
and he was, he was just too big.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, the kids couldn't handle him|sd
and I was still going to school|sd
and my wife was working|sd
and I was working|sd
and so we just didn't have time to really train him|sd
so he was kind of jus-, you know, he was too big for the kids to handle,|sd
so he was just tied up to a post --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
-- so we gave him to, uh, -|sd
I don't know if you've, -|sd
there is a place out here, uh, called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they have, uh, -|sd
I guess it's kind of an animal shelter|sd
but he just takes a few the animals in|sd
and some he destroys|sd
and some he keeps.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So we took him up there|sd
and he ended up keeping him.|sd
Uh, cause he has had him for six or seven years.|sd
We, we've, saw him just about a year ago|sd
and, uh, I thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so we asked him about it one day|sd
and he said yeah,|sd
he's been the best dog I've ever had in my life --|^q
Wow.|ba
-- just goes everywhere with him.|sd
I, he would have been a great, great dog.|sd
He just needed a lot of time.|sd
Hello.|fp
Hello,|fp
Hi.|fp
Hello|fp
this is Lois.|fp
Hi,|fp
hi,|fp
this is Lisa.|fp
And, uh, I called you know, from that, the, the T I Data Base Calling Instructions.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
I got a call yesterday too.|sd
This is a different subject though.|sd
Yeah,|b
this is about changes in the women in the, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, there's really a lot, isn't there.|qy
Yeah|ny
I think there really is.|sv
It's kind of an easy thing to talk about.|sv
Oh, I guess the work force would be the main, wouldn't it.|qy
Yeah, uh,|ny
I think you have to push one|ad
and then we can start recording it.|ad
Okay|aa
All right.|aa
Okay.|b
Are you ready now?|qy
Yes.|ny
Okay,|b
like I said I guess it would be the work force, you know, as far as changes in the generations.|sv
Yes,|aa
I know because, I know when my mother was a, you know, going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her, I guess,|sd
she's in her late forties.|sd
You were expected to stay home and take care of the kids|sd
and I've never faced that at all.|sd
Uh, no,|aa
I think no-, now, you go to work when they're six weeks old,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and you stay there.|sv
And I feel like the next generation, you'll probably just work right along with your husband, you know.|sv
Yeah,|aa
uh-huh,|aa
I think it's definitely gotten better.|sv
Oh, I do to, much.|aa
And it's just going to get better.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It really is.|sv
Because women are in every field now,|sd
I mean I can't think of a field that they're not involved in.|sd
Oh, I can't either, not a one.|sd
And I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing.|sv
Yeah,|b
even in Washington, you know,|sv
Yeah.|b
Hopefully, the next generation, it won't even be an issue,|sv
I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman,|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
I think that would be the best goal.|sv
Oh, I do too,|aa
just your qualifications|bf
and that would be it.|bf
Uh-huh,|aa
exactly,|aa
not what color you are, how old you are, what your male or female.|sv
That would be wonderful,|sv
I guess it's kind of an ideal world though, huh|sv
Yeah,|aa
I kind of think, maybe in time, that, you know, you'll go by social security numbers, you know,|sv
Yeah.|b
and that way they can't say well they picked a male over a female, female over a male, you know,|sv
Exactly,|aa
or the way you look,|sv
or the way you, you know, -|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
your age or anything.|sv
I think that would be a wonderful way to do it.|sv
I do to|aa
just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications that, you know, that you have.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
and then, -|%
And then if you get it, you know then, -|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
also, with, uh, women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as, you know, what's it called, job sharing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job,|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
As a matter of fact, that's what I'm doing.|sd
Is it.|bh
Uh-huh,|ny
it sure is.|sd
That would be great.|sv
It sure is.|aa
Or, a lot of women I know now and my, uh, one of my supervisors, when she went on L O A to have her baby, we hooked up, uh, uh, a terminal at her house|sd
and she, you know, we could send her messages,|sd
and, and she kept in touch like that,|sd
Oh.|b
I would just take her the actual paperwork once, uh, every week or two,|sd
and that worked out great too.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah|aa
that is.|sv
And that's a real attractive option, if you have the, the technology for it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
All it was, was, you know, -|sd
I mean, she just used a phone modem|sd
and she was like she was sitting in the office,|sd
so I think that's real nice too, to come up with different options.|sv
Do you like the job sharing?|qy
Oh, I do,|na
Do you?|bh
I really do,|sd
I think it's great.|sd
Do you work like half days, or half weeks or, -|qy
Uh, well like, one week she'll work three days and I'll work two|sd
and she'll work two,|sd
Oh, oh that's great,|ba
and we just share off like that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Do you get the full benefits?|qy
Uh-huh,|ny
yeah|ny
we get the full benefits.|sd
Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
But we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under.|sd
Yeah,|aa
especially with children, and so many things going on,|sv
Yeah.|b
It really is,|sd
and that way we're not really missing any thing out, you know,|sd
Either way, -|^2
uh-huh.|%
yeah,|aa
you have your career and your home life,|bf
and that would be a nice way, especially if you have young children.|sv
Oh, it is,|sd
it is,|sd
well both of ours is school age,|sd
but we don't want to miss any of those P T A -s and, you know, all of that.|sd
Uh-huh,|aa
oh, no,|aa
I think, -|%
yeah.|%
My son's just in day-care|sd
but even that they have extracurricular activities|sd
and the older they get the more that you're involved in that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think it's great,|sv
I really, -|%
Yeah,|b
and I look for more of that in the next generation.|sd
I do too, especially as women get up in management and, and can be in on those decision making, -|sd
you know, when that subject comes up they can say yes,|sd
that would be wonderful.|sv
Yes,|aa
oh, I do too.|sd
Plus, I bet it cuts, cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything,|sv
so you don't have to, you know, unless you're just really sick, or the child's sick.|sv
Most of the time now, you know, it's just the weekend,|sd
or just forget it.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
oh yeah,|b
I have to plan way in advance, because, -|sd
or, what I've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's been real helpful too,|sd
like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening.|sd
So that's real helpful,|sd
so you don't, you know, have to do it during office hours, run out on your lunch hour.|sd
I don't know how many times I've done that to do something,|sd
To do,|b^m
yeah.|b
so. -|%
Uh-huh.|aa
Well I think we've really come a long way in that because, -|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
I guess I take it for granted, kind of, because, I just, -|sd
it's always been that way.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But I know, -|%
Yeah,|b
but I can rem-, remember back growing up, my mother, -|sd
I mean it was -|%
she always worked,|sd
but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off.|sd
Oh no,|aa
I can remember my mother getting in trouble if, you know, one of was sick,|sd
and I know she probably didn't make hardly anything, you know, compared to the work that she did.|sd
Oh yeah.|aa
I think there is still some discrimination there where as, you know, men and women work in the same job,|sd
I think men get paid more,|sd
Oh, I do too.|aa
but I think that's improving.|sv
It's such a slow process|sv
it's frustrating,|sv
but,|sv
Yes,|b
yes.|b
and you just want to make it right,|sv
but at least the wheels are moving forward.|sv
They really are.|aa
Yeah,|aa
I think it's getting better, not worse.|sv
Well, I should probably get back to my job|fc
I know,|fc
I know the feeling.|fc
Call again.|fc
Okay,|fc
I sure will.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Okay,|fc
bye-bye.|fc
Hello.|fp
Hello.|fp
Hey, how you doing?|fp
Not bad,|fp
not bad.|fp
What's your name?|fp
Fernando.|fp
Fernando.|b^m
My name is Nick.|fp
Wait.|ad
Let me turn off my stereo here|oo_co_cc
Sure|aa
Because I've been, like, waiting, like, for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody.|sd
Really?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Phew like a whistling|ba
Man, I'm, -|%
Yeah.|b
What time is it over th-,|qw
are you, are you in Dallas?|qy
No,|nn
no.|nn
I'm in Detroit.|sd
Or not Detroit. I'm in, uh, California.|ar
Are you?|bh
Yeah.|ny
I . -|%
Because every time I got through, I went to Dallas, Texas.|sd
Really?|bh
Yeah.|ny
I'm in North Carolina.|sd
Oh.|b
Well, you're on the, uh, -|bf
let's see,|^h
On the other coast|^2
Yeah,|aa
twenty-one like he is talking to someone other than|t3
Yeah.|%
Shoot man, it's, what, midnight almost?|qy^d
What?|br
Yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
It's, uh, -|%
I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here.|sd
Yeah,|b
okay.|b
All right.|b
Well I guess we're supposed to talk,|sd
what about|qw
credit card?|qy
W-, wait.|ad
Wh-, what did, how, how did you get to know about the T I thing?|qw
Oh, one of my instructors, uh, said that they were doing something like this|sd
and. -|%
Wha-, what are you working on|qw
A, a Masters in, uh, information systems.|sd
Really.|bh
I'm doing my Masters in, in computer science and computer engineering.|sd
Yeah?|bh
Where at?|qw
At North Carolina State University.|sd
Hey.|ba
How do you like it out there|qw
Uh, I don't. Because, uh, I come from a lot, a bigger city than this one|sd
and --|sd
Yeah.|b
and, -|%
Oh.|b
Raleigh Durham.|bf
Yeah.|%
Yeah.|aa
That area.|sd
And it's really small.|sd
All, all you have is like towns built around universities.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Like Chapel Hill?|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
So it, it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway.|sd
Kind of quaint little towns|sd
but they --|sd
Yeah.|b
Where you at?|qw
Uh, well, I'm in Monterey, California right now|sd
Yeah.|%
Oh, okay.|bk
So, so I mean, it's like this, this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people|sd
and that's about it.|sd
Two hundred fifty?|br
Yeah.|aa
Okay.|bk
It, it's, it's a lot bigger than Monterey is.|sd
But we're just, uh, just south of, uh, San Jose and San Francisco.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
And it's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a, you know, to a large city.|sd
So, so where do you go?|qw
Do you go to Berkeley?|qy
No,|nn
no.|nn
I go to the, it's the naval postgraduate school out here.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
Because, uh, I was looking at, at the,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they're asking like for a, uh, G P A of like three point seven or something --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And like they're looking like for, uh, G R E like ninety-nine percentile and this and that.|sd
Yeah.|b
And it's like, -|%
Well, that's what they look for.|sd
Whether or not they get it is hard to say like a chair is drug across the * spelling: "dragged", not "drug" in this case|sd
Yeah,|aa
I know.|sd
That's why, that's why I didn't apply.|sd
I mean, it was like --|sd
Yeah|b
Yeah.|aa
It's pretty tough.|sv
It's pretty tough|sv
I, -|%
uh, let's face it, you know.|h
And, you know, I, you know, did the, you know, -|%
as far as, -|%
I found it a lot of times with, regards to education, you know, the school only takes you so far, you know.|sd
It's what you do.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, uh, I don't lose any sleep, sleep over stuff like that.|sd
So, are, are you going to go for your Doctorate?|qy
Probably not.|nn
See I'm in the Navy.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, you know, most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until I, -|sd
if I do do it, it will be after I get out of the Navy.|sd
When do you get out?|qw
Oh, probably be another twelve years.|sd
Oh, okay|bk
Oh, you know I like what I'm doing right now.|sd
But, uh, but what if they pay for it?|qo
Excuse me?|br
What if they pay for?|qo
If they pay for a P H D?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Nah,|nn
they won't pay for it.|sd
They've, I think they have maybe two people a year go get, get their P H D.|sd
Because I know, I know a couple of people here that work for, uh, the Army. Uh,|sd
Yeah.|b
They civilians or, uh, military?|qy
I think, I think they're military.|sd
But, I --|sd
Uh-huh|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, h-, uh, he works over in Maryland|sd
Uh-huh|b
And so he's doing his Masters here.|sd
They gave him like a scholarship like for a year.|sd
Yeah.|b
And he's doing it in like, in a year and a summer.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so he's getting that|sd
and, uh --|sd
Yeah.|b
That's why you want to join.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, this guy, -|%
I mean you can earn a lot more money|sd
so you say, -|h
I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money, once you've get your, your, your Masters.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They go, well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it|sd
so. -|%
Well, a lot of times it's, you know, a lot of times it's not the money that keeps pe-, that keeps people in .|sv
Yeah.|b
They, they like what they're doing.|sv
They, you know, they feel good about what they're doing.|sv
That type of thing.|h
It's more -|%
But I mean, I mean, you, -|%
the, -|%
once you get your Masters, you can be earning between, anywhere between like thirty-seven, forty-five thousand a year.|sd
Uh-huh|b
And --|sd
Oh, easily,|aa
I'm sure.|sv
No.|aa
Well, it depends on what rank you are, of course|arp_nd
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
I know|sd
I mean, like I say, if you're, if you're, you know, if you're at an upper level in the rank category, you know, you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year.|sd
Yeah.|b
But that's, uh, -|%
Yeah.|b
Those are few and far between though.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's like,|sd
In I B M, you can get certain points --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, everyone's a manager.|sd
But nobody can get one more point to become, you know, like whatever you need to earn so much money.|sd
Yeah.|b
Since I imagine it's fairly competitive.|sv
Yeah.|aa
It's like, -|%
no|ar
I, I mean, I B M is like, -|sd
there's a joke about I B M which says, you know, it's like, uh, -|sd
all, all the major companies get into a, a boating race, right?|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so, I B M says well we have, we have to have a team, right.|sd
Uh-huh|b
And then they come in last|sd
and they have this whole team, you know, analyze why they came in last right. Because the person asked for it.|sd
Yeah.|b
Saying, -|%
he goes, uh, the problem was that there were five people saying row, row, row and one person rowing, right.|sd
So he goes, have you come up with a -lution, uh, have you come up with a solution?|sd
They go, yeah,|sd
change the rower|^q
You know, it's like everyone's a,|sd
but, you know, it's like --|sd
Yeah.|b
so. -|%
Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.|bf
Yeah.|aa
So. -|%
Yeah.|b
I don't know,|h
that can be, that, that can really slow you down.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Well, that's the way it works.|sv
I mean, that's, that's why they're having problems.|sv
I mean, everyone's a manager|sd
and, -|%
I didn't realize that.|sd
Yeah.|b
I mean, it's like, it's like the people that actually do the work there --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then the other people just plan it, you know.|sd
It's like, it's like have you, have --|qy
push paper around.|^2
Uh-huh.|ny
like all these people are just standing, sitting around, just going, you know, like what shall we do?|sd
Has anybody thought of anything?|^q
No.|^q
And then this guy from Federal, Federal Express comes along.|sd
They go what's that? This track which it's going around the world|sd
and they can tell you where your package is anywhere, any time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so it's like the same thing with I B M. You know,|sv
so they have this think tank.|sd
And they got to come up with ideas.|sd
But, see, uh, the, the thing is, that I B M is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff.|sd
Yeah.|aa
Oh, yeah.|aa
They've got a, they've got basically a, uh, you know, a lock on a lot of the market.|sv
Yeah.|b
And a lot of times you figure, you know, with the support that they provide, you know, -|sv
people generally go with that because they figure that the, you know, you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material.|sv
Whereas if you try something different, they'll --|sv
And it fails|^2
and you're dead.|^2
why didn't you buy, why didn't you try something more mainline.|^q
Yeah.|b
Well I B M doesn't fire anybody.|sd
Because --|sd
No.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
So you quit.|sd
Uh.|b
I mean that's their policy.|sd
They never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally.|sd
Illegal or something like that,|bf
yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But they won't let you off.|sd
What they'll do is like -|sd
suppose, you know, like you're a manager.|sd
So they'll put --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's like how much paper is going in?|sd
And then you --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so you quit.|sd
So, in other words, that's the way they force --|bf
Right.|aa
That's why they can say, you know, there's no layoff --|sd
Right.|b
But it does-, they don't really say that, you know,|sd
you're, you're always going to have great career --|^q
Right.|b
He-, hey, that's kind of sad.|sv
No,|ar
but I mean, it's like, it's like they, they have just like different policy.|sd
I don't know.|h
My dad works for them|sd
but it's like I B M like never in their commercials, they never put down any other company, you know.|sd
It's like --|sd
No.|aa
Well, they're the standard right now.|sv
Or as far as that goes, you know, people think of computers, they think of I B M a lot of times.|sv
And the main, -|%
Yeah.|aa
Because see what happens is they have a good backup policy.|sd
And anybody can fix it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so that's what you're going to go for.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Well, you know, that's, that's a, that's a big thing.|sv
And, and, you know, it's like, for example, like Leading Edge.|sd
Have you ever heard of Leading Edge?|qy
Yeah.|ny
They are out of Korea right.|qy
What?|br
Leading Edge.|sd
Don't they pro-, -|qy
They, they made like, uh, small personal computers.|sd
Yeah.|b
Small P C -s.|b^m
they're out of Korea right?|qy
I don't know.|no
I don't know.|no
But what they do is, what they did, I don't know, is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, yeah|b
Yeah.|b
for example, you test a chip.|sd
It can't last seven years|sd
but it can last five.|sd
I B M says let's throw it away.|sd
Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you.|sd
Okay.|b
And so that's, -|%
I mean, they're still around I think.|sd
Yeah.|aa
I've seen, well I've seen them around anyway. You know .|sd
So, that's what they do.|sd
They buy all, all the things that I B M throws away|sd
and they , and that's why they're so compatible.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and by the time you have computer for five years, you're going to throw it away anyway. You know.|sv
Most people do.|sv
Or they have to anyway.|sv
Well, I mean, there's like, well -|%
in a way you realize, -|h
I mean, one t-, one of my teachers got this computer which, you know, -|sd
it's like, uh, voice, uh, synthesizing stuff.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And he got that.|sd
He said, you know, it's like, uh, -|sd
I was testing it * LISTEN to this sequence that begins here and ends with A.215 utt 11. I can't tell how much Speaker A is quoting, and how much he'she is directly addressing Speaker B.|^q
and it was wonderful.|^q
And then when you tried to erase and correct, you know, all the errors in your voice, it takes up all your memory.|^q
Wow.|ba
And I want more, you know.|^q
And it's like Jesus Christ, you know, -|^q
it's like why do you want more.|^q
Because it's like one second of recording.|^q
I mean you put into Wave --|^q
Uh-huh.|b
-- and you want to correct the errors into Wave,|^q
it takes so much, -|^q
I mean, it's like, -|^q
of course it does.|^q
I mean, by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model|^q
and you put it in there,|^q
and you want to correct those.|^q
And then, you know, you're trying to make the, the Wave smooth|^q
so you can approximately, -|^q
of course it's going to take a lot.|^q
Imagine, imagine --|sd
It's amazing.|ba
Yeah.|b
It's like, Jesus Christ. -|sd
Well, when you get, you know, when you get right down to it, the, uh, the more they can do for you, the more, uh, like I say, the more, the more memory they're going to require.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Both, both in terms in Ram as well as, uh, you know, standard --|sd
Yeah.|b
so. -|%
Well, like they say, like nobody can get enough, you know.|sv
It's like once you have something, -|sv
and it's like -- -|%
Oh, yeah.|aa
You find out more,|sv
-- I was watching this program on T V yesterday.|sd
In nineteen seventy-six --|sd
Yeah.|b
Right.|%
Uh-huh.|b
And they were showing this like Three D g-, Three D graphics view of like, -|sd
Like the deal?|qy^d
What?|br
No,|nn
no,|nn
no.|nn
Like a hologram?|qy^d
This is like, this is like --|sd
With just graphics on, on a, -|bf
Okay?|^g
Okay|bk
But the only thing was, that it was just lines,|sd
okay.|%
Like if you -|%
I guess, um, I'm going to school while I'm working at T I,|sd
so there's not a whole a lot of time that I've got, uh, for hobbies it seems like lately.|sd
But one of the things that I do when I've got some spare time is I do some woodworking.|sd
And that, oh, I guess, ranges anywhere from, uh, carpentry work to, um, um, some types of furniture and, um, oh, I don't know what you would call them, knickknacks, I guess, stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on|sd
and I made some, um, candle sconces that you hang on the ... -|sd
Yeah,|b
I have quite a few of those that my uncle made.|sd
There's something about working with wood that, that I enjoy, that, -|sd
I don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood|sd
but, -|%
As you know, I think it's more like the mess you make, isn't it?|sv
You don't have to worry about cleaning it up.|sd
Yeah,|aa
because it's, it's out there.|sd
You know I don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when I track in saw dust,|sd
and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that,|sd
but then, I get the opportunity to vacuum,|sd
so I guess I get some of both.|sd
What are some of your things you like to do?|qw
Well, when I have time I do like to sew,|sd
um, I had been doing a lot of crocheting.|sd
I make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them.|sd
Yeah.|b
My mother was real heavy into crafts,|sd
and I would help her with whatever she happened to be doing,|sd
and then, she would go to these, uh, arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
So, a lot of times I'd help her with that.|sd
I haven't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately|sd
we've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's a good time for gardening.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
it's been beautiful this last week|sd
but, -|%
I could do with a little less wind,|sd
but I think the, the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside.|sd
Yeah.|b
Do you find you do most of your, your, uh, crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time?|qy
I usually start in the fall.|sd
Yeah.|b
And my husband says I do it, you know, make afghans so I can keep my lap warm.|sd
Well, that's kind of what my wife says.|sd
She enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her, her legs and feet with while she is working on it.|sd
Yeah.|b
I know it seems like, she, -|sd
I think she made three this year one for, uh, my father-in-law and then a couple of brothers and sisters.|sd
So, those things they take some time to make.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I found one that's real easy,|sd
it's, it's, um, um, um, -|%
shoot, I can't even remember the name of it now,|sd
but you make it in strips.|sd
And it's real easy to do,|sd
and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that|sd
but it's, -|%
Well, that's kind of like quilting.|bf
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
I think tha-, -- -|%
Mile a Minute.|sd
That's the name of it.|sd
-- Mile a Minute.|b^m
Mile a Minute.|sd
Well, I'm not sure what she does|sd
I, I, -|%
first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across, you know, back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of, of afghan.|sd
I guess that is your standard knitting, isn't it?|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
Usually single crochet would, is, is always starts it off.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I know,|sd
If we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other, don't worry about it.|ad
We have a, a very small phone company down here.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
And my husband says that's called rinky-dink|sd
Instead of call waiting or call anything else.|bf
No,|ar
no.|ar
We can't have that down here.|sd
We get disconnected all the time.|sd
Well, I guess that's, that's one way to end a conversation.|sv
Yeah,|aa
well, it gets a little aggravating.|sd
I've got kids all over the United States|sd
and, and, you know, sometimes they get disconnected when I'm talking to them.|sd
Yeah.|b
What, -|%
have you started your garden yet?|qy
Yes.|ny
We planted, um, potatoes and onions and bell peppers.|sd
Um, boy.|ba
Uh, what else did I get in there,|t1
and jalapeno peppers.|sd
Oh, yeah,|ba
always got to have those.|sv
Yeah.|b
I think I had four, uh, jalapeno plants last year.|sd
I think one of them died,|sd
but I, I've got, s-, I've put them, I chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because I, there is no way that I can eat all of those|sd
nobody else in the family likes them,|sd
but always got to the keep those planted.|sd
Yeah,|b
oh, my husband doesn't like them either,|sd
but I can always give them away.|sd
Well, that's kind of the way I am, um.|sd
Besides they're fun to grow.|sv
I planted, uh, zucchini last year.|sd
Uh, I planted four hills of them.|sd
I think I had three or four seeds in each one of them,|sd
and those things just flat took over.|sd
Um, it wasn't until late, I guess in the summer,|sd
maybe it was because it was too dry,|sd
they finally started making zucchini,|sd
and I'm not sure when a good time to plant those is, if they should be planted early or later.|sd
It seems like all I got was, -|sd
Supposedly after the soil warms up.|sd
I would think so, um,|aa
seems like these all, they all went to, uh, to leaf,|sd
and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit.|sd
So, I don't know if I, -|sd
Mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but I don't, I hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is.|sd
I, I doubt if zucchini is in there.|sd
It may not be,|aap_am
it may not be.|aap_am
Probably the same time the, the other squash is though.|sv
You think they're later in the year?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Uh.|%
About the same time that you plant okra because it's supposed to be warm.|sd
Well, that's true.|aa
Most of the okra that is growing around higher is, is, uh, later okra.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well that's about, um, -|sd
We decided this year, -|sd
Go ahead.|ad
I'm sorry,|fa
go ahead.|ad
Well, I was just going to say, it's a little over six or seven minutes.|sd
So whenever you feel comfortable about concluding, well, I'm, -|ad
that would be fine.|ad
Oh, just any time.|sd
Well, all right.|aa
I guess we'll call this one quits|sd
an, and thanks for participating.|ft
All right.|aa
Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.|fc
All right,|fc
have a good time.|fc
Okay.|fc
Bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
You said you have four cats?|qy^d
Yes,|ny
I have four cats.|sd
How old are they?|qw
Well they range from, let's see about a year and a half to nine years old.|sd
Oh gosh.|b
Yes.|b
I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years,|sd
I've had him probably five years.|sd
Oh okay,|bk
you get so attached to them.|sd
Oh yes,|aa
I love my cats.|sd
I lost one, one time, uh,|sd
Oh.|b
the first one I got.|sd
He jumped off the balcony actually, of a second story apartment.|sd
Oh no.|ba
And he'd never been outside, like, you know, by himself outside.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it started raining|sd
and I was hysterical.|sd
I was, I was, -|%
I mean, you would have thought a child had died.|sd
Yes,|b
uh-huh.|b
I called everyone I knew,|sd
I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat.|sd
Yes,|b
I understand.|ba
And they laughed at me,|sd
they thought that was so hysterical.|sd
Oh no,|ba
I understand,|ba
we, uh, we've gone through the same things with ours,|sd
we've had, you know, they've been ill,|sd
I mean I take off work,|sd
Oh yeah.|b
my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy.|sd
And then we had a baby|sd
and it's like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby.|sd
The cat was here first|bf
so I know,|sd
it's hard.|sv
And, and then when we go to sleep at night, you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.|sd
Oh, how funny.|ba
It's like all right, whose corners is this one.|sd
That's sweet,|ba
I have the two,|sd
the other two cats I have are outdoor cats.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
And they didn't used to be actually,|sd
but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside,|sd
so I put them outside once I got a house|sd
and they're doing great out there,|sd
they love it.|sd
But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
Other than that he gets scared to death.|sd
If you shut that door he goes into hiding.|sd
Oh no.|ba
I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony|sd
Yes,|aa
uh-huh,|aa
that's it|sv
And Lord knows what happened to him.|sd
He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.|sd
Right,|aa
traumatized for life here.|bf
Probably.|aap_am
Oh yeah,|b
we've, -|%
all four of ours are house cats.|sd
Are they.|bh
We started out with two, with two outdoor cats|sd
but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.|sd
Oh no.|ba
Oh well he lived through it,|sd
oh, I couldn't believe it.|sd
We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.|sd
Oh my gosh.|ba
The, the cat almost died,|sd
and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat,|sd
oh he loves life now.|sd
Oh, I imagine.|ba
And he's like oh, thank you so much.|sd
I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened.|sd
I know,|aa
we wondered about that.|sd
But, uh, oh that was a traumatic experience for us too.|sd
Oh, I can imagine,|ba
what did he shoot him with.|qw
Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun|sd
and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.|sd
Oh my gosh.|ba
People are crazy.|sv
Oh yes,|aa
absolutely nuts.|sv
But, uh, luckily enough, you know, we found the cat in time and, uh, rushed him to the vet|sd
and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery|sd
and,|%
Oh Lord.|ba
I mean he started off as a stray|sd
and then we did all this for him|sd
Oh man.|ba
But oh, he's been a wonderful cat.|sd
I imagine.|ba
They usually are after something like that happens to them.|sv
It seems to mellow them or something.|sv
Oh yes.|aa
But, uh, we wouldn't ha-, we wouldn't have them, -|sd
I mean, I don't see us without pets, without cats.|sd
No.|aa
There's just, uh, there's this, they just fill this void.|sd
Oh yeah,|aa
I ke-, I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I don't, I can't take care of them as well because they're outside,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back,|sd
Yes.|aa
and I feel like they need a big home, a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things.|sd
But I can't give them up.|sd
Oh no.|aa
I just, I go hysterical when they don't come home.|sd
Right|aa
and you worry about, oh, who's taking care of them.|bf
Oh, oh yeah,|aa
and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And you go crazy thinking it might be yours.|sd
Right,|aa
well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night.|sd
We, we-, I had one that had, we had, we had to put to sleep he got so sick.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, well I fell in love with this, uh, it's a Chinchilla Persian,|sd
Ugh!|ba
and oh, my husband just died.|sd
Really.|b
It was like we can't take it back|sd
you've got, we've got to keep it now.|^q
It's here now,|bf
we have to keep it.|bf
Yeah,|b
my, my first one that I got, -|sd
I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment.|sd
It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh,|b
yes.|b
So I found this one|sd
and, uh, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens.|sd
Oh uh-huh.|b
And I thought well that's interesting,|sd
I'll call them.|^q
Right.|b
And he was the only one left|sd
and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
And he was the last one she carried across, you know,|sd
the whole big sad story.|sd
Oh.|b
So of course, I had to take him.|sd
I felt so sorry for him after that.|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
And he is, uh, you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.|sd
Oh no.|ba
Yeah,|b
he, -|%
I asked the vet why he did that|sd
and he said he was probably weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed,|sd
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
But he is the lovingest cat.|sd
Everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him.|sd
Oh.|b
He never meows,|sd
he, he doesn't have any front claws,|sd
I had him declawed,|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
but he doesn't bite anybody|sd
he's just, he's just kind of there, real friendly and docile.|sd
Oh that's good.|ba
Oh we just, uh, just love them.|sd
They, uh, you know, get to feeling so lovey and dovey|sd
and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest|sd
and it's like oh, your claws need trimming.|sd
Oh yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
we do, we call that doing biscuits,|sd
Oh yes,|b
yes.|b
it looks like their kneading bread *spelling "their" should be "they're"|sd
Oh it just drives us nuts.|sd
Oh, I just love cats.|sd
I like dogs,|sd
they're okay,|sv
I had,|sd
Um, yeah.|b
but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually.|sv
They really are.|aa
The cats are so independent|sv
and they have so much more personality than a dog.|sv
Oh yeah,|aa
they do.|sv
And, but oh, they're so much fun to watch them play.|sv
Oh they are.|aa
I love it,|sd
it's so funny to get more than one cat together, because it brings out their personalities.|sv
Yes.|b
And they just act so funny.|sv
Oh, we've got, -|sd
well the two that were outside, they're like brothers,|sd
I mean I've never seen two cats so close.|sd
Really.|b
And, uh, they, uh, will get to playing chase through the house,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it is hysterical, I mean|sd
and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit.|sd
It's like this train.|sd
A train of cats running around.|bf
I mean it sounds like a train.|sd
We have wooden floors|sd
and so it just sort of echoes through the house|sd
Oh how funny,|ba
I can imagine.|ba
Yeah,|%
I wouldn't give anything for my cats.|sd
I love them to death.|sd
Oh no,|aa
they're just, they're, they're just, uh, they're wonderful, uh.|sv
What are your cats' names.|qw
Uh, we have, uh, Bonzo, Bear, Poindexter, and Felix.|sd
Oh, how sweet.|ba
And what do you have.|qw
I have Xanadu and Precious, and Rascal.|sd
Oh.|b
Precious and Rascal are brother and sister|sd

Nothing.|sd
Precious is a medium hair yellow cat,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b

Nothing.|b^m
They don't look a thing a like,|sd
Not a thing, goodness gracious.|ba

Is she the oldest one?|qy
Yeah,|ny
she's the oldest.|sd
And she, -|%
well in fact I got her when I moved out of the house also.|sd

Oh, goodness.|ba
You get so attached to them.|sv
Oh definitely.|aa
My mother has dogs|sd

This is nothing like cats.|sv
You can walk a dog|sd

Right,|aa
I'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person, no, it wouldn't have worked.|sd
It wouldn't have,|b^m

Oh that's one of the requirements I asked him.|sd
I said, now you do like cats, right.|sd
We don't li-, -|%
Have you seen those, uh, -|qy
do you ever read COSMO.|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
There was cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago|sd
and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date|sd
and there were cats hanging all over him. Hanging on his clothes, you know,|sd
they had ripped him up|sd
and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom|sd
he said, of course I love cats.|sd
And they were just all over him and sitting on his head, the whole nine yards.|sd
It was so funny.|sd
Oh yeah,|b
oh, the whole time I was pregnant they kept saying, are you getting rid of your cats,|sd
are you getting rid of your cats.|^q
You can't be pregnant and have cats.|^q
I'm like, uh, no, no, no.|sd
Watch me.|^q
Right,|aa
the child will learn to like cats.|^q

Well, what are your hobbies?|qw
Well, actually my hobbies now are T shirt making.|sd
I'm making T shirts and sweat shirts.|sd
In fact that's what I was doing when you called.|sd
Well, that sounds interesting.|sv
What kinds of, uh, sweat shirts and T shirts do you make?|qw
Um, right now I'm making Christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and --|sd
Okay.|b
Is that silk screening, or, -|qy
Um, no,|nn
I'm, have material that I cut out,|sd
and then you, um, -|sd
there's this stuff called Wonder Under that you un-, that you iron it on|sd
and then you iron that on the T shirt, and you paint around it.|sd
Oh, I see.|bk
So, it's real fun.|sd
I started doing it as a, um, just something fun to do,|sd
and now I'm selling them and pretty, -|sd
Well, how's it going?|qo
Pretty good.|sd
I just started last week,|sd

I guess in my spare time I'll be making T shirts|sd
So. -|%
Well, somebody has to do it,|sv
That's right, you know.|aa
Give you a little Christmas money, any way.|sv
That's correct.|aa
Well, what are your hobbies?|qw
Well, I, I kind of have hobby fads, I guess.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
When I was growing up I was, was into coin collecting,|sd
and that dropped off about the time I hit puberty, I guess,|sd
and then, my hobbies in high school went just to the sports.|sd
Now my latest one is classic cars.|sd
I've --|sd
Um.|b
Almost had it done,|sd
and I went on, went ahead and sold it.|sd
Oh, my gosh.|ba
But it was fun.|sd
I really enjoyed it.|sd
Well, how'd you learn to do that --|qw
Oh, you just, -|sd
You just get a book that tells you how to do it or what?|qy
No,|nn
you just kind of, -|sd
all I did is, uh, I bought the car|sd

I, uh, was just in a supermarket|sd

basically it, it was called MUSTANG MAGAZINE|sd

Uh-huh.|b
and they had, uh, some names, some companies that sold mustang parts,|sd
and I just started ordering some parts|sd
and, and, you know, basically, you know, I, what I did was, I redid the whole interior.|sd
I didn't do too much to the engine, because the engine was pretty good, but the, the whole interior and then part of the exterior,|sd
just kind of do it.|sd
Where'd you get the car?|qw
Well, we lived, we lived in South Dakota,|sd
and I bought it up there before I moved down here.|sd
Wow.|ba
So it was, it was kind of rusted out there,|sd
there isn't too much rust on any vehicles down here.|sd
Well, that's true,|aa
that's true.|aa
Well that sounds neat.|ba
Well, gee I guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies.|sv
Let's see.|^h
That, that about covers mine|sd
and T shirt making about covers yours.|sv
Well, let's see,|^h
I've done other hobbies.|sd
I'm a hobby person.|sd
I've always done a lot of craft stuff.|sd
I always have done needlepoint and cross stitch and all that,|sd
and, I collect dolls,|sd
I have a huge collection of dolls which is still in New Mexico with my parents|sd
In New Mexico?|br
Uh-huh,|aa
from New Mexico.|sd
Okay.|bk
So. Let's see,|^h
what else?|qh
I started collecting music boxes.|sd
I guess that's a hobby.|sd
Yeah|aa
that is.|sd
So. -|%
That's interesting.|ba
How many music boxes do you have?|qw
Probably o-, uh, about twenty.|sd
Do they all play different songs --|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
-- or do some of them play the same song?|qrr
They, they all play different songs.|sd
Well, that's neat.|ba
What's the most expensive one you bought?|qw
The most expensive.|b^m
I don't know.|sd
I've gotten all of them for gifts.|sd
I don't -- -|%
Oh, really.|b
-- bought a few of them.|sd
I usually get them for Christmas gifts or, and like when people go, you know, to, on trips or something.|sd
Well, that's interesting.|ba
It used to be tea spoons, was the thing.|sd
That's true|aa
I never collected those, never collected those.|sd
Well, that's interesting, music boxes.|ba
I have dolls from all over too.|sd
That I started when I was a little girl,|sd
and I have a lot of dolls.|sd
.|%
People would always bring them when they go to the countries,|sd
and, um, and I did that when I went to Europe one summer.|sd
I bought a doll everywhere we went|sd
so. -|%
Well how was Europe?|qo
economy.|sd
It was great,|sd
it was quick.|sd
I was in, I was in high school,|sd
and I was in a tour,|sd
and we went all, -|sd
it's kind of a, it's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries,|sd
and, um, it was called People to People,|sd
and we'd stay in people's homes,|sd
and then we got to also tour big cities,|sd
and I really enjoyed it.|sd
Was that in high school --|qy
Uh-huh --|ny
-- or was that a college thing?|qrr
-- in was in high school.|sd
So I'd like to go back, because we had, you know, -|sd
everything was rushed --|sd
I bet.|aa
-- everything was like an hour or two hours at the Louvre, you know, things like that where you need the whole day,|sd
but --|%
Right.|b
That's where a camcorder would come in handy.|sv
Exactly,|aa
that's true.|aa
Well that sounds real neat.|ba
So you, you haven't been back to Europe since then, huh?|qy
No,|nn
I always thought I would,|sd
but who knows now.|qh
I got married and, maybe some day.|sd
Maybe it's one of those retirement things|sd
There you go.|aa
Well, does you husband, uh, -|qy
what does he think of your, uh, T shirts and, -|qw
Well, he likes it all right.|sd
He's been pretty good, because there's T shirt stuff all over the house.|sd
Does he help out much|qy
or, -|%
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
we're supposed to talk about vacations.|sd
Right,|aa
so, uh, well, uh, what kind of vacations do you like?|qw
Well, uh, I haven't been to many places,|sd
but I have a opportunity to go to, uh, Paris, France, uh, with, uh, with my friend in April.|sd
She is, her, uh, her family, you know, lives there,|sd
and she's only been there once.|sd
Her grandmother lives there --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so I'm hoping to g-, I'm praying I get to go. Uh,|sd
Oh, that's great.|ba
Yeah,|aa
it's, it will be probably the most exciting place I'll ever get to go.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Have you ever been to, uh, like New Mexico?|qy
Uh, no, actually.|nn
Oh.|b
Why, have you?|qy
I was curious.|sd
I was just wondering what it was like.|sd
Oh, okay|bk
No, uh,|nn
I have been to Europe once and to Haiti and, uh, -|sd
Tahiti?|br
Yeah.|aa
Tahiti,|b
oh.|b
No,|ar
no,|ar
Haiti.|sd
Oh, Haiti.|b^m
Right.|aa
Where is that?|qw
It's, uh, well, it's in the Caribbean|sd
and it's the western half of an island,|sd
with the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country, most of them third world countries.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um.|%
So, yeah,|b
that turned out to be a really good experience for me.|sd
So, what did you do when you were in Europe?|qw
Uh, well, see, I went there when I was in high school, actually --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and, uh, hung out with them, worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp.|sd
What did you do on the farm?|qw
Uh, uh, uh, well, not that much|sd
Just, uh, -|%
Are you just kind of sight, just kind of, uh, -|qy
Right,|na
I mean, I wasn't a great asset to them or anything|sd
But I, you know, drove a tractor, helped them weed beets and that sort of thing.|sd
Um.|%
And, uh, yep,|b
and I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home|sd
and that was pretty interesting.|sd
And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were, uh, staying for their vacation in France in Nantes, which is on the west coast, like right across from England.|sd
Um.|%
Uh, so, uh, where in France are you,|qw
Paris.|sd
Right,|b
Paris.|b^m
Yeah.|b
And, uh, um, how long do you plan to be going for?|qw
Uh, two weeks.|sd
Last time she stayed two months,|sd
but we're only going to stay two weeks.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
Great.|ba
And, uh, -|%
We're going to take a cooking class there,|sd
so that might be fun.|sd
A what?|br
Cooking class, you know,|sd
French cooking.|sd
Oh, great.|ba
Yeah.|b
And, uh, what else are you planning to do, if anything?|qw
Museums, you know,|sd
go to museums and, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah, um,|b
Do you go to museums in Europe?|qy
Uh, actually, no,|nn
I don't think I went to any of them.|sd
Uh, the closest thing I did was go to some like, uh, restored castles and stuff.|sd
Um.|%
That, there is some on that west coast of France|sd
and I went to a vineyard or two in Germany.|sd
Um, that's neat.|ba
Yeah,|aa
that was nice.|sd
Uh, um, but, so, uh, -|%
Hey,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
what about, -|qo
have you ever been to Hawaii?|qy
Uh, no,|nn
I haven't.|sd
No?|bh
Have you?|qy
No.|nn
Okay|bk
Well, uh, well, -|%
I'm wanting to go there.|sd
Where have you gone first?|qw
Oh, g-, where have I gone that's anywhere.|qh
Yeah,|b
I mean, -|%
Uh,|%
All right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
well. -|%
Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it --|sv
Right.|b
Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?|qy
Uh, the short term, the recession is getting, getting top attention.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I, I think that you're absolutely right there.|sv
The other thing is, is that we've got these, um, these, all these bank defaults going on, and, and savings and loan defaults, and, and, uh, uh, -|sd
And that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not.|sv
Right.|aa
Exactly. Um,|aa
And that's got to be paid.|sv
Exactly,|aa
and, and, uh, so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come.|sv
Um, I'm not really, uh, sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing, for instance, tax reductions, because it seems to me that if, if, if they're talking about reducing, uh, the tax that needs to be paid, or the tax that's currently being paid, then that can't, it seems to me it can't possibly, you know, help with the, the deficit picture.|sd
It can only hurt the deficit picture.|sv
Yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
Um, and the, the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without, uh, bringing on, on serious problems for the longer term.|sv
Yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
So that, that, that's the current predicament.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it see-, seems like it's, it's a kind of a Catch Twenty-two.|sv
I mean, it's, it's the, um, -|%
my understanding is what they're try-, what, what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy, the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes, they'll have more money to spend, uh,|sd
and if they have more money to spend, then that will be a spur to productivity, particularly commercial productivity, uh, which in turn will generate revenue.|sd
But it, it seems like, like, uh, it's sort of a, uh, a sp-, an unending spiral,|sv
and it, it, it, uh, -|%
I'm, I'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the, uh, the idea that, that, uh, that decreasing taxes, particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to, uh, result in substantial amounts of money, you know, for consumers to spend.|sd
And, uh, -|%
Yeah,|aa
I'm not sure how I feel about paying on the quest, the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point.|sd
It's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it, uh, it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do.|sv
Well, well, first of all you look to the Fed to fight the recession --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|aa
I think that's been a positive development.|sv
I think what that's done is it's, it's, it's help keep inflation from, um, uh, -|sv
Well, at the moment we're doing very well on inflation.|sv
Yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
That's the sort of upside to the deficit.|sv
It's a sort of a piece of luck.|sv
That's the upside to the recession.|sv
Yeah, um.|b
I don't know,|h
what kind of things do you think can be done in, in, uh, in the long term?|qw
Well, can be done or will be done are two different things.|sv
Um, at various places to look for, for cutting the budget, first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned --|sd
Sure.|b
But there are various other areas such as, as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed.|sv
Uh, a lot of entitlement programs, like education aid, I think, uh, they should put a, in -|sv
the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
in the longer term, uh, we, we, we'd do well, I think to make, to make, uh, reductions there.|sv
Also somewhat is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed.|sv
Right.|aa
I think that, I think that, that I agree with you certainly in the second situation,|sd
and I think certain entitlements I, I'm inclined to agree with you, too.|sd
Education happens to be one place where I think that we would foolish to um, uh, -|sv
A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but schools that teach you trades, you know, beautician --|sd
Oh, I see, I see what you're saying.|bk
And then they --|sv
-- and then they don't provide very much education.|^2
Yes.|b
Well, I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that, uh, around, uh,|sd
and I, I, I can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing,|sd
but, but taking what you're saying at face value, then I would have to agree with completely.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well I guess we're, uh, forced to finally, to do a lot about air pollution.|sv
I hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars|sd
and low polluting fuels are being experimented with Ethanol and other types of fuels.|sd
Yeah,|b
one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from?|sd
I, you know, I assume,|sd
That's what,|aa
But I,|sd
I just know that, um, acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from, would -|sd
comes over the border from us.|sd
Right.|aa
Yeah,|aa
I think the automobile definitely is an area and any, any industry that burns, you know,|sv
and then I don't know about chemical pollution.|sd
I'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air.|sd
I know we have a lot of chemical, the indoor type pollution.|sd
They have offices that are too well insulated.|sd
They found people are getting sick,|sd
Yeah.|b
but I don't know if that affects outside.|sd
You know, I, I think, seems to think, seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside|sd
and the thing I can, the only thing I can think of would be cars and factories.|sd
Yeah,|aa
the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes.|bf
Yeah.|aa
Um, I guess there's been a lot of pressure to, um, do away with the C F C's in these spray bottles which,|sd
Right.|b
Yeah,|aa
that is, well that's destroying the ozone, isn't it?|qy
Again I, that's what I hear|na
and, and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone, there's a hole in the ozone or not|sd
but at last I heard it was, uh, discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought,|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's wh-, -|%
It's kind of scary.|sv
Well, it is scary|aa
and I think it will, uh, continue to force us to clean up our act,|sv
Yeah.|b
We've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment.|sv
I think something too that you probably see in older states, all we, we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces.|sv
I, I, I'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't,|sd
I think it will.|sv
In Los Angeles they're apparently going to, -|sd
they've passed laws that, for habit, do you think this could possibly be prohibit? nothing elseseems to make any sense?? for example, people using, uh, barbecues -- *listen for habit prohibit|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles,|sd
and,|sd
Right.|b
and, and, uh, it's not too bad around here although you see it, you know, more and more in the sky.|sd
And people in this country are really wedded to their, uh, cars,|sv
Right.|b
and our economy seems to, -|sv
and this I think is one of the big problems,|sv
Yeah.|aa
In this area too since, you know, in Texas we're so spread out,|sd
Yeah.|b
we have to drive so far,|sd
but I know in Colorado I have witnessed that where it just, uh, it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts,|sd
but we're even getting it here.|sd
We can drive into, when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas|sd
and you can tell it in the mornings too.|sd
My husband likes to go out and jog|sd
and there's just a brown fog here|sd
and we don't even have any mountains that are,|sd
Yeah.|b
But they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together, the worse it gets.|sd
Well that makes a lot of sense.|sv
I mean I, I hadn't thought about it that way|sd
but it, it, -|%
You don't have to have mountains that are stopping it.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, they make, uh, making more and more high-rise buildings|sd
and, uh, so yeah,|%
we can comment|sv
and we didn't see this a few years ago.|sd
No,|aa
and I think, -|%
It was pretty clear here.|sd
Yeah,|b
and I think that, that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth, which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it, is a, is an organism of sorts,|sv
Right.|b
and, uh, we're going to feel it,|sv
and I think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
and in this country, uh, the, the solution that, that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable.|sv
For example,|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, I have a little sports car that I enjoy using|sd
and I know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive|sd
but I think, uh, we're going to have to make some fundamental changes|sv
and, and I'm, I'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and,|sd
Yeah.|b
And it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car, just one person in that.|sv
It's a lot of waste|sv
but, -|%
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
The topic is to discuss the, uh, sources where I receive news.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, for me that's mostly newspaper and radio,|sd
I almost never watch television, as a matter of course|sd
so, I don't get news from television,|sd
except during the war,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, why was C N N the only, -|qw
of course I think, Saddam Hussein only allowed C N N to broadcast it,|sv
is that not true?|qy
Um.|%
It was unusual not to have the different sources, you know, of news coverage.|sv
Yeah.|b
Um, I don't know.|h
I guess, uh, I don't even know why I watched C N N.|sd
I guess, I just wanted more news.|sd
It's one of the few times I wanted more news than. -|sd

well, I know even if you watched A B C, N B C or the other,|sd

C B S.|b^m

Were they?|qy
Uh-uh.|nn
Yeah.|b
That's the only thing they broadcast|sd
and like you I listened to radio on my job at work.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And all this week they have been having this, uh, a discussion about that is why, uh, why C N N was -|sd
well, I listen to a Christian radio station.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they were saying that C N N is definitely a world, uh, news service|sd
and, uh, they, -|%
it was, -|%
you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got, you know.|sv
Huh.|%
Uh, we had some, uh, some people from our church went to Israel, uh, just for a, uh, tour sort of thing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I was watching on TV|sd
they, they broadcast this terrible riot|sd
supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem,|sd
Right.|b
and so it really made me question as to what, how do we know, you know, uh, if the news we're getting is any good.|sd
So -|%
Yeah,|aa
I guess, the news just focuses on major events that probably,|sv
Yeah.|b
Right,|aa
right.|aa
But, uh, I, I'm from California|sd
and I can remember being in, uh, in these earthquakes|sd
and, I mean they were,|sd
Yeah.|b
but they get all blown up in the news. Um,|sd
Uh-huh|b
Well I, I find it depressing to watch our, -|sd
specially TV, you know, -|sd
it's just, uh, -|%
local news concentrates, on murders and things like that.|sd
I'm from Dallas|sd
and, uh, we have a lot of bad stuff, uh,|sd
it just really gets me depressed,|sd
Uh-huh.|b

you don't even, even know about it.|sv

Huh?|br
They just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the TV, you know t-, uh, selections of the day.|sd

I don't know,|no

because it was, you know, took a couple tries before I found somebody.|sd

Um, uh, I mean, the first thing is, the uh, if it's going to be mandatory, it's got to be mandatory,|sv
I mean, everybody, not just like, you know, poor people and all that, you know. But,|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
I mean, everybody's got to do it.|sv
Um, I don't know,|h
it'd probably be, it'd probably be good,|sv
I just don't know if, you know, I was eighteen or whatever, I'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever.|sd
I'm not sure I want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision.|sd
Uh, I mean, that, that doesn't sound right.|sv
Um, I guess I see overall beneficial, if, if we're going from that point of view.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um. I-, you know, in the past, -|%
I don't know, I don't know how old you are,|sd
but when I was, uh, in high school, it was the beginning of Vietnam and so forth.|sd
And many of my peers were being drafted.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever.|sd
But I, I felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone, or go into a military situation, that they could help the country in other ways. Be it cleaning out, uh, lots, in, in their neighborhood or,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I guess I see that as, as not so much a demand but, but a privilege.|sd
It's, it's kind of, uh, uh,|sv
It is, uh,|aa
it's, it's -|%
since we live here and we all benefit, rich, poor or in between, uh, there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest. I just see that as maybe a good idea.|sv
I wouldn't mind doing it at forty-four.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, and I find ways to, to turn some of that back to, to others.|sd
Uh, and I, I guess I, I can't see that as being something to really object to.|sd
Well, I guess it would still depend on how,|sv
I mean, if, if you're talking about any-, if you're talking about something that's like a full time, you know, one year full time, you know, this is what you do, you know.|sv
You're going to go and, and fill pot holes and, you know, and, you know, all that stuff.|^q

it was needed,|sv

and also, you know, you, you feel more like, you know, you're actually part of the community if you've done something,|sv
That's right.|aa
You take pride in that, and, and get some, some positive feedback from those who benefit,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And I, I see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or, or at least the area where the person lives.|sd
Uh, definitely.|aa
It might not be the same neighborhood, but the same city or county, because then you're, you're coming in contact with it.|sv
It's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that I'll never be able to see again, unless I happen to go on vacation,|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
It's, it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual, on going.|sv
Yeah.|b
But as far as putting that into work, I don't want to, I don't want to deal with the, with the heartache of, first of all, getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics,|sd
Oh, that would,|sv
And just, I mean, just getting, getting it going.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
I, I, see a lot of things like, uh, scouting, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- And I guess, I don't see, uh, this being that different. But even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh|b
Yeah.|b
Do you have kids?|qy
N-, no,|nn
not yet|sd
In about six months we will|sd
Oh, well good.|ba
Th-, you'll have a little time think about that.|sv
I guess, I, I have, uh, -|%
when I was teaching school I saw many, so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose.|sd
And I can see, you know, some, some really significant things coming out of it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I know you've got to get past that, that grudge attitude that many have,|sd
but that's, uh, tha-, that would be a part of selling it to the community.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I may, -|%
well I don't know,|h
around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for.|sd
Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will, uh, police a, uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee-, -|sd
and I, I've seen it in other states too.|sd
Yeah.|b
They have,|sd
I don't know,|h
um,|%
they've got, um, in most of the states around here I think, uh. -|sd
You know, down in North Carolina, there was a big controversy for a while, because they, uh, the local chapter of the K K K wanted to, uh,|sd
and, uh,|sd
and there were those that said, No,|^2
you can't do that, I'm sure.|^q
Well, uh, it was, it was interesting because that's an interesting question, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
Should these people be allowed to or not?|^q
I think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed|sd
Oh.|b
And I hadn't even thought about that, uh, the, the other end of that.|sd
That, that's an interesting, uh, situation.|sv
I hadn't thought of that.|sd
We had visited relatives in Virginia, not too long ago,|sd
and I thought I had seen, when we were traveling around the state, some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up|sd
and, -|%
Yeah.|aa
I think Virginia's got it|sd
and I know Maryland does,|sd
and we just, we went to Indianapolis last weekend, and back.|sd
And, um, I'm pretty sure I saw, yeah, stuff in Ohio and Indi-, Indiana about it and Pennsylvania, maybe Pennsylvania,|sd
I don't remember for sure now.|sd
And I don't know about your part of the country,|h
but, uh, down here in the last, oh, year plus, I, it was las-, beginning with last year's Earth Day --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and e-, I work for Texas Instruments.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they, they've started some recycling campaigns that a year before that had been turned down because they said, Well, it's not feasible,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
it's not a good idea.|^q
And,|sd
Yeah.|aa
And but then they lost,|sd
It's just, thing, a part of everyone's consciousness.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, the thing about that is though, it's got a, -|sv
I mean because it was, I mean it was big, you remember, like in the early seventies and all that.|sd
And, you know, and then it kind of just went out of vogue.|sd
And I, I'm worried that it, it might, you know, it'll, it, the same thing will happen.|sd
It's like, you know, environmentalism was really big for a couple of years|sd
and then people like, well, you know, -|%
I'd ruther, rather spend, you know, fifty cents less on, uh, on, on such and such, you know,|^q
and even if it's not environmentally safe, who cares, you know.|^q
I'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way.|sv
Uh, there have been too many other things that it's done that for, just in my life.|sv
And if you look at history at all, you see that, you know, uh, we go from one side to the other on just about any subject,|sv
Yeah.|b
But, it is comforting to me to see, uh, more concern about some of these things that, that cost us money.|sd
Especially when we have dwindling, uh, resources such as oil that's burning out of control in the Persian Gulf, and, and so forth.|sd
Just, just every little bit does,|sd
it makes me feel better.|sd
It, it makes me feel like, well, there may be something left for my children, my nieces and nephews and so forth.|sd
Well, yeah, uh.|b
Well, uh, wouldn't, -|%
it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may, may, make some people realize that hey, you know, this stuff runs out.|sv
That's, that's right, because, -|aa
Of course, that's probably blasphemy for you to say, uh, coming from where you are in Texas.|sv
Uh, no,|ar
no,|ar
because if, we, -|%
what was it, seventy-four when we had the, the last last oil crisis?|qh
And, uh, we started getting smart|sv
and, and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And as soon as the oil prices came back down, we, the pendulum swang the other way.|sd
Right.|b
And we need those reminders.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh, or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say, Oh, my goodness, now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology.|sv
Right.|aa
Well, my dad's in the, in the solar energy business,|sd
so, uh,|sd
Ah!|ba
But, you know, on the other hand, he voted for George Bush,|sd
so um, you know, I, I wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing.|sd
Well, I thi-, you know, -|%
just about anybody you could name, whether I voted for them or not,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But that's why they're there and not me.|sd
I don't want the,|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, the, the thing with Bush ... -|sv
Okay, uh,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I was just trying to think about how I, how I dress for work, you know,|sd
T I is a very casual atmosphere.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, what I usually do on the weekend is, is lay out five outfits|sd
and, uh, on Monday I, I wear the, the worst looking one|sd
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
And then progressively through the week, I'll, I'll wear nicer looking things|sd
and then on Friday most everybody wears jeans, jeans and sweatshirts, or, you know, jeans and blouses or something like that.|sd
Uh, but mostly what I wear are skirts and blouses or, you know, skirts and, uh, pullover sweaters or, uh, you know, little two piece dress suit, suits like,|sd
but. -|%
Yeah, uh,|b
you know, that's a good way to approach it.|sv
I've never thought about, um, -|sd
I do plan my clothes a week in advance.|sd
Actually, I plan them a month in advance.|sd
I usually do a month at a time,|sd
so I don't repeat an outfit.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, um, I've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday, because really no one's paying attention.|sd
But anyway, um, I really, I don't work outside of school.|sd
Um, I work in the computer lab at school|sd
so I can just wear whatever I have on for school,|sd
an, and, um, and really it's, -|%
I try to dre-, dress presentable but very comfortable.|sd
Right.|b
Like, um, in the warm weather it's always shorts and a t-shirt or a button up or something like that|sd
and then in the winter time it's jeans or, or pants.|sd
I usually, uh, you know, -|%
college is so casual,|sv
you really don't want to dress up unless you, you, uh, have a job|sv
and you have to be there right after school or something like that,|sv
so. -|%
Right.|aa
Like where I work, it's, it's pretty casual, uh,|sd
it's, it's, I guess it's more like a, a college campus|sd
also, I mean there's hundre-, you know, hundreds of people work for T I.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, a lot of people just, just wear jeans and, and, uh, sweats all the time|sd
and they dress up like when customers are coming in,|sd
And, uh, you know, a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their, the real, uh, higher ups,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
So there's a good combination in the hallways all the time, you know|sd
Well that's good that they're so casual.|sv
Yeah.|b
I mean, uh, my brother works for T I|sd
and he's a computer programmer, or computer engineer.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And, uh, you know, whenever he was going to school, he was expecting to having to wear, uh, a tie or a dress shirt everyday.|sd
But, uh, he goes to work in his blue jeans, t-shirt,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and he just loves it.|sd
And that's very acceptable at T I.|sv
Yeah.|b
I believe at I B M they, they make you wear a blue suit and, uh, some kind of colored shirt and a tie.|sd
That's what I've heard.|aa
Uh-huh,|b
I wo-, I would hate to be in that atmosphere.|sd
But, uh, I mean, they, they just moved into the new building,|sd
he calls it the new building.|sd
I don't know,|h
it's where all the executives are.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, um, and so they were, they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the, all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans.|sd
But, he just left for Italy today at four,|sd
Oh.|b
and he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them.|sd
I see.|bk
Over in T, I mean for T I but over in Italy.|sd
Yeah,|b
oh, T I is everywhere.|sd
Oh, yeah,|aa
he was so excited about going.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, he didn't carry any ties or anything because he, he just went over there with the that attitude, well if I don't take it then they won't make me wear it|sd
That's true,|aa
that's a good idea.|sv
Because, uh, he just, he didn't, you know, -|sd
he's not really into all that.|sd
He would wear it if he had to for his job and all|sd
but, you know, if he had the preference, I mean his, his preference is, um, blue jeans and a t-shirt,|sd
so. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
But I think that's great about T I,|sv
and also, uh, to get off the clothing, the smokers, you know, how they have the,|sd
The, -|%
no,|%
Right.|b
I think that's great.|sv
Yeah,|aa
and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke, smoke area and you don't smoke, you almost strangle.|sd
Oh, really.|b
Do you smoke?|qy
So much smoke in the air.|sd
Yeah,|ny
areas, the smoking area, you know, it's closed in,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and if you don-, if you don't smoke and you go in there, -|sd
tha-, everybody that goes in there smokes|sd
so it's full of smoke when, when you go in there.|sd
I used to smoke a long time ago.|sd
I think that's, um, -|sv
I used to burn my clothes, talking about getting back to clothes|sd
I used to burn my clothes with cigarettes.|sd
That's one of the reason that I stopped|sd
Well, um, y-, you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college.|sd
Well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions|qy
and, uh? -|%
Yeah,|ny
she always had, uh, yeah, she always had to have a lot of clothes.|sd
See that's how, that's how I am|sd
but my mamma was not raised like that|sd
and so, -|%
No,|aa
I, I wasn't either,|sd
she, my daughter, she's real good at finding sales though, you know.|sd
Oh, me to,|sd
boy I have --|sd
Sh-, she'll buy a lot of,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And she, you know, she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and, uh, buys clothes.|sd
Uh, whe-, you know, when they were coming up, I, I didn't sew,|sd
but now I've, I've learned how to sew,|sd
so I'm, well I'm, I'm still learning how,|sd
but I'm ge-, and I'm getting much better at it|sd
and I,|sd
That's great.|ba
I wanted to take a sewing class at school|sd
but I just haven't fit it into my schedule yet,|sd
but that, I mean, that can really benefit.|sv
Right.|b
Um, that's something that I'd be very interested in, very interested in learning.|sd
Right,|aa
because clothes are s-, are really expensive.|sv
Uh, they're outrageous!|sv
uh, uh, a little simple shell, shell blouse, you know, that you can make for about, say ten dollars at, you know, at, at the most out of a decent fabric,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah it's,|sv
Just a little shell to go under a suit, you know.|sd
It is, it is really outrageous|sv
but, uh, I mean like whenever I, I was growing up and all, my mom, -|sd
I never understood this then,|sd
but I do now,|sd
but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars,|sd
or,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and she always told me it was because I was still growing|sd
and she wasn't going to buy me something I was going to grow out of next week.|sd
Right,|aa
especially to pay that kind of money for it.|bf
Yeah.|aa
I have a friend who, uh, -|sd
she had a, she had a ba-, a little boy|sd
and, uh, she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus.|sd
I mean,|sd
Oh no|ba
And then, seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And she finally learned that you just can not do this, you know. *can not cannot|sd
So now she finds the basement sales and, just like, you know, everybody else.|sd
That's the best way to shop.|sv
I mean, I always thought my mom was being mean to me|sd
but I look back at it now|sd
and my child is going to, -|sd
I mean, I'm going to raise mine the same way.|sd
Right.|b
Um, I don't know,|h
I just, they're just so outrageously priced,|sv
it's just incredible.|sv
Yes,|aa
and you, -|%
I try to, uh, always catch the sales.|sd
Right.|b
Always|sd
And, yeah,|b
and you just have to keep buying them, you know.|sv
If you, if you, if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the, the quality is really not that great, you know, for the price that you pay.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it, it depends on, um, -|sv
yeah,|%
there's, there's always a reason why they're on sale|sv
Right.|b
So that, that has a lot to do with it.|sv
Right.|b
But, um, -|%
well, -|%
Like I bought, I bought the most beautiful swe-, uh, sweater from, uh, I believe it was Ross Dress For Less|sd
Uh.|%
And it wa-, it was really pretty,|sd
it was just, you know, it was just plain, a plain, uh, ro-, you know, round, uh, necked, uh, sw-, sweater.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it had, like, it was embellished around the, the top, you know,|sd
it had, uh, leather, leather designs and, um, some other, other little things on it|sd
and I just thought it was so pretty|sd
and I go-, I got it at a real good price,|sd
I think maybe it was nine ninety-nine or something.|sd
Oh, that's great.|ba
And it was so pretty,|sd
and after I wore it a couple of times I realized why, why it was,|sd
Uh, oh.|ba
There was, in the middle of the back of it, there was, -|sd
it's like there, -|sd
it had been slit|sd
and they had like just sewed it back together,|sd
Oh, no.|ba
wasn't a seam or anything, you know.|sd
Uh-huh|b
And that's why it was so cheap, although, it's not, it's not really noticeable, like she was moving the uh, from the outside,|sd
but,|sd
And then I was told by somebody that works for J C Penney's that, uh, Ross, Ross is just one of those places that sell, sells seconds.|sd
The defect.|bf
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
um, they don't really buy the first quality,|sd
they buy the second.|sd
And, uh, places like J C Penney's that they'll reject the seconds,|sd
they'll send them back every time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But places like Ross Dress For Less and, uh, T J Max. -|sd
T J Max does that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
yeah|b
we have a T J Max over here|sd
and, um, -|%
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
what do you think about it?|qo
Well, uh, the roles have definitely changed --|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
Um, I think a lot of it has to do with women working.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
yeah,|aa
I do too.|sd
I think it's going to, -|sv
in, like in the future, I think all women are going to work.|sv
Yeah.|b
I mean, they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby,|sv
but that will be it,|sv
Yeah.|b
or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just, you know, just continue right on with your work.|sv
Ye-, yeah.|b
I mean, i-, it really is coming to that because most women now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
They can't even afford to take off, you know, to have children it seems like.|sv
And it, and it seems, if you're going to have kids, uh, that you are, you know, society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it.|sv
Yeah.|b
And, uh, because if you have, you know, two, well, if you go to work, you're, just working to pay for day care,|sv
Right.|b
Now, I was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were, you know, when I had them and when they were small,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, that is good.|ba
I mean I didn't work,|sd
I, I needed to|sd
but I didn't.|sd
Yeah,|b
Steve's, Steve has a sister who has four.|sd
She just had her fourth one in, uh, March|sd
and she doesn't have to work either.|sd
I don't know how they do it.|sd
I don-, I don't know how people do it with one,|sd
you know, um obviousl-, -|%
Let me tell you, you go without a lot of things that you wo-, you know. -|sd
yeah,|b
obviously we don't have any|sd
and, and I don't, I think that's part of the role reversal, is it's okay to get married and not have kids.|sv
Oh yeah.|b
And I think for society for such a long time said, well, you know, you're married, now you need to sa-, have, have your family|sv
and I don't think it's been until recently that, that they had decided that two people was a family.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
You know and, -|%
Well it's getting where you can't hardly afford, if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two.|sv
Right.|b
And I mean it's hard with two,|sv
now, we, -|%
uh, my youngest one, -|sd
I have two,|sd
I have a son and a daughter,|sd
and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon,|sd
Oh!|ba
and if I had a third one,|sd
Yea-,|b
Yeah.|b
Because I work now,|sd
I work full time|sd
and, uh, you know, it, -|%
when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got.|sv
Yeah.|b
They get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that,|sd
that helps out,|sv
but still, it cost a lot.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
I mean, just the, you know, the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and stuff.|sd
Right,|aa
and cars and all their books, -|sd
and the books are outrageous.|sv
Oh, I know,|aa
I know.|aa
and they're getting worse.|sv
Uh, my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for her, one of her next classes|sd
and it was like ninety-six dollars.|sd
Gee|ba
And this book is a little bitty skinny book.|sd
Yeah.|b
I said my goodness, what is it, lined in gold, you know, uh.|sd
Yeah.|b
But it is, it's getting worse,|sv
and, if I'd of probably had three or four children, I don't see how we could have made it, you know, without me working.|sd
But that's, that's probably because, you know, if you had three, you, you know, would say, if I'd of had four.|sv
I guess it's always not, not being able to picture one more,|sv
but in essence you probably would have worked out fine.|sv
Right,|aa
but I think I would have had to work.|sd
Yeah.|b
If I'd of had that many, I'd of had to work in order for my kids to, -|sd
you know, even though he brings in a real good living and everything, in order for me to keep up, I would have had to work.|sd
Yeah.|b
But I think it's getting more and more like,|sv
then you go to work|sv
and you work,|sv
Yeah.|b
because if you have two or three kids, by the, e-, way the inflation's going I think a woman's always going to have to work|sv
and it's just going to be an accepted thing.|sv
There isn't going to be any of this, you know, very few people will ever stay home.|sv
Yeah,|aa
and, and that's all right with me, because I don't want to stay home --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- you know, I think I'm just part of tha-, the new stuff, that is just, -|sd
I don't know, I think I would just go nuts sitting at home all day long.|sd
Well you know, I can't imagine how I did, because now I work all the time,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, um, well I work all week,|sd
and, um, I can't imagine how I stayed home.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, I think to myself, what did I do.|sd
And I think it just, it revolutionized an, where a woman thinks that a way, you know, just like, -|sv
now my daughter, there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now|sd
To her everything is, you've got to go through college, you've got to get a job, you know.|sd
And then when everything's set up, then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with,|sd
but.|sd
Right.|b
where, now when I graduated high school,|sd
That's, you did, that's what you did.|^2
uh-huh,|aa
and then you got married|sd
and then you had a family.|sd
I mean that's just the way it was, you know.|sd
Yeah|b
And, uh, that's like when my mo-, -|sd
I know when my mother's age it was always the kids and the family and everything had to come first|sd
and the woman stayed home and took care of them,|sd
an. -|%
I, uh, I, I like the way it is.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's, uh, being, -|%
see, we're from Houston and so it's not so hard for people,|sd
you know, you've been married three or so years|sd
and you don't have kids, well it's okay, no-, nobody does.|sd
But you come to a place like Belton,|sd
and th-, -|%
a lot of the kids here get married out of high school.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's real small town,|sd
and i-, -|%
and a lot of people in our su-, -|sd
we're the only couple in our Sunday School class, except for one other couple, who are in their forties,|sd
and they can't have children, who don't have children.|sd
And they can't imagine why we would want to have children. * I think the word might be "wouldn't", otherwise it doesn't make sense.|sd
And, I'm going well, you know, there's more to life, you know, there's life in there that's, -|sd
you know, not everybody has to have kids,|^q
and, I'd rather spend the time with my husband than, you know, spending time, -|^q
here, it's your turn, you know.|^q
Yeah,|b
but, you know, that, now even -|%
whenever I was coming up and everything -|sd
and we got married right out of high school, well a year after I got out of high school|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, I didn't have kids for four and a half years|sd
but that was because I wanted to work|sd
and I wasn't ready for kids.|sd
Yeah,|b
I think that's what it is,|sd
I'm not either.|sd
And, everybody thought, oh, my gosh, what is the matter with her, you know.|sd
They're probably going, oh, I bet she can't get pregnant|sd
Right,|aa
I mean they thought that it was terrible, you know,|sd
and then when I'd tell them, you know, well I'm just not ready for children yet,|sd
oh, but that, you know, you better, you better just get ready now. -|^q
Yeah.|b
Well you don't just get ready.|sv
But I was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time, they had kids within a year.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I just was not ready for kids.|sd
I wanted to get out and work a little bit|sd
and I wanted to travel and stuff like that, which we did.|sd
And, uh, kids didn't fit in right then,|sd
but, it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples|sv
and, really, if you don't want the kids, then it's not the time to have, -|sv
I don't care what anybody tells you.|sd
Right.|b
And I think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way.|sv
Because that's like my daughter|sd
now, she says that, you know, maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, even though I'd like to have grandchildren, I can see her point.|sd
Yeah,|b
Steve's mom finally, uh, finally s-, you know, said that, that God will take care of us when it's our time.|sd
Right.|b
She finally admitted, you know, she finally told me it's okay if you don't,|sd
but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very, very old fashioned family.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, she stayed home and raised her kids|sd
and, and she expected all of her kids to do that too,|sd
and their wives and to be the, the housewife and have dinner ready by five and, and, you know, be there at every beck and call -|sd
and, I was raised totally opposite|sd
How we got together, I don't know,|sd
but. Because my mother had six girls,|sd
and, you know, she worked too.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, I guess I just -|sd
and I saw how life was when she stayed home|sd
and it was rough,|sd
it was hard,|sd
and, uh. -|%
Yeah,|b
and it really is,|sv
I know,|sd
just like now, you know, there's, there's so much more now.|sd
All my income goes for things like luxuries,|sd
I mean, it really does.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But the rest of it -|sd
we just buy things like boats,|sd
or we go on trips, or, you know, just --|sd
Right.|b
but. -|%
Yeah,|b
I think you've, you've earned that though.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I feel like I have, you know, because well, we're just a age now,|sd
I'm not old|sd
but, I'm older.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I got to stay home with my kids, which I really wanted to do,|sd
but now I could not go back and do it.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I mean, I did stuff|sd
but,|sd
Right.|b
And I think it's just the new way that people are thinking.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I think so.|sv
But, uh, -|%
I think it would be neat if, if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you.|sv
Well you know more and more of them are,|sd
I don't know if it is up there where you are|sd
but where I am, the, just like all the hospitals,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Are they?|bh
But the reason they had to do this was because so many people, you know, so many women could not afford, -|sd
like you said if you had four kids, or even if you had two kids, you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go.|sd
Right.|b
So, uh, more and more of our hospitals, especially, over here are getting them|sd
and then some of the bigger companies, -|sd
but it's mainly the hospitals.|sd
Yeah,|b
I don't know if the T I in Dallas does or not.|sd
I know, I know nobody around here does, it,|sd
we're, it's too small around here.|sd
Oh really.|bh
Yeah.|ny
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
is it Mike?|qy
Yes.|ny
Do you repair your own car?|qy
I try to, whenever I can.|na
I've always been a, a I guess a product of a handyman father.|sd
Well, I tell you what, that's, y-, count your blessings because --|sv
Th-, -|%
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
There's, -|%
a-, although I'll tell you, you know, over the years the cars get more complicated.|sv
Well, that's why I don't do as much as I'd like.|sd
Right,|b
yeah.|b
Because they are, I mean they've got, they've gotten complicated haven't they?|qy
Yes.|ny
One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Is that right?|bh
Yeah.|ny
It, it got to be pretty straightforward to understand|sd
and, now since then, you know, the closer a car is to a fifty-six Buick, the, the more I know about it.|sd
And then start getting into these Nissans and the like -|sd
and I just can't keep up.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I, I agree.|aa
About all I ever, -|sd
I never was too mechanically inclined,|sd
but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and, -|sd
Yeah.|b
Course, they don't use, uh, points anymore.|sd
That's right|aa
But,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
And, uh, now brakes, I've always done a lot of, you know, changing brakes.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I used to do, I could always do the alternator, you know, and starter.|sd
Yes.|b
I don't anymore,|sd
but I have on a lot, a lot of times.|sd
Yes,|b
I understand.|ba
My last car repair actually had to do with brakes|sd
and it's one I did not do myself.|sd
I took the car, my, -|sd
I have a seventy-nine El Dorado, took it to be inspected --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and the parking brake failed.|sd
So I got under there and messed with the, the ten-, that, uh, that adjustment --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then I got there and tried to, -|sd
It probably slipped loose, didn't it?|qy
Well, actually that wasn't even eventually the problem.|arp_nd
I, I did a lot of things that I, I did everything that I could think to do.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, eventually I brought it up to a, a place called Just Brakes --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and it turns out that there's a, -|sd
the parking brake i-, in the rear, -|sd
there's a, there's disc brakes|sd
and the parking brake is a piston deal.|sd
Um.|%
And because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years, the piston froze up.|sd
Oh.|%
So they ended up having to pound it out.|sd
And one of them, they,|sd
and the other one they just, it was just frozen solid,|sd
so I ended up having to buy one|sd
and altog-, all total, it was just under two hundred dollars, believe it or not, to get all that done|sd
Y-, -|%
well, it really wasn't quite, s-, as bad as you thought, was it, was it?|qy
Y-, yeah,|ny
actually, I, I think it was a lot of money,|sd
but I, I don't, like I s-, -|sd
Well, it was a lot of money,|bf
but, -|%
Yeah,|aa
but, I, -|%
it got to the point where I didn't know what was going on|sd
so, -|%
You had to have the help, didn't you?|qy
That's right,|na
that's right.|na
Yeah.|b
Well, do you still do much work on them, then?|qy
I do.|na
Th-, -|%
act-, th-, actually that was just a, at, at the beginning of September|sd
and, whenever I can, I do try.|sd
I -|%
a-, actually, I'd say this.|h
I, I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore. Only because, -|sd
Disposal is a problem.|^2
Well, that is one problem,|aap_am
but also these, uh, these fast oil change places, you just can't beat them.|sv
That's true.|aa
For sixteen bucks they'll --|sd
That's true.|aa
Right,|aa
that, that, -|%
I've, I've quit doing that myself.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil, you know.|sd
Yep,|aa
that's right.|aa
And, uh, but, it, -|%
but, no,|ar
I guess, i-, -|%
that, -|%
and the main reason that it's, it's quick. -|sd
Well, have you seen a new movie lately?|qy
Well, uh, I am a student|sd
and I have, uh, been actually watching more movies on video,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I st-, I want to see the FISHER KING and, and, uh, catch ROBIN HOOD.|sd
Okay.|b
I, uh, I haven't seen either one of those.|sd
Uh, what, what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though?|qw
Uh, let's see.|^h
Uh, I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on.|sd
Uh, WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated, over hyped, um, recently.|sd
Well, you're catching me at, it, uh, uh, at mind's end here.|sd
What have you seen recently?|qw
Well, maybe you, uh, you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES.|qy^d
Yes.|ny
Okay.|b
Yes.|b
What did you think of that one?|qo
Enjoyed that quite a bit.|sd
Um, I thought the, uh, the cima-, the cinematography was excellent.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, the story was, -|sd
uh, though it tended to be a little one sided --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, it was, it was believable.|sd
I, uh, I just moved down, in fact, from South Dakota in, in June,|sd
and that's when the movie was filmed,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, we, when, when the movie came out, we went, -|sd
uh, my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and it was filmed right outside of Pierre.|sd
In fact, the buffalo, the scene, the big buffalo herd scene, that was, that was a live scene.|sd
Wow.|ba
Uh, there's a guy that has got a, a buffalo farm,|sd
and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and, and, uh, we, my dad has got a little plane, we flew over it all a-, looked at the buffalo,|sd
it was really neat.|sd
But, uh, so we are watching the, the movie in the movie theater in Pierre --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
or,|sd
They knew, they knew the extras or the, -|bf
Yeah.|aa
So, I kind of, I think I enjoyed it more when I, when I watched it on video cassette than I did, uh, in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that.|sd
I'd go now, now which one could that be --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I'd, I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of, of picking up the overall, -|sd
Scope.|^2
Right.|aa
Exactly.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
So, but I, I thought it was a good film.|sd
But you are right,|sv
I think, I think it was very one sided.|sv
It, it was,|sv
but it's a side that hasn't been told. Uh, as far as, you know, telling it from, you know, the Indians as the good guys and the, the white men as the bad guys.|sv
I, I really thought about, uh, all the, the westerns that we have seen for years and years,|sd
Sure.|b
and it's just, shoot the Indians,|sd
and they are always the savages.|sd
Right.|b
So, -|%
In fact, I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, but it was an interesting movie.|sd
Uh, have you seen PRETTY WOMAN?|qy
Yes.|ny
Now I thought that was a good show.|sd
Yeah.|aa
That was, that was a good movie.|sv
Um, it was just kind of a get away movie.|sv
Yeah.|b
Kind of, -|%
It didn't, uh, it didn't have any real social bearing|sv
or,|sv
but it was an enjoyable movie.|sd
It was, it was kind of like the STAR WARS --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Yes.|aa
You're bringing it,|sd
I don't know,|h
I had a, I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I've seen.|sd
But, yeah,|%
I've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES,|sd
and, uh, -|%
Uh, now are you, are you going to see, or do you, are you much of a STAR TREK fan,|qy
are you going to see this next one that's coming out?|qy
Oh, definitely.|na
Have you seen the rest?|qy
Yes.|ny
I think I've missed one.|sd
I'm not sure,|h
but I think I've missed one.|sd
I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago,|sd
and they showed all five in a row.|sd
Was that here in Dallas?|qy
Oh, they had it everywhere,|sd
uh, every major city had one theater that did it|sd
and, -|%
Okay.|b
Because we had one here in Dallas.|sd
Right,|aa
and they did it in Houston,|sd
they did it, well, they did it everywhere.|sd
And it was, it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed,|sd
and the thing that I didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row, uh, time wise they happen one after another --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but you can watch the characters develop,|sv
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
So Frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have?|qw
Well, uh I don't know that we really have a budget.|sd
I have a set amount that I, that I save.|sd
Actually, well actually there is a, a way, -|sd
budget our money apparently. -|sd
The, -|%
uh, my wife, uh, has so much, uh, gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks|sd
and, uh, we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff, gas, and things like that|sd
and besides that I, uh, you know, I have a set amount that I save every month.|sd
Right.|b
That's, uh, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I am single,|sd
so.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but I basically, -|%
Really don't need to.|^2
Right,|aa
I don't need to.|b^m
I am the only that I have to keep track of|sd
so it makes it a little bit easier.|sd
That's right.|aa
Uh, and also I, you know, I try to save a certain amount each month as well --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I try to, try to have an idea of what my expenses are|sd
and I am pretty consistent from month to month --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, whenever, uh, I need to, uh, whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it.|sd
Right.|b
Well, I found that, uh, you know, things, as I have gotten older, -|sd
I am in my fifties now,|sd
but before we use to have, to have to have a very strict budget,|sd
I had four kids|sd
and, uh, you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for, for this and for that.|sd
Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be.|sd
Uh, I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside, uh, I kind of fence off areas of my check book.|sd
For instance, there are certain things that I know come up, uh, every so often.|sd
Every six months I have to pay car insurance.|sd
Uh, every six months I have to pay my taxes.|sd
So --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh, uh, saving in|sd
and I also have got a checking account besides that,|sd
but, what I do on my money market account, my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out|sd
and I put it in parenthesis.|sd
I take it out of the right line total --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.|sd
Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside.|sd
Right.|b
And I guess that's a way of budgeting.|sd
Yeah.|aa
That's, -|%
I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More, uh, medium or longer range.|sd
I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for.|sd
Like I am, -|%
probably within a year I would like to buy a new car.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, I kind of have a, an amount in my mind|sd
and I am making every effort to, to sal-, put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Uh, cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them, but for keeping them on the road too.|sv
Right.|b
Uh, you know, we've got two cars.|sd
My wife has a car|sd
and I like to drive pick up truck.|sd
So, we are on a schedule where I try every, uh, three or four years to, to buy a new one.|sd
And you know I am constantly making car payments,|sd
but I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway, is making car payments.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, uh, you know, I get one paid for|sd
and, uh, actually I am saving up for another one besides|sd
so --|sd
Huh.|b
but --|sd
Right.|b
Have you thought about, uh, leasing?|qy
Well, uh, I have thought about it,|na
but leasing wouldn't, -|sd
you know, I don't use it for my business.|sd
I see.|bk
My wife uses hers just for pleasure|sd
and I use mine just to go back and forth to work --|sd
Right.|b
so. -|%
But if you are rolling it over every three years,|sv
Yeah,|aa
I guess.|aa
Uh,|%
You know, typically, you, if you purchase your own car you tend to make, uh, the best returns after you pay it off.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Of course, the longer you keep it beyond that point, the more profitable it is to own it yourself.|sv
Right.|aa
Yeah,|aa
you're right.|aa
Uh, I have, uh, been know to keep trucks or cars for oh, ten or twelve years,|sd
but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill|sd
and you got to put put stuff in them you know.|sv
That's right.|aa
Yeah,|%
mine's, uh, seven years old|sd
and I think last year was, that was a rough year for it.|sd
I had a number of expenses|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, I am hoping that most of them were just kind of, -|sd
uh, you know the, -|%
as you get to a certain number of miles, you have to get everything replaced, brakes, shocks and all that.|sd
So, I just went through that whole set last year.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again|sd
Those things can really upset your budget when they, when they come in.|sv
Uh, you know, it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the, for the unexpected shall we say.|sv
Right.|b
Right.|b
What line of work are you in?|qw
Okay, um.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
How has it been this week for you?|qw
Weather-wise, or otherwise?|qy
Weather-wise.|sd
Weather-wise.|b^m
Damp, cold, warm|sd
Oh, no,|ba
damp.|b^m
We have, we have gone through, what might be called the four seasons, uh, in the last week.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We have had highs of seventy-two, lows in the twenties.|sd
My goodness.|ba
Well, I don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then.|sd
It was ninety-six yesterday,|sd
I heard about that.|sd
and we set a record yesterday. And, uh, very windy,|sd
but then today the wind has dropped off, and also, the temperature, so, very cool, uh,|sd
I think right now it's like sixty-nine,|sd
Um|%
and that's cool for u-,|sd
or it feels cool compared to yesterday, but very pleasant,|sd
no rain in the last month, I don't think.|sd
The ground's very dry|sd
and our yard work, everything is in bloom,|sd
so our yard work is pretty tough, the ground being dry,|sd
but I guess it also, uh, brings about allergies,|sd
we're having a lot of allergies down here right now.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Everything blooming,|sd
and, and the weather. -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I think a lot of people have contracted, uh, spring fever too,|sd
so. Had a lot of people out at work, you know, for fishing, and, and uh,|sd
The blue flu,|bf
Yeah.|b
yeah,|b
the blue flu, or the white collar flu, depending on where you work, I guess.|bf
Yes.|aa
Oh, we have had, uh, as I've said, we have had variable weather. Uh,|sd
Um.|%
It has been untypically wet for this time of year,|sd
Um.|%
and, also, we have a lot of green, you know,|sd
the grass has been growing|sd
and if you look outside, you would like to go out and mow your lawn,|sd
Uh.|%
but fortunately it rains|sd
and you, uh, do not have to go out and buy the spark plug,|sd
Yeah.|b
But, we've had an unusually, uh, uh, warm spring,|sd
and, well I guess we're still in winter,|sd
and, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
No snow?|bh
To speak of, to speak of.|sd
Um.|%
We usually average, oh, anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter|sd
and this year, as well as last year, we have had less than four inches total accumulation.|sd
Um.|%
So, it's been inordinately warm, uh, here, for, uh, for this time of year.|sd
Um.|%
So, uh, in that regard, it's fine,|sd
but, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday.|sd
Yes,|aa
yes|aa
it is.|sd
Down in the more southern and western areas.|sd
And, of course we are, um, about two hours from the northern border, straight south,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, and, uh, very windy.|sd
It's amazing to me|sd
because I have only lived in Dallas for three years,|sd
and I cannot believe that the wind blows all the time.|sd
It does,|sd
I, I -|%
very seldom, if any, -|sd
I can't remember, you know, a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing.|sd
Uh-huh|b
Well, I spent six years in graduate school at, in Indiana. In the flatlands,|sd
and it was that way every day.|sd
Um.|%
Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour.|sd
Um.|%
so, that, uh, -|%
you, you became accustomed to it, I guess.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, otherwise w-, as I said, we have had, uh, a relatively mild winter,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, rea-, where did you go to school in Indiana?|qw
Purdue.|sd
Purdue.|b^m
I have a brother that lives in, uh, uh, South Bend, Indiana.|sd
Oh, yes.|ba
And, I had to always, -|sd
I've lived there for eight years myself.|sd
I'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame.|sd
But, I didn't. Uh.|sd
Well, you are not from that area originally, I can tell.|sv
No,|aa
originally I'm from New Mexico.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
I was born in New Mexico|sd
and we lived in, uh, South Bend for eighty, eight years, and, uh, then moved to, uh, Tennessee actually.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, -|%
Well, I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere.|sd
Very much,|aa
very much,|aa
cause I, I spent thirteen years there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
Gee,|ba
you've moved almost, moved around as much as I have|sv
Yeah, uh,|aa
my father was in the Air Force,|sd
so, -|%
Oh, I see.|bk
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I worked for the government,|sd
so I, I moved, uh, much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but, uh, I guess the, uh, this is my first conversation in this, uh, uh, series.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
I, I received a call last night because of the, uh, -|sd
I had not received my, uh, personal identification number.|sd
Right.|b
So, I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was, because I, I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line.|sd
Yeah|b
So, uh, is there any, -|qy
I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk.|sd
It's, um, it's just as long as you want to.|sd
Oh. O-,|%
I mean it's just, uh, as long as you want to, and just, you know, a reasonable lengthy conversation.|sd
Uh, do you work for Texas Instruments?|qy
No,|nn
I do not.|sd
I work for G T E.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
And, I, uh, of course, was, I was sent a, uh, an application from, uh, from Jack.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I've known Jack for some time.|sd
I'm in the speech processing business,|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
so I was very much interested,|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, actually, I, I work for Texas Instruments,|sd
and, uh, I'm an a, I'm an environmental engineer,|sd
Oh, I see.|bk
and, uh, they just published this internally, you know, getting people involved.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, that, that's really strange.|sv
I, I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though.|sd
I was saying, God, do we have a TI in Maryland|sd
or, -|%
I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, um, but I have, uh, I have been a speaker in other, uh, similar type of activities.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, I know the reason why this is, why the, uh, this is being gathered and the program and so forth,|sd
so, I was interested as I said, I was interested in being a speaker.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We haven't talked much about the weather|sd
Oh, well. -|b
I know that's what we're supposed to do.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Well, really it, uh, the letter just says, um, -|sd
let's see, I can't, -|^h
I was looking at it,|sd
I was trying to find out speedy short cuts,|sd
and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time, just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation, and, and, end it when needed.|sd
So. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
In environmental engineering, uh, -|bf
Uh-huh.|aa
is that with regard to work place engineering, or just, you know, environm-, the work place environment|qy
or, -|%
Uh, well, it's actually, um, waste water.|arp_nd
Oh, I see.|bk
Taking, taking care of uh, -|sd
I'm actually in the air division,|sd
and we monitor, um, anything that comes out of a stack, or out of a building,|sd
or, um, we do have customers that, um, their concerns are in the work place|sd
and we take care of that,|sd
but ,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I had -|%
my, the, the call last evening was supposed to be about, uh, concerning recycling|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
The call I received, -|sd
and so, I had, uh, I had thought a little bit about it, um,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, uh-huh.|b
So, I, -|%
but that, that's interesting.|sv
I have a, uh, uh, friend who is a planner.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
And, one of his, -|sd
and he models, uh, city districts, and so forth,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
And, one of the, uh, -|sd
he has inputs, or gets inputs from, uh, an environmental engineer. .|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
we actually, our division is corporate wide,|sd
and we take care of just the Dallas area.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Of course we have several plants here,|sd
but, um, we do air modeling also.|sd
Oh, I see.|bk
And, and, yeah, I take care of all the air modeling, specifically for the Dallas area.|sd
What we do, we have a weather station, that we get all of this information, you know, temperature, wind speed, wind direction,|sd
and, uh, we have a huge chemical data base.|sd
Well, that's interesting.|ba
And, uh, our, our chemical data base, so that we know every chemical on site|sd
and, and, um, its concentration,|sd
and if, if anything ever happened, God forbid, you know, a building explosion or something tha-, we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station.|sd
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Okay.|b
So tell me about CHINA CRY.|ad
Okay,|aa
CHINA CRY was basically the, the true story written by this, this lady who had, uh, was a native, a native Chinese, uh, uh, who was raised by Christian parents.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And her, her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty-nine revolution.|sd
I see.|bk
Although she, herself, had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other, uh, Christian, uh, portions of, of the faith, repentance, baptisms, et cetera, et cetera. She had always felt a very strong, uh, leaning in this direction.|sd
And whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty-nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their, all the clergy and so forth were killed or, or imprisoned or, and the property confiscated, she was safe because she had, you know, not officially joined the, the Christian movement.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So anyway, she, as she grew up towards maturity, her parents, well, -|sd
her dad was a doctor|sd
and, and he was rather well, you know, rather well to do in the old regime|sd
and the, the Chin-, the commu-, the communist Chinese didn't like this at all.|sd
You know, the bourgeoisie was, was, was definitely out of, uh, style, then.|sd
Right.|b
Everybody was back to a commonality of one.|sd
And so they kept picking at him, picking at his, at her mother and, uh, finally, uh, started picking on her.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
they were starting to, uh, accuse her of, of, of, uh, crimes and atrocities before the, the revolution and, and had her write her own story over and over and over.|sd
Uh, and the, uh, the major point of the movie was that, that she had, uh, married this, this Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court.|sd
Now, I think I'm leaving out a portion.|sd
She gr-, she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had, uh, gotten a job as, as an instructor|sd
and they had her teaching, or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Being a child, you know. -|sd
So, they kept on and on at, at her,|sd
and in the meantime, she and her husband, uh, were ex-, ex-, were expecting a child, their own child.|sd
And, uh, the, the people kept harassing her over, you know, over a period of months|sd
and finally they, uh, carried her, uh, out into the courtyard to, to, either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of, of shooting her, uh, with by firing, or, you know, executing her by firing squad.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, the Lord just said no,|sd
this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really, you know, -|^q
she's, she's one of mine,|^q
she is not going to die|^q
and, uh, the, the soldiers were blinded when they shot.|sd
Huh.|%
And she, her life was spared.|sd
And this, this frightened the, the, uh, the commandant|sd
and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp.|sd
Huh.|%
Well, uh, and, course, here's this, this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around.|sd
Huh.|%
Well she, she put in for going, going to, uh, -|sd
and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong, uh,|sd
and then she put in to go see him.|sd
And over time she, uh, uh, -|sd
finally, through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the, the middle, uh, bureauc-, bureaucracy that they finally let her go.|sd
Huh.|%
And, of course, she had to walk.|sd
You know, they, they stripped her of everything, practically besides the, the clothes on her back.|sd
And, uh, so she, so she went across the border to her husband and another, and other child that they'd already had --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
And they knew that she wasn't going to come back,|sd
but yeah, she did, years later when the, uh, liberalization, you know, in real life --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, she was not persecuted or anything else like that.|sd
Huh. Interesting story.|ba
Yes,|aa
it was.|aa
Uh, very moving, too.|sd
I, uh, I don't even remember seeing that advertised|sd
and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly.|sd
Well, it was within, oh, ninety days.|sd
Oh. That recent.|bh
Yeah.|ny
No,|ar
I mean it's, it was, it was advertised over a period of about ninety days.|sd
Oh, I see what you mean.|sd
But it wasn't, -|sd
uh, they didn't have it in, uh, too awfully many movie houses,|sd
but it was, it was, in the, -|sd
it had large, uh, uh, uh, press release.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, uh, I guess what I, what I saw most recently and luckily I saw it only a week ago so I'd remember --|sd
Okay.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, my husband and I had this great desire to go see a comedy|sd
and, and, uh, we ended up going to see GREEN CARD.|sd
GREEN CARD?|br
GREEN CARD.|na
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, he chose it|sd
and, uh, it's got this wonderful French actor who's, -|sd
it was his, like, his, -|sd
and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years,|sd
but he's never made an American film.|sd
This was his American film debut --|sd
Oh, I see,|bk
uh-huh.|b
-- and he speaks very broken English.|sd
And basically he played, uh, a Frenchman who married an American girl, uh, in a marriage of convenience --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right,|b
uh-huh.|b
And, uh, because she could claim she was married, she could get, uh, an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden, an, an, an outside garden, which is very unusual there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So she was a horticulturist,|sd
and that was sort of her dream.|sd
Oh, I see,|bk
uh-huh.|b
Of course, you know, they got married|sd
and they never saw each other again.|sd
Except, except fate through them together *through threw|sd
and the Immigration and national-, Naturalization Service, uh, started investigating.|sd
So they had to get back together and get their stories straight,|sd
and, and she was a very svelte, sophisticated urban New Yorker --|sd
Oh.|%
-- and he was a, a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the, on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer,|sd
but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
He'd been working in a restaurant when they met.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, they had to learn all about each other basically --|sd
Just then.|bf
And, uh, it was, -|sd
you knew what was going to happen, of course.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, they fell into like, at any rate|sd
and --|sd
Right,|b
uh-huh.|b
and then he said something, because his English was so poor on, for the most part,|sd
he, he was so proud of himself for giving ex-, all the correct answers that, that on the last one he said, oh, I never remember that answer|sd
and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So, uh, -|%
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
well, just to let you know, I have, uh, two, uh, children of my own.|sd
I've got two boys, uh, one four year old and one two years old,|sd
so I'm just starting out.|sd
Oh, yes|b
I have two boys who are twenty-eight and twenty-four --|sd
Wow|ba
Wow,|ba
that's quite a spread|sv
Yes.|aa
Same husband, everything.|sd
That's great.|ba
Uh but, -|%
Well, I guess, uh, in one of the things that, that I like to do with my boys when, uh, when I get home is, I like to try and spend a lot of time with them.|sd
You know, they're not very old,|sd
so they couldn't do a whole lot, yet.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But they like to, uh, spend time with me.|sd
We just, oh, just do various things, nothing really.|sd
They like to be outside as much as possible.|sd
If it's not raining.|sv
Right, uh,|aa
but, you know, the weather's trying to turn now|sd
so, -|%
Are, are you down here in Texas?|qy
Yes,|ny
I --|sd
Oh.|%
Okay,|b
yeah.|b
You know what I meant with rain, huh|qy
Right,|na
right.|na
Oh.|b
Right.|b
Okay, uh|b
what, -|%
Yeah,|b
what, w-, well, -|%
one of the things I've noticed is, one of the trends I've, I've noticed is that, uh, it's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the T V and let them watch movies or, or play video games or something.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I I have, -|sd
can you hold on just a sec-, --|ad
Sure.|aa
-- I have to answer a business phone|sd
Sure.|aa
I hate to do it on this call.|fa
That's okay.|bd
Good morning, A R E, this is Arlene Lister another|t3
It was just a recorded message,|sd
I'm sorry,|fa
keep going.|ad
No,|aa
it's okay.|bd
Uh, so that was the thing that I, I noticed that, I know a lot of people, lot of friends that we have, they have a tendency to do the same thing.|sd
And one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, seeing as you've got --|qw
Yeah.|b
Well, there, there was not nearly as much of it.|sd
In fact, I, I think things were, were quite a bit different.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, when my, my big kids were, were little, uh, you know, ev-, ev-, all the mothers were home.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, the, the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around|sd
and then when they felt like it, they went out to play, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
And, uh, I, I think it's gotten, uh, very different.|sv
When my second one was little, they were coming out with SESAME STREET --|sd
Right.|b
and, other than that, I mean, there was basically, there was not educational T V|sd
or --|sd
Um.|%
and that was it,|sd
but they, they were never that interested in it anyway.|sd
They'd rather, I mean, they'd take their trucks out in the backyard you know --|sd
Right.|b
But, we always did, uh, oh, just, you know, to the park for walks --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We did a lot of stuff like that --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, course, when they got bigger, uh, they were both quite into sports|sd
and, and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
-- and, uh, uh, a girl is very different|sv
We have -|sd
a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping|sv
Right|aa
So, they're very, very different,|sv
but, uh, y-, -|%
kind of the same thing, our, you know, -|sd
she now, -|sd
lot of time spent with her, -|sd
she's so busy|sd
is, uh --|sd
Uh-huh|b
like last night was a band concert --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and she plays on her school volleyball team and, uh, stuff like that.|sd
But, uh, we, we still, uh, oh, like to pack up, you know, just go someplace for the day --|sd
Right.|b
One of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at College Station --|sd
Oh, that's nice.|ba
-- so that's, uh, -|%
we go down there fairly often, you know, for a weekend for, you know, family get-togethers and stuff like that.|sd
That's great.|ba
Uh,|%
That's great.|ba
I know we'd, I'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things.|sd
And I think we probably will soon as the boys get a little --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, you know, for right now, they don't, you know, -|sd
just getting out in the front, and just being outside is good for them|sd
because they like --|sd
Oh, yes.|aa
Yeah,|aa
I, I think, our kids just always dearly loved that, you know, play bounce the ball, or --|sd
Uh-huh.|%
course, when our big ones were little, we lived up north, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and this time of the year it, it, the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves you know.|sd
Right.|b
So,|sd
That's true,|aa
you don't see many leaves around Dallas.|sd
and, and, uh, you know, we also, come winter time we'd stick them on sleds.|sd
And --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, and from little on, you know, -|sd
I'm, -|%
it's, it's so different down here where y-, you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something.|sd
You know, when our kids were little you, you got them a pair of skates|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
what do you feel are some of the main problems?|qw
Well, I'm in a, I'm in an urban area.|sd
I'm in Dallas.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem, uh, even a more major problem.|sd
Uh, in Dallas, some of the major problems, uh, -|sd
drugs seems to be re-, related to quite a bit of the crime we have now.|sd
There is a lot of theft, a lot of assault dealing with, uh, people trying to get money for drugs.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, I think that's a national problem, though.|sv
It, it, it's --|sd
It's not unique,|sv
We've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff.|sd
Yes.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well, now, we're pretty close to the golden triangle, aren't you?|qy
Yeah,|ny
that, that -|%
Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill is the triangle.|sd
Right,|aa
research triangle --|bf
Right.|aa
And, uh, I'm sure you have a lot of students there, uh, and a lot of researchers|sv
so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a little better economic climate,|sv
but, in all your cities now, it seems like th-, there is a, a crowd that's really effected by this bill.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it's, it's really, it's, -|%
and I've seen in more in Durham than I have in Raleigh or, or --|sd
Really?|bh
Chapel Hill is kind of a, a ritzy city or whatever.|sd
I mean, it's kind of, -|sd
I'm, I'm sure there is problems with it,|sd
but it has a pretty low crime rate. Compare, compared to, to, Durham has probably got the worst.|sd
They've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year.|sd
Really?|bh
And over half of it has been drug related.|sd
Um. Well, here, uh, I'm not sure how many Dallas has had.|sd
I've, uh, -|%
Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four,|sd
I, I don't know.|h
A, a number every week. -|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, Dallas is having quite a few.|sd
Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or, or, like I say, drug related.|sd
Uh, I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values.|sv
Seems like a, a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh, I, -|%
Well, that, -|%
and the, and the economy is so bad|sd
and,|sd
The economy is lousy|bf
They've done special stories on the news, local news here.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We had a lot of bank robberies and different, lot of break ins and stuff.|sd
I know, like a week or so ago, -|sd
I live in a, in a town house, which is, you know, -|sd
it's a pretty nice neighborhood|sd
and this lady was going to work,|sd
she came home and everything in her house was total gone, light fixtures, everything.|sd
And nobody thought any different,|sd
they just thought she was moving.|sd
It was a moving man pulled right up to her house, broke in and stole everything she owned|sd
Boy that really, that really takes someone who is bold to do that.|sv
Well, yeah,|aa
it's, it's, it's pretty bad|sv
Well, now, do you find that security is very good in, in a, in a town home?|qy
Uh, I would say so for the majority in, in our, in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home --|na
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we all know one another|sd
and, and, on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that.|sd
Well, that, -|%
It's, -|%
I, I'm, I'm probably the, one of the youngest people that live over here.|sd
I see.|bk
Most people are, are, retired|sd
or, or, or, you know, they're, they're in their forties or, or whatever.|sd
So and I'm in my twenties,|sd
so I, I'm, I'm out more than they are,|sd
but --|sd
Yeah.|b
so I really don't worry about anything.|sd
Well, I think you hit on one point there is you know each other.|sv
Yeah.|b
I'm, I'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything.|sd
Uh, I am, oh, about three blocks off a major road and, uh, a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs, -|sd
I guess you would say the neighborhood road, it runs between the high school and the, the commercial districts|sd
and, uh, I'm over the northeast part of Dallas.|sd
It's a, in a nice neighborhood.|sd
The houses here, uh, before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so|sd
and, course, everything's down ten to twenty percent now.|sd
Yeah,|b
see, that's the same thing here.|sd
But we have, uh, -|sd
one, one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away|sd
and now the economy is bad,|sd
they have trouble keeping those full|sd
so they've dropped the, uh, -|sd
they're not nearly as selective as they used to be.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, course, that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex.|sv
You start letting that happen and they go down|sv
and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things|sv
so, uh, I'm sure that aggravates it also.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, unemployment now in Dallas, or in Texas is up around six point, -|sd
I guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling.|sd
Yes.|aa
Well, lots, right?|qy
Right|na
Finally.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Really,|aa
what, what do you do, now?|qw
Well, we have saved our newspapers for years and years --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, so we've done that for quite some time,|sd
but since the price of paper has gone down -|sd
like it's about a fifth of what it used to be --|sd
Oh, really?|bh
-- so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the City took it over.|sd
Okay.|b
So now we just put ours out for the City of Plano.|sd
Do you live in Plano?|qy
Yes,|ny
I do.|sd
Okay,|b
yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
and I'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins.|sd
Right.|b
Have you had yours now?|qy
Yes.|ny
Yeah.|b
Although just, just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that, uh, work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs.|sd
Oh, that's why I asked you.|sd
Yeah.|b
and not everyone got theirs right away.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
And I, I was so relieved because I've been making a real concerted effort, make, you know, recycling the aluminum and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right,|b
yeah,|b
we used --|sd
And, uh -- -|%
-- my garage was just getting overwhelmed.|sd
I know.|aa
And, of course, I didn't go weekly,|sd
so it became quite a big --|sd
Right.|b
and, uh, -|%
Right,|aa
I'm really glad they do it.|sd
Uh, yeah,|%
I do news, mostly newspapers and, uh, plastic two liter diet Coke bottles|sd
Yes,|b
yeah.|b
but I don't use as many of those.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really, that are really dirty that you have to wash out|sv
Yeah,|aa
well, I found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two.|sd
Uh, ha.|ba
Uh, ha,|b^m
Wasting all your time and effort and,|bf
Thinking I was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
But, uh, you know, but it, it's not that hard now that I've got this --|sd
Got your routine down.|^2
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Well, I guess there are some places, uh, in the north, in particular that, uh, have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle|sd
because they charge you, let's see, they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight.|sd
Uh, uh-huh.|b
So if you recycle things, of course, then you don't have all that weight in there.|sd
Yeah,|b
I do find that I don't have as much to throw away --|sd
Right.|b
That's right.|aa
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
And, uh, I don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than, uh, -|sd
what are some of the things they don't recycle.|t1
Oh, one thing I thought about the other day were batteries,|sd
just everyday regular batteries.|sd
Um.|%
Right.|b
and, yet, what am I going to do when I have a couple double A batteries to toss out.|qh
Yeah,|aa
right.|aa
And they don't take, -|sd
Probably going to throw them in your trash|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's what happens|sd
because, -|%
Well, there are places that take car batteries,|sd
but I wonder if they would take, -|sd
Yeah.|b
I mean, not that it would -|sd
kind of a pain to, you know, drive over somewhere special just for that, for two little tiny batteries|sd
but, -|%
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
but I think the city one could possibly look into that or something.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
Uh, if they've got these bins for all the other little items, -|sd
I'm sure if p-, people will have batteries, uh, you know, quite often --|sv
Right,|aa
that's true.|aa
Uh, when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the, uh, the truck came by, well, we all ran out to watch it because, you know, we'd never really seen it --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he, uh, scanned across the little bar code --|sd
Oh.|b
Oh, is that right?|bh
and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just, you know, scanned it,|sd
so I don't know why, what that was reading it for --|sd
Huh.|%
-- but, uh -- -|%
Registering our garbage|bf
-- they must be trying to keep track of , you know, who is doing it, or what, I guess.|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't know.|h
Another, -|%
Wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year|qh
Ooh, for those who are really cooperating.|bf
Yeah.|b
Now, that would encourage it.|sv
Well, except I know it would just not be cost effective.|sv
They've already got all this money out on hiring, uh, getting the trucks and hiring people to work them.|sd
I'm sure they couldn't afford --|sv
Sure.|b
But -- -|%
Sure.|b
-- uh,|%
But the garbage, uh, -|sd
now there is just one garbage man that comes --|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
So that's interesting.|sv
Uh, also, slightly off the subject, but our, our big green garbage thing got stolen.|sd
Oh, it did?|bh
Uh-huh.|ny
Gosh.|ba
And we c-, we called the City|sd
and, uh, they, they brought us a new one|sd
and they did not charge us.|sd
And they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen.|sd
Oh, my goodness.|ba
Isn't that sad?|qy
It is sad.|na
And just, -|%
You know,|%
they paid for those things anyway.|sd
Oh, and they must be,|sv
Or, our taxes do.|sd
I mean, of course, we were hoping we weren't, we weren't going to have to pay for it, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, I mean, what would somebody do with them.|qh
Arlington, Texas -|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
now since I got somebody from Arlington, Virginia one day -|sd
Is that right?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Well, I never thought about that,|sd
but there is an Arlington,|sd
like I had a call the other day from Birmingham, Michigan --|sd
Oh --|b
and I was thinking --|sd
-- Birmingham.|b^m
the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama.|sd
Right.|aa
It's funny how many names have been used, uh, all over the country.|sv
Yeah,|aa
well, tell me what kind of books have you read?|qw
Well, to tell you the truth, I've been going to college for the last four years|sd
so mainly,|sd
I was going to say, not fun kind, right?|qy
No, um,|nn
but, I, I really tend to like biographies a lot, not necessarily always heavy ones --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, you know, sometimes biogr-, -|sd
I just read one about Grace Kelley.|sd
I love to read about real people.|sd
To me, half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories|sd
Yeah,|aa
it is,|sd
because you know that's it's really and truly --|sd
Yeah,|aa
it happened.|sd
You know, I read one about Bob Hope that I liked.|sd
Really?|bh
Yeah,|ny
that was real good.|sd
I'm like you,|sd
if it's not a heavy biography, you know --|sd
Right.|b
I used to like to read about royalty a lot.|sd
I, when I was younger I read about every king and queen that lived, I think, in Europe.|sd
That was my thing for a while.|sd
I was trying to think, uh, -|^h
I read a, uh, a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all,|sd
and there was a murder.|sd
Oh, really.|bh
Yeah,|ny
it was some time ago.|sd
Seems like it was THE SPY WENT DANCING, or something like that.|sd
Oh, it sounds like fun.|ba
It was a lot of fun because they used these real names, you know.|sd
Wonder if it was by one of those famous writers, you know|sd
Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those.|sd
Yeah,|aa
in fact I believe it was|sd
because, -|%
Really?|bh
Uh-huh.|ny
I believe.|sd
Sounds like something she would write.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I think it was by her, now that you mention it, because someone had given it to me,|sd
and I thought, well, this will be great,|sd
and it was.|sd
Yeah,|b
I've heard that she's done real-, you know, her books are really interesting,|sd
and they always sell well.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, -|%
Well, when you use real people like that, I think --|sv
Yeah,|aa
brings it to life.|sv
I know, uh, the Bri-, some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty.|sd
Yeah,|aa
but you know, that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth, you know.|sv
I know,|aa
our movie stars.|sv
Our movie stars,|b^m
because it's totally different concept to us.|sv
Oh, right.|aa
I haven't, I haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either.|sd
I have read, uh, mostly novels.|sd
I went to visit my daughter in Florida --|sd
Um.|%
-- and I took a novel with me, uh, and read it at Thanksgiving time,|sd
and, uh, it was, uh, one of those generation novels, you know --|sd
Oh, yes.|aa
-- starts out when they're small and continues through generations --|sd
Oh, I always like those.|sd
-- and I like that.|sd
Have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch?|qy
Yes,|ny
I have.|sd
Isn't she fabulous?|qy
Oh, she is wonderful.|na
Oh, once you st-, -|sd
I don't like to get one of her books|sd
because,|sd
I'll, I'll skip everything just to get back to the book|sd
I stayed up one night, I think until two --|sd
Oh, yeah.|ba
She's just a, -|sv
I don't know,|h
does she, how often does she come out with them.|qw
I probably have missed the last few since I've been back in school.|sd
Well, no,|ar
it seems like she doesn't write as often as, oh, well, like Danielle Steele and those silly things.|sd
She writes the same thing.|sv
Well, she can, she can turn them out overnight, I swear.|sv
Yeah,|aa
and, and they're the same silly things,|sv
I mean, if you've read one, I mean it's,|sv
Yeah,|aa
I've never read a whole one of hers, I don't think.|sd
And think how rich she is.|ad
Yeah,|aa
wouldn't I, you know, -|qh
I'm criticizing her,|sd
and wouldn't I like to have her money --|qh
Oh, yeah.|aa
-- because they go from hardback to paperback|sd
and she has millions of them.|sd
And then make movies out of some of them.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, mini series and so forth,|sd
and it seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often.|sd
I have not seen as many of hers.|sd
Well, hers are so involved,|sv
and they're so --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think she does a lot of research, too.|sv
I do too,|aa
so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular --|sv
Huh-uh.|aa
but oh, her books are just incredible.|sv
I don't think they've ever made a movie, do you?|qy
No,|nn
I don't think so,|sd
and I've often wondered why, haven't you?|qy
Yes --|ny
You know, I, -|%
-- well, no, uh,|ar
I really just thought about it now|sd
but there's just, -|%
Yeah.|b
Maybe it's because they take so much in.|sd
I don't know.|h
Uh-huh.|b
Maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them, you know.|sd
They're so big --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- they're such, you know, -|sd
it would be like another GONE WITH THE WIND, I guess --|sv
Yeah.|b
And maybe that turns people off,|sd
but look at GONE WITH THE WIND, you know.|ad
Oh, I know.|aa
It's about one of my favorite movies.|sd
Uh, have you, uh, gotten into SCARLETT yet?|qy
No,|nn
it had such a bad press,|sd
I wasn't too .|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's exactly what I was going to say.|sd
I was amazed,|sd
because I, -|%
in the beginning when it was on, you know, on route coming out --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
and then when it came out, all I heard was just, oh, how bad it was, that I didn't even want to get it.|sd
Me, either.|aa
Do you know anyone that's read it?|qy
Huh-uh.|nn
No,|aa
I haven't heard of anybody that's read it, either.|sd
No.|b
I think it was on the best-seller list, though --|sd
Well --|sd
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
So how do you just figure , -|qw
Well, you know, it depends upon our weather here. You know,|sd
today was a beautiful day|sd
it was like, uh, uh, summer day.|sd
It was seventy degrees|sd
so --|sd
Wow.|ba
it's a, uh, ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater, cardigan --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Because I had some appointments at the office today, some interviews|sd
and so I had to dress up anyway|sd
and then I wore heels, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But when it rains a lot, which is has been doing here a lot lately, uh, very often, you know, wear, uh, pants and boots --|sd
Oh.|b
So how do you dress?|qw
Well, um, I'm going to talk about when I was working as a teacher and when I was working at now.|oo_co_cc
Okay.|aa
Um, when I was a teacher, um, in Utah, I would generally wear, um, dresses and heels and things like that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and even when it, um, rained and snowed I just braved it|sd
and I wore heels anyway|sd
Yeah.|b
And, -|%
I, I can see, -|sd
I, I've been a teacher so has my daughter|sd
and I know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that,|sd
I know,|aa
it might kill you to go up and|bf
That's right.|aa
but you're going to look nice for the kids|bf
That's right|aa
and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than the kids, right?|qy
Oh, oh, yeah.|aa
Well, I need all the height I can get|sd
Yeah,|aa
I do too.|sd
So to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades,|sd
Oh, yeah.|aa
Uh-huh.|aa
Yeah,|aa
we too. Um,|sd
if it was real-, it looked really dangerous then I would wear boots|sd
but then I would change, um, into heels,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, um, -|%
Of course, we wear, uh, an unlined boots, you know,|sd
it has a heel on it.|sd
They're the kind of boots that I wear to work|sd
and we wear them, you know,|sd
they're a leather boot that you wear|sd
and as I said they have a regular heel on them, high heel.|sd
Oh.|b
And they wear them, we wear them a lot with shirts and things.|sd
Uh, it's kind of a, -|sd
I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear these boots. -|sd
They're not a cowboy boot,|sd
but they're just a real pretty boot,|sd
but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain.|sd
Oh.|b
As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I'm interviewing a parent, of course I feel like I need to wear heels --|sd
Sure.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Huh. Well, um, -|%
Of course, you probably wear coats a lot.|sv
Yeah, um,|aa
the first two years I was in a room where they didn't heat it|sd
So I did, -|sd
Oh, my goodness|ba
so then you had to.|bf
Yeah,|aa
and then the third year we, um, got heating|sd
so it was nice|sd
Yes.|aa
Then things improved, right?|qy
Right,|na
uh-huh.|ny
But of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know, you know,|sd
Oh, that's nice.|ba
and, uh, that's very seldom|sd
we, it depends upon our winter.|sd
We have a few days you might wear a coat, winter coat, you know,|sd
but most of the time you can wear a sweater|sd
and we just don't wear coats much.|sd
We often laugh about even when it turns chilly.|sd
We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh. Nice.|ba
Well -|%
It's really different.|sd
Let's put it that way.|h
Are you not teaching anymore?|qy
Uh, no,|nn
we, we moved to Iowa|sd
and, um, I'm working at a day care right now.|sd
I see.|bk
And so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months.|sd
Oh, so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet.|bf
Yeah,|aa
I wear, uh, tennis shoes,|sd
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
More practical.|^2
not, -|%
yes,|aa
it doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or something.|sd
When you were teaching, did you ever have, uh, uh, a blue jean day or anything like that?|qy
Yeah,|ny
but I never wore jeans because, um, I thought that was too casual|sd
Yeah, well,|b
For, -|%
I know that some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or something like that one, you know, or tacky day,|sd
and I always thought it was kind of out of, got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too.|sd
Yeah,|aa
really.|aa
It's all right for the students,|sv
they look tacky a lot|sv
but I didn't think teachers should, you know.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's how I feel too.|sd
Yeah.|b
Do you like, uh, uh, Iowa?|qy
Um, oh, it, there's some good things about it|arp_nd
but I've seen. A lot of things I'm not used to yet, um,|sd
Where did you live before?|qw
Um, we lived in Utah before|sd
and, and I grew up in California.|sd
Oh, well, that's quite a change from California to Utah,|bf
Well, uh, what is your favorite kind of music?|qw
Well, I have to say my favorite type of music would probably be, uh, classical music.|sd
Oh, same here.|aa
Oh, really.|bh
Yeah.|ny
What type of music do you like in the classical area,|qw
or what era do you, era do you like the most?|qw
Oh, well, I guess I like a wide range. Uh, everything from, uh, from Baroque through at least some modern music.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And my wife and I these days are especially into opera.|sd
We've been sort of opera fans for a few years now.|sd
Um, do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages?|qy
Well, we, uh, generally, -|%
the places we've gone they sing in the original languages.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Like the Dallas opera here normally does, I guess.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, I haven't gotten into that too much because, I, uh, if I don't know the story line and, um, I don't speak the language, then I have difficult time, comprehending what's going on.|sd
Well, one thing that's helped us a lot is that, uh, you, you know, you can buy a lot of these operas now on video casse-, uh, video tape --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so we have quite a collection of those,|sd
and you watch them at home,|sd
and they have subtitles,|sd
so you, you figure out what's going on after a while,|sd
and then you can enjoy it in the, uh, theater.|sd
Oh.|b
But, you know, the, uh, Dallas opera now has, uh, super titles on, on all their performances I think.|sd
What is that?|qw
Well, they, they give an, uh, an English translation on a, on a screen up above the stage.|sd
Oh, I didn't know that.|sd
Yeah.|b
That can help people like me.|sd
In fact, they even do that for operas sung, sung in English, because it is hard to understand the words sometimes.|sd
Well, I can understand that.|ba
So, I'd say,|sd
Yeah,|b
well, I really like Vivaldi.|sd
Uh, he's, uh, definitely one of the, one of the top of that era.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I like Baroque music,|sd
I like full body music, uh, with the, um, um, with brass and winds, woodwinds, instruments, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Course I like, uh, also string instruments,|sd
and I have two string instruments in my house. Uh, instrument players,|sd
both my sons play string instruments.|sd
One plays the cello|sd
and the other one plays the viola.|sd
Oh|b
So, I get to go to at least four or five concerts a year|sd
Uh-huh.|b
How, how old are they?|qw
One is thirteen and one is eleven.|sd
So they're doing this in school, or what?|qy
Yes.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
Yes .|b
Well, you've got half a string quartet there.|sv
Yeah.|aa
We're on our way.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, uh, um, I try to enjoy all of it.|sd
Well, since you seem to like, uh, Italian music, have you ever, uh, gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era, the, uh, period right before, actually before Vivaldi, I guess?|qy
Um, a little bit,|na
but, um, a lot of the, um, music I don't know about, uh, as far as the titles,|sd
and I have to listen to it, and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I do belong to a Musical Heritage Society.|sd
Oh, yes,|ba
uh-huh.|b
Do you belong to that?|qy
No,|nn
I don't,|sd
but I think I know what it is.|sd
Isn't that a, uh, uh, see, -|qy
can't you get records through that or something, recordings?|qy
You can get recordings.|na
Uh, they know have them on compact disc or --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, they do their, they do a lot of original recordings themselves.|sd
Yes,|b
yeah,|b
I think, uh.|%
But they also, uh, they also, uh, go to the different composers, or the different, I guess, -|sd
what do you call them the guys that orchestrate --|t1
Uh.|%
Uh, yes,|aa
right|aa
Yeah.|b
They go to conductors, uh,|sd
and, and they actually have them perform the music,|sd
and they record it.|sd
So, they're actually commissioned performances.|bf
Sure.|aa
A lot of them are.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Or they will kno-,|sd
and they will, uh, record the music at that time.|sd
And so, uh, it is, uh, uh, high quality grade music,|sd
and, of course, now they're getting, they also have a jazz section,|sd
and they also have a, uh, more contemporary and American --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I had go-, heard good things about the, uh, Music Heritage Society,|sd
but if I get involved in one of those things, I end up spending all my money on --|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, you can control it.|sv
I almost, uh, almost, uh, bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when I got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago.|sd
Oh, really.|bh
Yeah,|ny
my roommate signed me up.|sd
He got a bonus record,|sd
and I got a lot of bills|sd
I see.|bk
So we have to watch that.|sd
Well, that's good.|ba
Uh, do you play any instrument yourself?|qy
Yes,|ny
I, I play guitar and, and early years played saxophone.|sd
How do you feel about the Viet Nam war?|qo
Huh, well, um, you know, I guess it's pretty deep feelings, uh,|sd
I just, uh, went back and rented, uh, the movie, what is it, GOOD MORNING VIET NAM --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh. -|%
Yeah,|b
I saw that as well.|sd
Got that, uh, uh, some insight there, to, to kind of help me put together the feelings.|sd
I really appreciated the, the whole, uh, English class where the, uh, the, uh, fellow just wouldn't do it, you know,|sd
the guy's gouging, gouging your eyes out,|sd
what are you going to do?|qh
Uh-huh.|b
You know, what for him to finish me off -|sd
And, uh, it, it was, uh, good to remember the, uh, that, that kind of Asian philosophy --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, were --|qy
or, -|%
No,|nn
no,|nn
I was kind of an in-between, uh, finally drew a high draft number,|sd
and you?|qy
Um, I was much too young,|ng
I was born in sixty-seven,|sd
so. -|%
Oh|b
Um, you know, both my, well, both my brothers were, um, draft age,|sd
but neither of them wound up going over, which, I think they were very happy for.|sd
Well, I, personally, uh, you know, uh, I just went in limbo.|sd
I had a passport and was ready to go --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, I just didn't know.|sd
So, uh. -|%
Well, um, so well do you, do you feel that it was worth what we did over there?|qy
Um, yeah,|ny
just a second.|ad
Okay.|aa
Okay.|t3
Sure,|t3
now. Well, Mark, um, what was that again?|qw
Um, do you think, I mean, do you think, our invest-, the investment in lives and money was worth it?|qy
No,|nn
not, not really.|ng
I totally agree with that. Um.|aa
Um.|%
What, what effects do you think it's had on our country?|qw
Downside. Um, uh, well,|bf
the says we should, uh, go into the grief that, that's there|sd
and, you know, presidents have always avoided that --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So it's pretty serious, really, you know,|sv
lot of things that aren't being addressed. -|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think you know, that's pretty typical that, of the entire, entire involvement over that, you know, that nothing was really addressed,|sv
it was-, it wasn't, you know, it was never -|sv
we, we announced that we were going to war,|sd
it was such a gradual and subtle, you know --|sd
Yeah.|b
Gulf of Tonkin, uh, resolution -|^2
and was it a dolphin or a torpedo.|qh
You remember that?|qy
I vaguely remember we, um, we had a, we had a, um, spy ship torpedoed or something.|na
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
only only it was foggy|sd
and finally President Johnson said, well, they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo.|sd
Oh|b
Isn't that something?|bh
Uh-huh. Um,|ny
so, um, do, do, do you think that like, uh, um, for example like in, in this past war, in the Persian Gulf war --|qy
Uh-huh.|b
Hey Mark --|ad
Yeah.|b
Okay.|aa
We'll see you.|fc
I guess our five minutes are up according to me.|sd
Are they to you?|qy
Uh, I wasn't really keeping count.|sd
But I guess,|sd
good-bye.|fc
Yeah,|fc
okay,|fc
bye-bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
Okay, uh,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
my favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE|sd
and it has been for a long time|sd
but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it.|sd
Do you by any chance?|qy
Oh, yes.|ny
You do!|qy^d
Yes,|ny
very much.|sd
Well, wouldn't you know|ba
As a matter of fact, I prefer public television.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I have, particularly enjoy the English comedies,|sd
Yeah,|b
Yeah,|b
I watch mysteries too.|sd
Is that what you're referring to?|qy
Yes.|ny
Okay,|bk
yeah.|b
That is good.|ba
I like, uh, -|sd
do you read?|qy
Vociferously.|na
Okay,|bk
well that's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books.|sd
Yes.|b
And, the plots are more, um, challenging, you know, than the sitcoms of regular T V.|sv
Well, unfortunately for us at least here in the United States, we, the only access we have to that of course is public television.|sv
Yeah.|b
I'm, I'm not a great television watcher in any respect|sd
but, uh, the watching, -|%
what I do watch is, uh, usually news and whatever is on public television.|sd
Any kind of, -|%
I also uh, am very fond of great performances,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
Me too.|aa
But, uh -|%
Did you stay up late and catch this RED DWARF?|qy
No|nn
Oh, that was a scream.|sv
no,|nn
no|nn
as a matter of fact, uh, Turner Broadcasting,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
Really.|b
so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies,|sd
I used to like him too,|sd
he was my hero.|sd
In fact, I like Sean Connery to this day.|sd
Well, they're showing uh, LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, -|%
Oh, he can never cut it|sv
No,|aa
no|aa
that's true.|sv
I was just thinking that today, he did,|sv
Yeah,|aa
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
he does.|sv
Whereas, uh, Sean Connery has maintained the, uh, how would you, uh, ruddy look,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|aa
I liked his accent too.|sd
And, he can even be in movies that are not, uh, uh, sexually oriented,|sv
and he still comes off great.|sv
Well, you know he was, when was it, last year or year before last, he was voted the sexiest actor in movies,|sd
He is.|sv
Yeah,|aa
he had my vote double|sd
I mean the man is sixty-two years old.|sd
I don't care|sd
But, uh, but otherwise you know we, -|%
uh, with P B S and so forth. -|%
And I,|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh, what's that about?|qw
That was about a, the Interior Minister,|sd
it was a comedy,|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
yeah.|b
the Interior Minister of, in England,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Right,|b
I, I've seen it several times.|sd
It's a scream,|sv
but I have to go to bed,|sd
I have to get up and, and work the next morning.|sd
I wish they'd put those, -|sd
that's why I say, did you stay up late to watch this RED DWARF.|sd
It came on after DOCTOR WHO,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it should, -|sv
of course I li- -|%
really it was, -|%
I don't think they should show it during prime time,|sv
but still,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I know.|b
Well I, I, I'm not much of a television watcher.|sd
I, I read as I said,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I read about two or three novels a week,|sd
Yeah.|b
What, what do you do?|qw
What kind of work do you do?|qw
I'm a Payroll Clerk.|sd
Just an accounting clerk.|sd
At T I?|qy^d
No, uh,|nn
I have a friend who works for T I|sd
and I work for a tire service,|sd
Oh, I see.|bk
I'm from Dallas.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well the last two people who have called, both worked for T I|sd
and I just wondered.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
it could be T I -ers, I think, probably are participating more than anybody else,|sv
but I needed the money.|sd
This is five bucks here.|sd
I think that's something we all ca-, -|sv
Yeah,|aa
really.|aa
Do you work for T I?|qy
No,|nn
no,|nn
I work for G T E.|sd
Really?|bh
yes.|ny
How did you hear, -|qw
oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though, are we?|qy
I guess not.|ng
How did I hear about it?|br
Well I work, you know, -|sd
they are gathering a data base for voice processing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, that's my field of work also.|sd
Oh!|b
So I, I know the people at T I who are doing this|sd
and I heard about it,|sd
so I called them and asked if I could participate. And, uh,|sd
Oh.|b
Right.|b
We could go back to television shows.|oo_co_cc
Well, you know, speaking of public TV, have you caught any of this series on the Bible?|qy
Yes,|ny
I have.|sd
I've heard that it's really against the, well I mean that it's coming out with the idea that the Bible's not true.|sd
Well, no.|ar
That's, uh, -|%
you could interpret it that way.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I, I think what they are trying to say, is that there is a great deal of historical truth,|sv
but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh, after the what, uh, was is it the King James Version when the committee did it, wrote the translation, that so much was lost in the translation, particularly since most of the translations were in Greek.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, for example. In Greek there are seven different words for love.|sd
Right.|b
Okay,|b
so you can have, -|sd
there's one word for love of your brother, one word for love of your wife, one word for, you know, uh, love of your father, and that sort of thing.|sd
So, in, as to those types of interpretations, uh, really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now, and what it's at.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So that's, you know, -|%
you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true,|sv
but there's too much historical fact involved just from the uh, the histories that are, were developed around that time, that are available.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, you know, it depends on how you look at it.|h
Yeah.|b
You can look at it, you know, -|sv
if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true, then you can very much look at it that way.|sv
I guess if you're looking for that, you're, -|sv
Yeah,|b
well,|sv
that, uh, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
Really.|b
But, uh, as, as far as that goes, I, we at least agree on what we enjoy.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's right.|ba
But, uh, I don't know if there is, there is a time limit on this,|sd
Yeah.|b
Surely we've made it.|sv
I think so too.|aa
Let's just, -|ad
it's been very pleasant talking to you,|fc
It was very nice talking to you.|fc
and have a good evening.|fc
You too.|fc
Good night!|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Uh, Robert what do you, uh, think, what substances do you think are the most, uh, likely causes of air pollution?|qw
Um, gee,|ba
I don't, I mean, -|sd
I, I guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust, you know,|sv
they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that.|sd
Right.|b
So, I believe them|sd
but I'm not a chemist.|h
Do you, uh, do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like ai-, acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from, uh, industrial areas, factories and so on?|qy
I don't really know, um,|no
I grew up in Los Angeles and have felt like I was victimized by air pollution.|sd
I was going to say, -|sd
and, and you, so you understand smog|qy^d
I understand it very well|na
and in fact I was a private pilot there,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I can remember very etched, etched clearly in my mind, uh, flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and, and really being unbelieving at,|sd
Wow.|ba
it just looked liked peanut butter.|sv
My word.|ba
Thick and brown and so on.|sd
And that was, a few years ago?|qy^d
This was quite a few years ago.|na
This was in the nineteen sixties.|sd
I, I wonder if it's any better now.|qy^d
People say that it is somewhat better.|sd
Right.|b
Um, I, I don't know if you he-, re-, heard about the, uh, recent legislation in, uh, Colorado, uh, against a power company, uh, that's actually on Indian land, I believe,|sd
but, uh, it has been ruled against, uh, regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon.|sd
Um.|%
So they, -|%
it was, uh, a landmark case because it's unusual to, um, -|sd
I can, -|%
they, they were talking about shutting it down, or if it didn't comply and so on.|sd
So did it burn coal?|qy
I don't know that,|no
the information is one of those wire services kind of news, pieces of news, you know,|sd
so it's hard,|sv
I never did see the full story,|sd
so I don't know.|sd
Yeah.|b
But they said that, that it really caused so much smog over, uh, the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the, uh, piloting, uh, you know, the helicopter trips and that sort of thing.|sd
Um.|%
Yeah.|b
I mean that's such a spectacle.|sv
It would be a shame to ruin it.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh, what do you think individuals could do, or society could do to alleviate this problem.|qw
Uh, I don't, uh, I don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals. Uh, maybe just take good care of our cars,|sv
Right.|b
apart from that, I, I don't know what we can do as individuals.|sd
What do you think we can do?|qw
Uh-huh,|b
you think, it's more, more to society.|bf
Well I guess I kind of agree there.|sd
I, uh, -|%
on an individual basis there isn't a lot we can do about a lot of things|sv
but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can, uh, force, uh, government, uh, that we elect to deal more seriously with it.|sv
Yeah.|b
And I do think that we have a responsibility there.|sv
I must admit I'm not always real politically active|sd
but I do think that, um, Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards.|sv
Yeah.|b
And it's brought the, -|sv
they, uh, really listen to -|sv
the, the, uh, lobbyist and, uh, the car manufacturing companies have, uh, you know, have really pushed,|sv
they , -|%
all those re-, restrictions are really too hard,|^q
we can't, we can't quite make that go|^q
and they don't -|%
and then we still live with air pollution.|sd
Yeah.|b
Um, so I suspect that that's one thing that, that as individuals, we can do, make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators.|sv
But, um, as a society, I think we can do more|sv
and that's probably how we ought to do it. Uh, individ-, being individually responsible as, uh, gro-, in order to be group responsible.|sv
Yeah,|b
I guess I'm, I'm to the point where I'm cynical enough that I really don't believe anything will happen unless, unless there's something economically justifiable about it.|sv
Right.|b
And in the case of air pollution, it simply might turn out at some point down the road, to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I suspect that the pub-, that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure, uh, come to bear on the companies that deal with it|sv
and probably the only way that can happen is for, um, governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't.|sv
Yeah.|b
And, uh, I don't know how long that, that will take.|sd
People also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it.|sv
So, if you don't want to burn coal for power,|qh
Sure.|b
Well we don't want that either.|sv
Exactly,|aa
yeah,|aa
right.|aa
How about investing in the sun.|qh
Well nobody wants to pay twenty-five cents a kilowatt hour, I don't think.|sv
Right.|b
Uh, I probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it.|sv
Well it's just the same thing with the car, uh, uh, the gasoline,|sv
now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline,|sv
Oh yes,|aa
yes,|aa
yes.|aa
and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent|sv
and they don't want, they don't want to pay for it.|sv
So instead, we spend billions of dollars going to war.|sv
Yes.|aa
Uh, you know, wha-, -|%
however, it might have had other causes.|h
Certainly oil was a big factor.|sv
Oh certainly,|aa
yes.|aa
Um, and I think that's probably going to happen with, with such things as air pollution,|sv
Yeah.|b
do you have any air pollution in your area?|qy
There's not really a lot here in Raleigh.|ng
Uh, once in a while we'll get some, uh,|sd
I think it kind of washes down from, uh, from your area Linda|sv
Oh no.|ba
That's what they, that's what they, -|%
You're talking about from, from the, uh, the middle, middle states,|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
that's what they say|sd
but it's it's not, it's not very usual|sd
and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities.|sd
Yeah,|b
we really don't have that either.|sd
Although I think I can tell a difference in, I lived in this area for about twenty-five years and I think I can tell a difference in the comfort level, uh, particularly in the summer. Uh, you know, when it gets hot,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
It seems to me that I'm more uncomfortable|sv
and, you know, my eyes sting more and so on and so on.|sd
So I suspect that it's, it's an ever growing problem.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well I suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here.|sv
Right,|aa
I think,|sd
It was nice talking to you.|fc
and I enjoyed the conversation.|fc
So did I.|fc
Bye, bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
well, my favorite, probably, all time T V show is STAR TREK.|sd
And I would it like that, -|sd
I, I like the adventure of it.|sd
Uh-huh|b
Uh-huh.|b
And then I like the, -|sd
they have a new one now.|sd
The STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION.|sd
Right|b
and I've, I've always liked that show probably the very best.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think I've actually seen a number of STAR TREKS, one way or another over the years. Uh, although I never watched it regularly.|sd
I'm certainly acquainted with the character --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then I've seen some of the STAR TREK movies.|sd
Yeah,|b
those, -|%
the movies are good too.|sv
And I, I guess all, most of the shows I like are, are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure|sd
Uh-huh.|b
When I, when I started thinking about this, that those are some of my favorite shows, MCGYVER, because it's, it's only one person there, more than, uh, you know, instead of a cast --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap, and grabbing what he can and, you know, pieces of baling wire and, and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider|sd
and -|%
I don't think I, I've even heard of that show.|sd
You haven't?|qy^d
It's called MCGYVER?|qy^d
Uh-huh.|ny
And what is, what is he?|qw
He's like a semigovernment type agent. Who goes out then to, uh, works for the Phoenix Foundation, supposedly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, h-, his big thing is that he can take pieces of, little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things.|sd
He took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So he, he does all kinds of strange things like that.|sd
Oh, great.|ba
Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard,|sv
Yeah.|b
See what we can come up with.|bf
Do you like the, uh, news shows, TWENTY TWENTY, SIXTY MINUTES, those kind of things?|qy
Well, uh, I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES as a matter of fact,|sd
and uh, and I used to like the show very much.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, unfortunately I find getting rid of your T V set, you do throw out some, some of the baby,|sv
Some of the --|^2
yeah.|aa
And uh, I just decided I had to do that. I think, in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it,|sd
I mean I could just sit mindlessly in front of a T V set for hours.|sd
Uh.|%
And I just realized, I was sort of like an alcoholic,|sd
if I didn't get the booze out of the house, I was going to drink.|sv
Oh.|b
So. -|%
I guess I haven't ever had any trouble with that.|sd
I have more or less, I have my favorite shows|sd
and I usually make time in my day or my week, you know, to watch those.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, for the most part, I try, I have small kids and I try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time, really when they're up.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Because they're, -|%
I guess that, that, that falls , -|%
and one of my other favorite shows is SESAME STREET because of the kids.|sd
I like that real well.|sd
Right,|b
well, when my kids were little, I did have a T V set|sd
and I did watch a lot of SESAME STREET and a lot of ELECTRIC COMPANY, as well.|sd
I don't think they have that on anymore.|sd
Well that would be a shame.|sv
I haven't seen the ELECTRIC COMPANY in a long time.|sd
I, I remember it when I was younger of, you know, catching it on P B S,|sd
but, uh, I don't think they show, -|sd
it must be in, -|sd
maybe it's in, -|sv
if it was in repeats, -|sd
but they're not making new ones.|sd
Huh.|b
I haven't seen it in a long time.|sd
But SESAME STREET is still really good.|sv
Yeah.|b
How about MISTER ROGERS,|qw
is he still around?|qy
Yes.|ny
Yeah.|ny
They still show MISTER ROGERS.|sd
I don't think he's making new ones,|sv
but they repeat all the old ones.|sd
I see.|b
I see.|b
So that's still a real good show too.|sv
I, -|%
that one tends to come on earlier in the day than I want to turn the T V on|sd
Uh-huh.|b
SESAME STREET comes on from like nine to ten, which is a good time|sv
and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go,|sv
so it's -|%
the timing of, of it is good, besides the amo-, what's on.|sv
Right.|b
I figure your children are preschool?|qy^d
Yes,|ny
I have two little ones.|sd
Yeah.|b
So they like that.|sd
Yeah,|b
I seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon.|qy^d
They come on both.|sd
They come on like from nine to ten and then from, uh, five to six.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
okay.|bk
They just repeat --|sd
Okay.|b
that's another thing that's good about it,|sv
when it comes on right in the dinner hour. I f-, can feel like I can let them sit in front of the T V and watch,|sd
and they're watching something worthwhile, while I can make dinner and do things I need to do --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
little, with little kids the T V set really is a, I mean -|sd
I used it as a pacifier.|sd
Yeah.|b
I'm not sure it was that great for my children,|sd
but they turned out okay,|sd
so. -|%
Uh, it didn't hurt them any.|bf
Yeah.|aa
Some shows are good for, -|sv
I think some shows, some, -|sd
STAR TREK, I, -|%
for the imagination of it all. -|sd
The idea, I, I think that's one of the things I like about STAR TREK.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And is, is the, -|%
even in for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff.|sv
I don't let my little ones watch it,|sd
but the imagination of, look what we can do, you know, in the future, this is, perhaps, this will be possible.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Okay,|b
well, I think we've covered most of my favorite T V shows.|sd
Well, I'm trying to think if I ever even had a favorite one at one time, uh.|sd
Let's see, how about, uh, MAN FROM UNCLE?|qo
I do seem to reme-, -|%
is that the one where they, uh, he always got this, this tape recording that self-destructed?|qy
That's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.|sd
Uh, MISSION, -|b^m
that's right,|aa
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.|b^m
Yeah,|%
I used to watch that.|sd
In fact, I can still remember a couple of those.|sd
They were, -|%
I thought those were very good.|sv
Yeah,|b
they always have, -|%
I've, I've seen some of them on repeats.|sd
Yeah.|b
That uh, -|%
they always had a good plot.|sv
Huh.|%
It kind of kept you guessing on, on, uh, what was going to happen next|sv
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
You, -|%
How they're going get out of their latest scrape.|qh
Yeah,|b
I do remember that.|sd
And, uh, I remember as a kid my parents watching the ED SULLIVAN Show.|sd
That was really the big deal in our household, was the ED SULLIVAN SHOW.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
every Saturday night?|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
I gu-, I guess it was a Saturday night,|sd
and I went to see the movie THE DOORS a couple of days ago,|sd
and they had this scene, uh, that por-, portraying THE DOORS' appearance on the ED SULLIVAN SHOW.|sd
Huh.|%
They even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan,|sd
and it was very, very funny.|sv
I think it was the funniest part of the, of that movie.|sv
Um.|%
Well, I don't know,|h
was there any, -|qy
I remember the MILTON BERLE SHOW even,|sd
I was,|%
Ye-,|%
I'm not old enough to recall that one|sd
well I guess, I have to admit that I am|sd
My T V viewing started sort of mid-sixties,|sd
so. -|%
I see.|b
My folks didn't, my folks, -|%
I'm not even sure if we had one when I was really little.|sd
That may be why, bu-, -|%
they probably didn't have a T V until I got to be, you know, grade school or so.|sd
Yeah.|b
And the shows that I like now, they wouldn't let me watch.|sd
I had to catch them all on repeats.|sd
Like STAR TREK, they thought that was much too violent for small children.|sd
So -|%
Huh.|%
I, I, I ended up watching a lot of these things on, you know, repeats in the afternoons or something.|sd
Yeah.|b
That's, that's interesting.|sv
Uh, I think it's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from TV,|sv
people were just as violent before T V was invented, maybe even more so.|sv
Yeah.|b
But I guess that's, that's a different topic|sv
isn't it?|^g
Probably so|na
Well, I think that's about, uh, that's about covered it for me,|sd
so I think I'll say good-bye|fc
and we'll talk another time perhaps|fc
Yeah.|fc
Well, it was nice talking to you.|fc
Tell me, tell me where you're calling from.|ad
I'm calling from Garland, Texas.|sd
Garland, Texas.|b^m
Uh-huh.|aa
All right.|bk
I'm in Nor-, -|sd
Where are you from?|qw
I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.|sd
Oh, my goodness.|ba
I didn't know they did it long distance.|sd
Yeah,|b
I think they're doing it, trying to do it, or I hope they're trying to do it all over the country, because they need to collect all kinds of different --|sv
Yes.|b
Well, it was nice talking to you|fc
Same here.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Uh, the last movie that I saw, -|sd
I, I don't go to that many|sd
so I'll just have to talk about the ones that I went to see,|sd
but,|sd
Okay.|b
Yes,|b
uh-huh.|b
Have you seen it.|qy^d
No|nn
unfortunately I haven't,|sd
I heard it's really good,|sd
but. -|%
It is.|sv
I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
He is one of the best actors I've ever seen.|sv
It's, -|%
there's a point where, -|%
the, uh, the show is about these, uh, catatonic type people that, -|sd
this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the, the living, more or less,|sd
but it wears off.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic, you know, uh, -|sd
it starts off with like a tic,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then it gets to where he can't, you know, control his movements at all.|sd
And it was just so realistic.|sd
The way, you know, you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
What does, uh, -|qw
is -|%
Robby, Robin Williams, does he have a funny part in it?|qy
No,|nn
it was very serious, very se-, -|sd
Oh how does he do serious.|qo
He's good,|sv
he's, he's talented,|sv
boy, he is.|ba
I've only seen him in funny stuff|sd
and so. -|%
I know,|b
me too.|sd
But, uh, well, what was that show, um, Gar-, uh, Garf-, -|qw^d
I want to say Garfield|sd
but that wasn't it.|sd
Yeah,|b
uh, GARP, THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.|sd
Yeah,|aa
THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.|sd
He wasn't always funny in that show, was he.|qy
I didn't read, see the, the movie,|no
I read the book|sd
but I, -|%
I did too.|sd
That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part|sd
Yeah,|b
in fact, it got some pretty serious deep parts in it|sd
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
right.|b
Yeah.|b
Well what have you seen?|qw
I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES.|sd
Oh, I saw it.|sd
Good,|b
we've both seen one|sd
Did you cry through it?|qy
Yes,|ny
the whole way|sd
It was telling a friend, I, I said, I only cried twice,|sd
but each was about half an hour long,|^q
so. -|%
Where did you cry.|qw^d
Um, let's see,|^h
when I, each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed, I cried.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I cried the first time when the, um, the wagon man got killed, when they attacked him.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|b
yeah.|b
And, uh, I think from there on, all the way through the movie. -|sd
Let's see what else did it. Um, what other parts.|^h
I can't remember any of the other parts right off now.|sd
I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed|sd
We-, -|%
I don't remember when the horse got killed.|sd
Oh, th-, -|%
when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
And then he, uh, the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards, you know|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And that horse has been such a pal to him,|sd
Yeah.|b
You can tell I'm an animal lover,|sv
you can hear my dog|sv
Unfortunately we don't have any animals,|sd
so, uh. -|%
Yeah.|b
It was a beautiful story,|sv
it really was.|sv
It, -|%
there was a lot of pretty scenery, too, in that movie.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
What did you think about the buffalo scenes.|qw^d
Oh, I thought it was awful,|sv
That was,|aa
Yeah.|b
I mean I hadn't even imagined it, you know.|sd
I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I had a friend who had fixed some, uh, chili, buffalo chili and, about a week before went to see the movie.|sd
Oh, oh.|b
Of course they raise them now, you know, to eat.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|b
it's not, -|%
But she, we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in.|sd
No|aa
it wasn't|sd
Um, I thought the scenes when the buffalos running, though, were beautiful,|sv
like that was great.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
And there were so many of them.|sd
I didn't know that, that many buffaloes alive, much less in one place.|sd
Yeah,|b
really.|b
So that was pretty.|sv
And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape, you know, you could follow this, this beaten down path,|sd
Yeah.|b
and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing.|sv
I wonder how they kept up with them, though,|sd
it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast.|sd
I know.|aa
I guess they graze, though,|sd
that wouldn't be a problem.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Uh, have you seen any of the behind the scenes, uh, of, of that movie.|qy^d
No,|nn
huh-uh.|nn
It was, -|%
they tried to keep it, you know, as very close to real.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes|sd
and, uh, they had to teach a wolf how to, to howl.|sd
Oh.|b
That's the, part they had trouble finding was wolves|sd
I guess they're just not domesticated,|sv
or, or, -|%
Yeah,|b
what, -|%
they just don't howl that much anymore.|sv
I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off|sd
and that's all they'd have to do|sd
Yeah.|b
Well that's funny.|ba
Well, I think we've made it.|sv
Oh is that five minutes,|qy^d
is that, -|%
I don't know,|no
is it five or three.|qy
Okay, oh,|bk

Not as nice as California|sd
How long have you been here?|qw

Oh, okay.|bk
I've been here long en-, pretty long.|sd
So. -|%
You, you, you know about August then.|qy^d
Yes,|ny
oh, I've been through five of those|sd
Okay,|b
there's no surprises left.|sv
Right,|b
right.|b
A lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in August, for, you know, -|sd
if they're going to go out of state for vacation --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Good idea.|ba
Real good idea.|ba
Yeah,|b
we went up to Wyoming this last, uh, Summer during that time.|sd
And it was like you know, eighty degrees up there.|sd
It was beautiful.|sd
Nice to get out of Texas for a while.|sd
We went to Alaska.|sd
Well, that's, that's the even, even farther away.|sd
That is really nice.|sd
It is so cool, you wear a jacket, you know.|sd
Even in the Summer time, huh.|bf
Yeah,|aa
or keep one handy.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Is that right?|bh
Uh, it, -|%
they call it their liquid gold.|sd
Um.|%

you get sunshine,|sd

Green.|^2
Um.|%
Oh my goodness, it's pretty.|ba
Right.|b
Well, Texas isn't bad.|sv
No,|aa
no.|aa
Not in the Spring.|sv
Right.|b
I have to think every year to try to remember what it was, what's it supposed to like this time of year.|sd
Spring is nice.|sv
Yeah.|b
Because March we usually get a lot of rain, in March, you know.|sd
It'll seem the news, the Harold Taft, you know, on the local news.|sd
Right.|b
March we typically get a lot of rain,|sd
and we've had this many inches,|sd
and, you know, we're right on target, you know,|sd
and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March,|sd
but I -- -|%
Oh, we always --|sd
-- it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like.|sd
Yeah --|b
uh, it, -|%
-- I wish, I just wish it wouldn't come all at once|sd
That's right,|ba
and --|sd
Right.|b
Well, it's just that, you know,|sv
when it rains, it rains.|sv
In California you get these nice, lovely rains, you know, nothing really down-, you know, like downpours like you have here.|sd
The other day we had some hail, the biggest hail I've ever seen in Texas.|sd
Oh, really.|b
Yeah,|b
I live in Garland.|sd
Oh, you got into that bad stuff.|sv
Yeah.|aa
We got hail the size of marbles.|sd
I mean, just so noisy hitting the house|sd
and the glass on the windows.|sd
It didn't break anything,|sd
but we went out there afterwards|sd
and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn.|sd
Isn't that strange.|ba
I know, I, -|%
you pick them up, you know,|sd
and they're perfectly round.|sd
And I go, gee, how did they form, you know, so perfect like that.|sd
I think that's one of the strange, strange things,|sv
and you very seldom see it though.|sv
Right,|b
right.|b
I've seen hail, you know,|sd
but usually the size, you know, of, uh, tiny, tiny pebbles.|sd
You know, really small, you know.|sd
But this was, uh, really large.|sd
So it had come, it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently.|sv
Is that correct?|qy
Uh, I don't know how hail is formed --|no
I think, I think --|sv
You don't think it's cold enough, you know to, -|sv
It's not on the ground,|sd
but --|sd
Right,|b
must be.|sv
I guess,|sv
and then, I think, you know, all that falling would warm it up and melt it,|sv
but maybe that's what rounds it, I don't know. But, tumbling.|sv
I was dumb.|sd
I was in, um, Florida for a week on business.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I had called back to the house.|sd
I stayed the weekend,|sd
and I called back to the house.|sd
My housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs, pitched said something to the effect of, now we've made the national news, don't get upset, and don't worry,|sd
it's in Garland where all the bad weather is.|sd
I said, Okay, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I watched the news,|sd
and I thought, ha ha, that's Garland, that's not Plano,|sd
I don't have anything to worry about.|sd
I was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me, stupid, you own property in Garland|sd
Felt so dumb.|sd
Um.|%
Finally I got home and found out my property was okay.|sd
Yeah.|b
There was no problem with it.|sd
But I guess you just tend to think of, of where your house is --|sv
Right.|b
Right,|b
and close to that, what's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland, that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's, there's the hard rain.|sd
Oh, oh, I see.|b
The creek overflows|sd
and a lot of houses, a lot of houses around that creek seem to, to get flooded --|sd
Oh, okay.|b
-- the streets and stuff around that area,|sd
The house, that house,|sd
Okay.|b
Just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through.|sd
Right.|b
That's where I live, close to that.|sd
Oh really.|b
Yeah,|b
uh, uh, not quite,|sd
I don't live in that Firewheel division.|sd
But I live close by there --|sd
Is that a nice area?|qy
Yeah|ny
they're supposed to, -|sd
it's getting built up, you know, with more new, new shopping centers and things. You know,|sd
it's a fairly new area.|sd
Yeah|%
and, uh, and they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by, by the next, by ninety-three or ninety-four or something,|sd
a brand new mall --|sd
Well, -|%
so. -|%
The house that --|sd
It'd be nice.|ba
Uh-huh,|b
in the Firewheel Estates there, whatever.|qy^d
Yes,|ny
yes.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
Really, really nice home, very pretty. Uh.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But you're not living there right now.|qy^d
No,|nn
I'm going to lease it.|sd
Oh, I see.|bk
It's, it's investment property.|sd
I see.|b
But it is really, it's a very nice place.|sd
Uh, I, I would cheerfully live there.|sd
Of course it's not my home,|sd
and I've lived in my home in, well, almost ten years,|sd
and, you know, I've got everything just exactly like I want it.|sd
Right.|b
But if I were to live some place else, it certainly meets my standards.|sd
It's a nice house.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|b
that's a nice area.|sd
Is it on the golf course?|qy
No,|nn
it's not,|sd
it's off the golf course,|sd
and I'll be honest with you,|sd
I'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is.|sd
Is that right.|b
But it's in the estates that adjoin it.|sd
Yeah,|b
right,|b
right.|b
Well that's a nice area.|sd
Yes,|aa
it is.|sd
That really is a nice area.|sd
When they get that highway finished, you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go --|sd
Yeah,|b
that one nine --|sd
Right,|b
another belt line, just, uh, farther out.|sd
Right,|b
just continue to do that.|sd
Right,|b

Where are you from in California?|qw
Southern California.|sd
San Diego?|qy^d
I've lived in San Diego for six years when I was a ki-, younger, and L A area,|na
and my parents live in Anaheim right now.|sd
Lived up north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks area, where the Cowboys have their training camp, or used to anyway.|sd
I've been through all of that.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks, north of Los Angeles that is really an eerie, strange looking area --|sd
I won-, -|%
they're not really hills,|sd
they're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation.|sd
Huh.|b
I'm not familiar with what,|sd
is it along the coast or --|qy
Uh.|sd
That is one of the strangest areas I have ever seen.|sd
Um.|%
Uh, I had to go up to T I on business --|sd
Out there,|^2
uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we went up that coastline,|sd
and I was just amazed how unusual that looks.|sd
Huh.|b
Here, hang on just a second,|ad
I've got a Los Angeles map.|sd
Let me just quick -|oo_co_cc
Yeah,|b
valley.|^2
Yes --|aa
Okay,|b
I know where that is.|sd
-- beyond Thousand Oaks.|sd
I know where Valley is,|sd
I've been out there before,|sd
sure.|%
You don't think that's strange looking.|qy^d
I didn't notice anything strange, I guess --|ng
Oh, okay --|bk
-- maybe, maybe I'm used to Texas.|sd
Maybe Texas the way, -|sd
The elevation is extremely high.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's got curving roads on it,|sd
but, but the, -|%
it's just a strange landscape,|sd
there's very little vegetation.|sd
Huh.|b
I didn't, I don't remember seeing that part of it.|sd
I know Valley,|sd
yeah,|%
it's just a suburb of L A.|sd
Right.|b
It's a, -|%
And they've built some new highways out to that area, and things, lately.|sd
People can get in and out of L A easier.|sd
Maybe it's a place I went to,|sd
it was far extreme, thought we'd never find the place.|sd
Huh.|b
It was interesting.|sd
Yeah,|b
sounds interesting.|ba
Right.|b
Right,|b
right.|b
I, I know exactly that area.|h
It's a nice area out there.|sd
I love Thousand Oaks.|sd
Uh, Texas, I don't know,|h
thing, things, -|%
you just have less a variety, I guess.|sv
I think, I don't think it's quite as green, you know.|sv
It's green with all the trees and things out here|sd
but it's just, -|%
Oh, it's green sometime.|sd
Yeah,|b
but it's just, you know, -|%
I don't know.|h
Well, it doesn't stay green, you know --|sd
Right.|b
-- the really, -|%
and in all honesty, -|sd
I know this sounds like a Texas story,|sd
all honesty, you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years.|sd
We haven't had a --|sd
Yeah --|b
-- I missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one --|sd
Oh.|b
It may be eighty-two, because we bought our house in eighty-one|sd
and we built a pool in eighty-two,|sd
What's your favorite T V show?|qw
Oh. You know, I used to like ST. ELSEWHERE.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's one of my old favorites.|sd
Um, and that's, -|%
I'm being beeped,|sd
so I'll just ignore it.|sd
Um, and now, I, I did like THIRTY SOMETHING --|sd
Uh-huh.|b

my daughter says NINE OH TWO ONE OH.|sd
We like that one.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's one of my favorites.|sd
Good,|ba
and how old are you?|qw
I'm twenty-eight.|sd
Oh, so you're little bit younger than I am,|sd
but yeah,|b
I think if my seventeen year old, my fourteen year old, my other two children like it,|sd
I'm over forty,|sd
and I like it.|sd
I think it's wonderful.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's a good show.|sv
I like MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN, too.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
now see, I, we are so busy with, all of our kids are in sports,|sd
and I hardly ever watch T V,|sd
but that's one that, that we watch.|sd
And then Sunday nights we watch, uh, LIFE GOES ON.|sd
Yeah,|b
I like that,|sd
that's, that's a good show, too.|sv
Very good.|ba
Did you see the one on Sunday?|qy
Yes,|ny
it was a, uh, uh -|%
I did miss that Sunday,|sd
no|nn
I didn't.|sd
That one kid that Becca likes --|sd
Yeah,|b
it's a good episode.|sv
Yeah,|b
the, the new character on there did.|sd
Right,|b

All the way to North Carolina.|sd
What time is it there?|qw
Uh, it is twenty minutes to nine.|sd
Oh, my gosh.|ba
See, I'm twenty minutes to six here|sd
Three hours difference.|bf
Yeah,|aa

Okay.|b
What else do you like?|qw
Uh, let's see, I like a lot of different shows.|sd
Let's see, um, I like MURDER, SHE WROTE.|sd
That's, that's, -|%
Oh, I never, I never watched that ever in my entire life.|sd
And MATLOCK is another good one I watch.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, then during daytimes I like, I like ALL MY CHILDREN.|sd
A small bowl will be plenty.|t3
Oh, that's mine.|t3
That's the only one I watch whenever I, oh, -|sd
a small bowl will be better because it's pretty fattening.|t3
Talk to my daughter.|sd
Um, um,|%
ALL MY CHILDREN,|sd
I've watched that for about twelve years.|sd
Yeah,|b
I've, I'm sure I watched it for more than that probably.|sd
Twenty something.|sd
I used to watch GENERAL HOSPITAL when I was a teenager because I, -|sd
I quit watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed.|sd
Oh.|b
So that was a long time ago.|sd
I used to watch it, was in high school and college --|sd
Right.|b
She was my favorite character on there.|sd
I just, -|%
I read the reason she got, they, they killed her off was because they couldn't settle a contract,|sd
and I said, well, if they're going to do that to her, I won't watch it.|sd
Oh, that's great.|ba
Well, I do like ALL MY CHILDREN,|sd
and I, and I like it, you know, I don't know.|h
I just, -|%
I like the people on it, I guess, you know.|sd
I, I, I like it.|sd
I just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, Tad's going to come back, I bet, do you think?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I'm sure he will.|sd
He'll come back, show up at just the right moment.|sd
I kind of wish that, uh, Nina would come back because she --|sd
Oh.|b
just for a brief visit or whatever, because it never has been resolved with Palmer remarrying, and everything, -|sd
Yeah,|b
like Daisy, pops in once in a while,|sd
and, I forgot about Nina and Cliff, right.|sd
Yeah,|b
Cliff's on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS now.|sd
Oh, he is.|b
So he's out for good.|ba
Yeah,|aa
he's out for good.|sd
Did they marry?|qy
Uh --|%
Nina and Cliff?|qy^d
-- that's how they left the show, but not in real life.|sd
Um.|%
Now she's married to some guy in New York,|sd
and she's happily married|sd
and that's the reason she left the show.|sd
I guess she wanted a private life.|sd
Oh, okay,|b
oh, see I, I, I watch it maybe twice a month,|sd
so, I don't watch it everyday like I did when I had babies.|sd
Oh, well, I, I watch.|sd
Because I play lots of tennis|sd
and I'm gone a lot,|sd
so, I don't get to watch,|sd
I watch it everyday, religiously.|sd
I videotape it when I have to miss it.|sd
Oh, no kidding.|ba
Yeah.|aa
I use to be, I used to be like that|sd
I'm that way about a lot of different shows.|sd
I'm that way about MURPHY BROWN, DESIGNING WOMEN.|sd
Now isn't DESIGNING WOMEN, don't they have a new chick on there instead of the, instead of what's her name?|qy
Uh, yeah,|ny
there's two new characters on there.|sd
There's, um, uh, Jan Hooks from SATURDAY NIGHT LIFE.|sd
I don't know if you know her or not.|qy^d
Huh-uh.|ny
That's a show I like.|sd
And then, and then, uh, uh, the blond headed girl that used to be on NEWHART.|sd
Oh, yeah, oh.|ba
I don't like her on it,|sv
I never have liked her,|sv
so. -|%
Well, I, I just know which one she is.|sd
I don't, you know. -|%
She's taken the Suzanne's part,|sd
and then Jan Hooks has taken Charlene's part.|sd
Charlene was Delta Burke?|qy^d
Charlene was Jean Smart, the blond headed.|ng
Oh, okay,|bk
well, see, I never watch that one either.|sd
I really don't watch a whole lot of T V, just, you know, on Sunday nights,|sd
LIFE GOES ON comes on about the time that we eat dinner,|sd
and my whole family's home, because I don't allow the kids out on Sunday night --|sd
Yeah.|b
and so we, we sit around and eat popcorn|sd
and, oh, then we watch AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS.|sd
Those are always pretty cute.|sv
Well, MURDER, SHE WROTE comes on opposite of that,|sd
and so, -|%
Oh, so you don't watch that one --|qy^d
Yeah|ny
I --|sd
but --|sd
Sure.|b
Yeah,|b
we like that real well.|sd
It, -|%
be sure to watch it tomorrow night --|ad
Uh-huh.|b
I know.|sd
The kids already know who it is,|sd
I don't know who it is, though,|sd
Who is it?|qw
Ask them|ad
Let me ask Nicole.|oo_co_cc
to someone in Nicole. -|t3
What?|br
Do you want to start?|qy
Uh, you hit, you hit, uh, -|sd
it doesn't matter.|sd
Um, we're discussing the capital punishment, I believe.|sd
Right.|b
You are right.|sd
Yeah.|%
I, I suppose I should have,|sv
Uh, which -|%
I am, am pro capital punishment except that I don't like the way it's done.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, yeah,|^h
uh, I, uh, I guess, I, I hate to see anyone die, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, uh, I guess these people that go around and, and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse, uh, I don't think they deserve to, to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives.|sv
I, I agree.|aa
I, I'm, -|%
capital -|%
the, the, -|%
capital punishment is necessary in, in many cases|sv
but, uh, the, -|%
it's not a deterrent, um, or our jails would not be so full.|sv
There wouldn't be so many people in Death Row.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think it needs to be something, uh, uh, a throwback to where they did a, uh, public execution where it's visible.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh, something, you know, not gruesome|sv
but, but something more where people know that it, it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people.|sv
If you committed a certain crime, you were going to receive a death penalty|sv
and it was going to happen to you.|sv
Yeah.|b
No stays of execution.|sv
No, no loopholes,|sv
no, -|%
Well, and even, even that I don't really know if that would help.|sv
I think a lot of these people do it, uh, mainly because of, of T V|sv
and, a-, -|%
Notoriety.|bf
the double reason ma-, they, they see it being done on T V and also the fact of, of notoriety.|sv
I mean, they become well known.|sv
They are almost like, like a big star.|sv
Ye-, yes,|b
but, but they, they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal.|sv
Yeah.|b
They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That they are going to write a book.|sv
They are going to go on talk shows|sv
they're goin-, -|%
that, that, that's a reward --|sv
Yeah.|b
Right.|b
In, in complete, uh, -|%
of any notoriety. -|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, I, I, I think if they went according to, uh, the BIBLE where it does say,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
uh, you take a life you give yours.|sv
Right.|b
Uh, uh, that's for sure.|ba
Uh, there's exceptions to the rule|sv
I mean if, if it's an accidental taking then, uh, you look at that|sv
but, you know, most of these people that down right go right and, and do it out of pure pleasure --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent, -|sv
it is a deterrent in the, in the sense that that person will never do it again|sv
Well, yes,|ar
they will.|sd
Not,|sv
It, -|%
Oh, ,|b
well, that's correct,|ba
yes.|b
Ye-, if, if he indeed receives --|sv
The death penalty.|b^m
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
But, but the, the, the chances are not great that that will happen.|sv
Right.|b
But there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
Well, I, I guess I'm also looking at beyond even that.|sd
I, I, I guess I been thinking about it|sd
and I don't have a definite opinion|sd
but, uh, repeat, uh, crimes --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
That's right.|ba
Just for pleasure too|^2
and --|sv
Yes.|aa
Do they deserve to, uh, remain on this earth too?|bh
Why, you know, y-, y-, you could carry it to that if, uh, if they are a repeat offender|sv
and, and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this.|sv
Unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up, um, you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes,|sv
Right.|b
and of course uh, of battery or assault or, that is not a capital crime see.|sd
You, you wouldn't be able to under our system.|sd
Right.|b
Now China and a few other countries have a little different view of that.|sv
Um, you get caught with dope there and you die, period.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
There is, there is no, no appeals.|sv
There is no, -|%
Well, how do you feel about capital punishment?|qo
Well, I, I just last Friday got off a capital murder case.|sd
Oh, you did?|bh
Yeah,|ny
I was on the jury. Uh,|sd
Wow.|ba
Yeah|b
Which is funny because I got called last night -|sd
and the topic was, uh, something about juries|sd
Oh, really|bh
Yeah,|ny
so I am just hitting it right.|sd
Uh, how do I feel about it?|qo
I, I don't know.|h
Well, I guess it is right in certain cases. Uh,|sv
Yeah.|b
Becau-, -|%
well, the one I was just on, I don't, -|sd
I was an alternate on the case,|sd
so I don't know what was decided.|sd
Right.|b
They are probably still in deliberations on it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, what I found out, -|sd
once, once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed, we met with the judge, the two alternates did.|sd
Right.|b
And, uh, he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy|sd
and I remember hearing about it.|sd
It was about a year ago.|sd
Uh, he was, he was involved in another one, another capital murder the very next month|sd
and he was caught just, -|sd
they, they drove up,|sd
the police drove up just as he fired the g-, gun and killed the guy.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
So he was caught|sd
and, uh, it's interesting because the county I live in, -|sd
I'm not in Dallas county,|sd
I'm, I'm pretty far north of Dallas.|sd
Okay.|b
Uh, county I live in, in the past ten years only had t-, two capital murders.|sd
Wow.|ba
And last year there were six|sd
and this guy is indicted on three of them.|sd
Really?|bh
Yeah,|ny
so --|sv
Wow|ba
Yeah,|b
well, the cases like that, they --|sv
Yeah.|b
I mean, if he's going to be drastic, somebody has to be drastic back.|sv
Yeah,|b
although, you know, it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him.|sv
You know, he, he has no concept of what he has done.|sv
Really?|bh
He just, well, -|%
from what I can tell. I mean, I didn't talk to the guy or anything,|sd
but --|sd
Right.|b
Wow.|ba
So, it's, it's kind of strange that, you know, -|sv
Uh-huh.|b
No, no remorse whatsoever, huh.|qy
No,|nn
huh-uh.|nn
Well, I guess in cases like that, you know, where the guy would, obviously, go out and do it again --|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
well, it's funny because when, you know, they interview you before you go on the jury --|sd
Right.|b
Wow.|ba
And I, -|%
the, -|%
I was the, I think the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed.|sd
You're kidding.|ba
But, you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone|sd
and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt|sd
and I said I can't imagine,|sd
I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it, yeah,|sd
I guess I could convict him,|sd
but I can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something.|sd
Right.|b
But they really did.|sd
It was, it was --|sd
Really?|bh
Well, I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun, -|sd
Well, that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
But this particular case, I mean, they had a complete confession from the guy --|sd
Okay.|b
so no one else would have known.|sd
Oh.|b
It was, it was really pretty interesting.|sd
Wow.|ba
What, -|%
Educational.|sd
I guess cases like that, I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case.|sd
Well, they can't, they can, I think in the punishment phase --|sd
Okay.|b
Of that crime --|^2
Right.|b
-- but he was found guilty of anoth-,|sd
okay.|b
Right,|b
so --|sd
That works.|^2
Right.|b
So, -|%
Well, they pushing the death penalty?|qy
Uh, yeah,|ny
this guy is up for the death penalty.|sd
Wow.|ba
Uh, and in Texas there is, there is a couple of questions you have to ask, uh, in the punishment phase.|sd
Uh, for example, was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation|sd
And there is a number of questions|sd
and just depending on whether you say yes or no, uh, you, you can give him capital punishment|sd
and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment, then you can look at mitigating circumstances.|sd
Okay.|b
So, -|%
So there is a lot of outs,|sd
but the only result is, otherwise he gets life in prison.|sd
Yeah,|b
and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway --|sv
Yeah|b
Right,|b
and, and to me, I mean, you take away a person's freedom, you've taken away most of their life.|sv
That's true.|ba
I mean, if you're going to put him in prison for life --|sv
Yeah,|b
but, -|%
But then you have to look at reality.|sd
I mean, I think, you know, normally they, they may get out|sv
so, -|%
That's true.|ba
But what is it worth?|bh
I don't know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Personally I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself.|sv
That's true.|ba
I mean, I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not|sv
or, -|%
Yeah,|b
so, you said you're from Mississippi?|bf
Yes, ma'am.|ny
And do they have the death penalty there?|qy
Yes,|ny
they do.|sd
I, -|%
they've had a, a number of cases here.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, not a whole lot,|sd
well, Jackson, I heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It was like last like year they had forty-nine|sd
so that's going up.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
they have a death penalty.|sd
I hear of one every now and then.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I visited the prison up here --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I've been, -|%
I haven't, -|%
they won't let you on death row,|sd
but they'll let you look down the hall.|sd
You can't see any prisoners|sd
and, and it's kind of a weird feeling.|sd
I've been -- -|%
-- they took us around on a tour, you know,|sd
and I went, got to walk in the gas chamber --|sd
Ooh.|ba
-- and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying, like, people have died here.|sd
That's right.|ba
But I guess, just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff, the people up there, -|sd
Well, uh, let's see,|^2
what type of car do I want?|^2
Well, I'd like to have a Corvette.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
But my, uh, weekly wages don't apply for me to have that kind of car,|sd
so -- -|%
Yeah.|b
-- uh, I'm engaged to get married|sd
so, I'll more likely get a car for economic reasons.|sd
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
and, uh, so, uh, to drive back and forth to work is all I'll need a car for pretty much.|sd
And we have a truck,|sd
so probably a economic size car or, uh, -|sd
What kind of a car do you have now?|qw
Right now I have a eighty-seven Cavalier.|sd
It's a piece of -|sd
My car is really old, too,|sd
because, uh, I drive out of town a lot of the weekends --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I would like my next car to have good gas mileage.|sd

Uh-huh,|b
oh, yeah,|b
I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in,|sd
you know, it's like, wow|sd
Yeah.|b
That works,|ba
I'll go do that|sd
I, -|%
And boy that thing screams now.|sd
Yeah,|b
I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed,|sd
That wasn't alive for but maybe two years.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars.|sd
Is that right?|bh
That's it?|bh
Yeah,|ny
it, when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.|sd
I'll be darned.|ba
Yeah.|b
Huh, well, -|%
you've done. -|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Our most recent series of projects I guess, was, inside was, uh, we remodeled a bathroom recently.|sd
Well, how did it go?|qo
Well, it went pretty well, uh, other than the fact that we encountered some, uh, problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another,|sd
and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain.|sd
Gee, like starting over, I guess.|ba
Uh.|%
It wasn't one of those, -|sd
it started out as a Sunday project --|sd
Uh-huh|b
-- and by, by the next Sunday it was done.|sd
It wasn't a one dayer.|sd
Believe me.|ad
Boy, that sounds like, uh, -|%
course, uh, I don't know,|h
once you get it done, then you probably won't have that problem again.|sv
Yeah,|b
it's good for another thirty years.|sd
Um, you've got an older house?|qy^d
Yes.|ny
They are built a little bit more sturdy than -|sv
Well, that's the thing that surprised me, because once I got into the plumbing --|sd
Right.|b
and it was all soldered.|sd
Oh, is that right.|ba
That's what drove me bananas, because, you know, I'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and --|sd
Yes.|b
and nothing wanted to go,|sd
so it was like I had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over.|sd
And just start at square one.|^2
Really.|b
Uh.|%
That was an all day job, just to get it plumbed.|sd
Well, and then if you do it wrong -|sv
Fortunately, I was very fortunate, uh, in the fact that, uh, when I made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on --|sd
Everything went all right.|^2
everything worked.|sd
And I just said, that's marvelous.|sd
I appreciate it.|sd
That's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens.|sv
Well, I expected something to leak, you know --|sd
Right.|b
Yes.|b
Right.|b
But it all came together,|sd
so I, I felt pretty fortunate about that.|sd
All worked out all right, huh.|bf
How about you?|qo
Well, um, well probably the last thing I did was, uh, paint and wallpaper kids room --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I learned to, -|sd
I used the wrong kind of paint.|sd
This wasn't, must have not been a very good quality, because it just hasn't stood up very well.|sd
What kind of paint?|qw
It was a latex paint, paint,|sd
it was flat --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I wonder if maybe I should have used a gloss.|sd
Uh, but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your --|sd
Yeah,|b
that, and semigloss for trim work, and usually flat for walls.|^2
Yeah,|ny
but I think maybe, uh, -|%
I don't know if it was just the. -|sv
Was it not washable paint?|qy
Well, it, it is a latex paint,|no
but it just kind of is, is, -|%
so, you know, so it's supposed to wash, you're supposed to be able to wash it --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but it, um, just looks dingy.|sd
I don't know how else to explain it.|sd
What color is it?|qw
It's pink.|sd
Pink,|b^m
okay.|bk
It's kind of got, uh, oh, just kind of a worn look to it.|sd
I don't know even how to say, -|sd
just didn't turn out quite as nice as I would have liked|sd
but, -|%
Did you, uh, require more than one can of paint?|qy
I, we put two coats on it,|sd
and it's a small room,|sd
but I think it only took one, uh, can.|sd
You didn't have to mix paint then, right.|qy
No.|nn
Okay.|bk
We did, uh, oh, -|%
you do mix the color as far as you start with, uh, white|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
You know what I'm saying|qy^d
but, -|%
Yeah.|ny
But you only had one can of paint that you --|qy^d
Yes.|ny
Right.|b
And then I wall papered a couple of walls,|sd
and, uh. -|%
How'd that go?|qw
Well, that was the first time I've ever wallpapered,|sd
and, uh, -|%
Kind of fun, isn't it.|qy
That's an education in itself.|no
Really.|b
But, uh, the dye lots, uh, must have been a little bit different from, -|sd
first of all it takes quite a few rolls, even a small room, if you're trying to match a design.|sd
Repeating patterns is what you have to check for --|sd
Yes.|b
That's what I needed,|sd
and I didn't think about that.|sd
I got a Mickey Mouse print is what I got.|sd
Yeah.|b
And so a lot is wasted.|sd
Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats.|sd
So you know how. -|sd
See, I didn't even think to look for that.|sd
Yeah.|b
And then the, -|%
one of them was just a different color, different color pink, is what it ended up being.|sd
Um.|%
And . -|%
When you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall?|qy
No|nn
I didn't.|sd
Or did you start at the edge?|qrr
Is that how you're supposed to do?|qy
I started at one edge and went over,|sd
then you had to cut around the closet --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, uh, -|%
I've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall,|sd
and I'll start with a plumb line.|sd
And start right there. -|bf
Do you seem to get it straighter,|qy
is that the advantage,|qy
or what's the, -|qrr
Well, you, you, -|%
So. How's your products been?|qo
Um, I really haven't had, uh, too many problems.|sd
Uh, seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out.|sd
I hear that one.|ba
Have you had any lately go out?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three,|sd
and they, -|%
unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time, when I bought my new house,|sd
and, uh, I really don't have any recourse,|sd
so I had to call and have them all repaired and that.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
Yeah,|b
it was a hassle.|sd
So you didn't get anything,|qy^d
even, all the, all the warranties were out?|qy
Yeah,|ny
the warranty on the refrigerator, uh, -|sd
the i-, -|%
the refrigerator warranty's still good,|sd
but the ice maker itself, passed its three years,|sd
and it was three years and two months.|sd
You're kidding.|ba
No.|nn
Yeah,|b
we just moved into a new house, too,|sd
so we had to buy all those, too.|sd
Uh, watch out.|ad
Yeah,|aa
the only thing I've had problems with is, um, -|sd
I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such,|sd
and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings.|sd
So. -|%
Um.|%
I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than, -|sd
I just ended up using it.|sd
But, that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong.|sd
But. -|%
I usually have pretty good luck with appliances,|sd
but I just, uh, -|%
it was within two days that all three of these stopped working,|sd
and the --|sd
That's incredible.|ba
and the, uh, microwave had to have, uh, some kind of something I can't even pronounce,|sd
and they, uh, -|%
the dryer had to have a new heating element,|sd
so it was about, almost three hundred dollars for all three of them.|sd
And they all went out at the same time?|qy^d
Uh, within two days of each other.|na
Or two days.|b^m
Wow.|ba
I was, -|%
it wasn't a good week.|sd
I was pretty mad.|sd
And plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business,|sd
so even if I, I think even if I had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that manufactured,|sd
but still they were through that retailer,|sd
so I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not.|sd
Wow,|ba
it's frustrating.|sd
But I didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty.|sd
So. It was a call to the local appliance dealer --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but, I, -|%
the only other things that I've ever had trouble with, uh, -|sd
I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers, blow dryers.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
they go out a lot?|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
I've had two or three of those go out.|sd
One was under warranty,|sd
and the other two weren't,|sd
but, I just, -|%
other than that, you know, T V -s and things like that, I haven't ever had any trouble with.|sd
I don't think products are getting much better though.|sv
Yeah.|aa
See I'm in the manufacturing -|sd
home from work -|sd
and make, um, automotive air bags, the safety air bags. -|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah.|ny
That's interesting.|ba
At Morton International, -|sd
and, I thin-, -|%
well, it's, it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment.|sd
We test everything after each assembly process,|sd
and so our testing is pretty thorough,|sd
but. -|%
Do you, do you test each individual one --|qy
Um.|%
-- or do you just test, -|qrr
like if you've got ten, you test one,|qy^d
and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay?|qy^d
Um, the tests that, -|no
well, we test every one electrically.|na
We don't, -|%
I think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, but we do test after, during the assembly project, product, um, after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check to make sure it's there after we install it,|sd
so, each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done,|sd
and then we do electrical tests on them during the process,|sd
so. -|%
Well, that's something I've never had to use,|sd
it's never, I've never been involved in an automobile accident,|sd
so, luckily that's a product that I haven't had to test.|sd
Yeah.|b
But I think it's a great idea.|sd
I'm, I'm, -|%
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about|sd
but that. -|%
Well, they do the, all the testing that we have to do through the government,|sd
it's incredible how much testing they have to do.|sd
Oh, I'm sure they want to be thorough before they. -|sv

Uh-huh.|b
I'm not a real big seat belt, -|sd

Well Jackie, uh, on taxes, I, I guess I would have to say, that I, that my opinion is that I do think Americans are paying too much in taxes.|sv

I agree.|aa
I think taxes are high.|sv
Right,|b
uh, where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both?|qy
Oh, yes.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, uh-huh.|bk
In New Hampshire we have, uh, uh, no, no, what we call broad base taxes.|sd
No income tax and no sales tax.|sd
Huh.|b
Uh, we tax business, uh, eight percent,|sd
businesses are taxed eight percent|sd
and we have what we call the five B s. Uh, th-, for our taxes. Booze, uh, butts, cigarettes, beds, uh, hotel room tax --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
So, uh, we do have a very low tax rate,|sd
but you know, combined with the federal income tax. I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes|sv
and . -|%
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
I, I agree|aa
and I, think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting, -|sv
well if you do get money back from like jobs, -|sv
I'm still a student --|sd
Uh-huh|b
so I, I get a check back|sd
so -- -|%
Well that's nice.|ba
-- from, from taxes -|sd
but, -|%
Nice, nice to get a refund.|sv
Yeah|aa
It is,|sv
but it's not much.|sd
So. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Do you think that, uh, for whatever taxes we do pay that, uh, we are getting value for it?|qy
No.|nn
Yeah.|aa
Uh, my, my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state|sv
and they say they are going to send some back,|sv
it's like giving yourself a tra-, it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion.|sv
Yeah.|b
You know what I mean?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Uh, it, it really, uh, -|%
I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because,|sv
Yeah.|b
There you go|ba
and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first|sv
and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol, uh, a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you.|sv
Right,|b
yeah.|b
I don't know.|h
I, -|%
don't seem like they are doing much with it,|sv
I mean there's plans there|sv
and now that they are voting and people, you know, getting into drug and that stuff.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
They have nice plans|sv
and, uh, but, they don't always work|sv
and then you know they try to raise taxes more|sv
and I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work, -|sv
you know, but taxes get raise|sd
so. I don't know.|h
I'm not really into politics, uh --|sd
That it, -|%
-- I don't really understand it --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but it's just you know -|%
Well, it does it, it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend.|sv
Uh, it's almost like they will spend as much as the, they're allowed to collect. You know.|sv
Right.|b
Uh, there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. Uh, ten percent or thirteen percent.|sd
There would be no figuring.|sd
I mean you would take your income tax, -|sd
you would have a certain amount, -|sd
I mean you would take you total salary --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes,|sd
and then there would be a set amount for however many people, you know, dependent you have,|sd
and you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions, no deductions or anything else after you know, after you figure up who's in your family.|sd
Right.|b
Huh.|b
And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S|sv
and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with.|sv
Yeah.|b
The could be nice|ba
Yeah.|b
Huh.|b
I, I'd like to see something like that.|sv
I think it would be fairer|sv
and it would put a, you know, a lot of the tax attorneys our of business|sv
and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail,|sv
but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans.|sv
Right,|b
yeah.|b
I mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.|sd
Right,|b
huh.|b
It doesn't seem fair to me.|sd
Yeah,|aa
it isn't,|sv
there is not much out there that is fair,|sv
that's for sure.|sv

Uh-huh.|b

Uh-huh.|b
I just thought that was really that's kind of cold,|sv
Oh yeah,|b
I have seen that happen lots of times.|sd
You know, uh, Channel X gives you the best coverage|sd

Uh-huh.|b
They are trying to get the, you know, most emotional response for, -|sv
Yeah,|aa
it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story,|sd

Uh, you know, it, it just seemed to lack any sort of debate.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh, you know, not saying that we shou-, that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there,|h
but it just seemed like, you know. -|sv
They kept just showing, you know, how great we were doing|sv
and it never really showed what actually --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the, you know, the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they kind of you know, -|%
if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who --|qh

Well, I mostly listen to popular music.|sd
I, uh, listen to it all the time in, in my car,|sd
so, I, I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because I don't like commercials.|sd
But,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, uh, quite honestly, I, I have some little children|sd
and I, unfortunately, found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately,|sd

so I switch quite often.|sd
Um, I think I like, -|sd
I, I'm really particular about the type of music that I listen to.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, the, uh, -|%
there's such a wide selection,|sd
I think I like a lot, I like a little bit of a lot of different types of music.|sd
You know, I, I, I like music that is, that I feel -|sd
if it is performed correctly or if it's done right, or if the version is done right, I like it|sd
Yeah.|b
but, if, if it's not, then I won't.|sd
I, I really don't, -|sd
How do you feel about rap music?|qo
Rap.|b^m
It seems to be so popular these days.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, I, I don't really have anything against rap music.|sd
I, -|%
the one thing I do object to about rap music is, is when it becomes militant,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
I, I have strong objections to that.|sd
Um, actually I listen to, -|sd
one time I remember, this was back when, even, uh, -|sd
I would say about ten or fifteen years ago I, -|sd
When it was really just starting.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
right|b
when it was just starting,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, it was about, -|sd
the, the piece of music, the piece of music was about, I think about forty or fifty years old.|sd
And, it was incredible, I mean, the parallel, you know, between it and rap.|sd
Right.|b
And, um, you, you listen a lot, -|sv
if you, if you hear a lot of old gospel, uh, uh, especially well, the black gospel.|sv
You know, you will, you know, you can really pick it up. I mean,|sv
Yeah,|b
you really. -|%
It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music.|sv
A lot of times you'll hear songs that you know, they're not original,|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, sounds, it sounds so much different|sv
and yet, I, I have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music|sd
and, uh, she thinks its pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she's listening to,|sd
and yet,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
they, they do, they do copy versions, they do cover versions of, of, you know, like standards, I guess you could call it.|sd
That's right.|ba
I think it's kind of absurd, you know, the fact that, you know, they don't really, they don't really give, you know, the original artist, or the original composer,|sv
No.|aa
Yeah,|b
I guess there was even a, a bit of ruckus caused by the M C Hammer, who's really, you know,|sv
Yeah.|b
seems to be the hot one of, of today.|sv
He used, um, WILD THING.|sd
Do you remember that, that song.|qy
Yeah.|ny
he used, um, -|sd
I can't remember who the artist was on that.|sd
Jimi Hendrix was the original.|sd
Who?|br
Jimi Hendrix was the original.|sd
He wrote -|sd
Was it, -|qy
well, ma-, maybe it wasn't that one.|sd
Because, it was a living, it was a living person that I'm, I'm thinking of that,|sd
Okay.|b
And, uh, I guess that they, because they hadn't originally gotten, um, permission,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, he, he since then has, has amended that, and paid them his royalties every time the, the song goes on|sd
but, -|%
Yeah.|b
I don't know|h
it may have, it may have been somebody else, because I think, I think that even Jimi Hendrix did it,|sd
I think that was a cov-, -|sd
you know, come to think of it, I think that was a cover version of, like a John Lee Hooker song, or something,|sd
Maybe so.|ba
I,|h
I mean it was just like, -|sd
it was really old.|sd
I mean I, I, -|%
there are a lot, there are so many different songs,|sd
I mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times. I mean I've heard some songs that, that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of, -|sd
I'm like, you know, I, I don't want to listen to this.|sd
Yeah.|b
you know, oh, that was really great.|^q
That was a, you know, a really good piece of work,|^q
and then when you hear the cover it's like, you know, God, what are they doing.|sv
Right.|b
They destroyed it.|sv
I, I think a good one was, um, -|sv
there was a Peter Frampton song,|sd
Oh, yeah!|ba
and, then the cover version, I think, I mean, I thought, was absolutely, it was pitiful.|sv
I, I remember seeing the video of it on M T V,|sd
and I thought it was hideous.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I did too.|sv
It was, -|%
ugh, I didn't like that either.|sv
Yeah,|b
but you know, whatever became of Peter Frampton.|qw^d
I mean, there was nothing, -|sv
he was a phenomenon,|sv
I me-, there was no reason for him to really come into, you know, great stardom or anything.|sv
I remember, I saw him in a concert, when I was, -|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I think, I think it, -|%
I think it was in high school.|sd
Yeah,|b
I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
He was very good.|sv
I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in, uh, Philadelphia.|sd
It was in J F K Stadium, if I can remember.|sd
Oh man.|ba
Hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like.|sd

I've, I graduated back in seventy-nine,|sd
so, -|%
Um, um. Uh-huh.|b
but, but I've really, -|%
I, I loved, -|sd
I mean, I was, I was really into the album oriented music, even then,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so I was really familiar with a lot, with a lot of, of the A O R type music.|sd
Um, the album oriented like the, uh, James Taylor,|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
and you know, I mean, a lot of people they go, they're better than the Beatles,|sd
and I'm like, you know,|sd
No|aa
I mean, the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles It was just, -|sv
You can only laugh|sv
Yeah,|b
you just sort of, -|%
you know, well I guess I can just humor them, you know At this point.|sv
Right|b
well, they, -|%
I guess our age is showing when, we, we think that.|sv
Yeah,|b
but well, you know, I, I, I've liked a lot of the new music.|sd
I think, um,|%
Uh-huh.|b
I saw some promise, you know, with, with a lot of the new wave, when it, when it came out, uh,|sd
Yeah.|b
And then, um, I don't know|h
music is kind of in a weird, it's in a very weird position right now.|sv
I think that, -|%
I mean, I like, you know, things like to hear, you know, what they call world music. Which is, you know, using all these natural forms of music|sv
and, -|%
Like Paul Simon.|qy^d
Like, -|%
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
Paul Simon.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, you know, really that's not world music.|sv
But, what, what Paul Simon's doing, I think is, is, is great because he's, you know I think, I think that using, I guess what they call it is eclectic, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
What do you mean by world music?|qw
Well, world music is, um, -|sd
a lot of the, a lot of where they, where they make music that they adapt to a, to another kind of, to another type of listener.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, for example, let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of music and, with a certain style,|sd
and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for, let's say another audience, let's say a North American.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, then when they hear it, it, it's a really, it's another form of music, and,|sd
Um.|b
The, the best of every type of music.|sd
Right.|b
Because, I mean, there are some, I mean, -|%
I, I li-, -|%
there are some, you know, types of heavy metal that I really like,|sd
but, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that I, I completely like heavy metal.|sd
No.|aa
I, I think, -|%
you know, and it's the same way with, -|sd
you know, world music takes the forms that have really been, um, -|sd
I guess, I -|%
you know, the best example or, you know, the cream of the crop, I guess you could say, -|sd
and then, and then taking those, those qualities, and then applying, in the styles, that are really, um, that are extremely enjoyable, and then taking, -|sd
So then it becomes a kind of music of, of its own, so to speak,|qy^d
or, uh, -|%
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
it becomes a kind of music of its own.|sd
I mean, when you listen to it, it's um, uh, -|sv
I think that they don't use, elec-, -|sv
some of it, -|sv
it's, -|%
they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
so, you know, well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now, and from West Africa, that's considered world music, because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles.|sd
Right.|b
But, they're, they're trying to make it somewhat more modern.|sd
I, I, I, -|%
a good, another good example was I heard Miles Davis,|sd
and Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh|b
You know, he's a jazz performer,|sd
and then he's playing with Robbie Shoncar,|sd
who's a very good, he's a very good arranger.|sd
Uh, arrangement to, uh, -|sd
we're going to have to get off.|ad
The, -|%
are they trying to , -|qy
I don't know.|no
But, uh, -|%
We've talked our five minutes though.|sd
Yeah,|b
okay,|b
but, I mean, when I heard his album, I heard it and it was just incredible.|sd
I've been listening to that a lot lately.|sd
Yeah,|b
I, I listened -|sd
and, I heard, -|sd
you know, you hear this guitar,|sd
and then you hear the muted trumpet.|sd
I -|%
me, -|%
and you never would think that they, that they can actually play together|sv
but, -|%
Oh yeah.|b
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I don't know,|sd
which end do we push|qw
but okay,|%
Okay,|b
well, um, let's see,|^h
I, I think there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their, their, uh, opinion is going to be heard|sv
and, you know, there's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States|sv
and that, you know, -|%
their, yo-, vote's not going to make that much difference|sv
and whether you vote for one person or the other person, the issues is what, you know, what you believe in,|sv
and that person is going to have a lot of, uh, -|sv
since there's so many issues, this one person can believe a lot of different ways on,|sv
Right,|b
yeah.|b
so, it would be really difficult to have that one pers-, perfect person that believed exactly what you believed.|sv
That's true,|ba
you know, a lot of people, uh, uh, -|%
I think the, that it ends up the people that, uh, vote every time, uh, elections come around are more the, the polly, uh, the party type followers, the guys that, uh, you know, follow the party lines, you know,|sv
and,|sv
Yeah.|b
and if they're Republican they vo-, vote Republican every year, you know,|sv
and, uh, the people that are independent, you know, are the ones that don't, uh, don't really, uh, show up every year because they can't seem to, to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate.|sv
Right,|b
yeah,|b
Yeah.|b
that's good.|ba
Ye-, -|%
I always thought -|%
it was back when Anderson was running, I was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes,|sd
but, um|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
there's, uh, a lot of extremes on the parties, too, with the you know, the real, uh, far side of the Democrats|sd
they're real liberal now and to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago, um, the Democrat party being liberal like they are now, you know, would never be thought of,|sd
it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like, uh, moral standings and those kinds of things.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, -|%
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
that's, uh, -|%
and then, and then people always get upset about it, too, because, you know, every year the, the, the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote,|sv
Uh-huh|b
they, they each think that, uh, if more people vote, they'll get more votes, huh?|qy
Yeah|ny
I'm always amazed at that, that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
That's, that's true.|ba
I think in, uh, the Texas governor elections, I think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody, this time.|sv
Yeah,|b
well, that, uh, -|%
I know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a pr-, pr-, predominately Catholic type area,|sd
Oh, really?|bh
and when things start, uh, -|sd
when, when abortion comes on the issues and people just get all insp-, inspired, you know, -|sd
Right.|b
and, uh, still on the other hand we're also, uh, -|sd
this particular community is a Catholic community|sd
but, uh, uh, down in D C where, where things are a little bit different, uh, you know, it's, it's women's rights and the, and that sort of movement,|sd
and so it's, uh, quite the opposite,|sd
so elections start getting very, uh, -|sd
the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's true.|ba
But, uh, -|%
Yeah,|b
that's true that the different places in America that, uh, you know, different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place.|sd
Yeah,|b
I can understand why, why some of the, the rural areas, the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for the, the Midwest,|sd
Uh-huh|b
and, uh, it doesn't matter who they put in office, they're going to fall subject to, uh, the pressure that the lobbyists can put,|sv
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
and it's, uh, real true that, uh, you know, they'll say one thing,|sv
and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand.|sv
Right.|b
You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing.|sv
You know, that's, uh, -|%
with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous --|sv
Yeah|b
Yeah.|b
Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year.|sv
I think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected.|sv
Right|b
Uh,|%
Right,|b
after the war.|^2
Uh-huh.|b
That really, uh, -|%
Unfortunately that will probably even drop lower, the voters turndown, even more because more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot|sv
so they won't even bother turning out.|sv
Uh, that's true,|ba
yeah.|b
They'll just say, oh, well, you know, the Republicans have this election|sv
we'll see you in four years.|^q
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
hope some of the local, -|sd
well that's what they, they keep saying that it seems like people with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the, at the booths,|sd
they, they say that these older voters that, uh, you know, they, they feel like the kids are running the, the country|sd
so they, they don't come out, turn out to vote|sd
and they're the ones that, uh, you know, really know what's going on, have the experience and seen, you know, how politicians can, you know, screwup or what ever.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, I know, my grandmother hasn't voted in years.|sd
Right,|b
that's, -|%
you know, neither has mine as a matter of fact.|sd
And, uh, that's true,|sv
they, I think they look at it as, well everybody, the majority of the people think this way, when that's not necessarily true,|sv
Well, the majority believes this way|sv
so, uh, they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their, uh, opinions.|sv
So that's, that's true.|sv
Yeah,|b
wonder if they're going to take into account this computerized conversation that there's little children, you know, bouncing in your knee,|sd
Yeah.|b

It was, it was a big western,|sd
I mean, I think Roseanne Arquett was in it too, another one that if you blink you'd miss her.|sd
Uh, it was, -|%
and I think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours,|sd
and, and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out.|sd
Oh, really.|b
Um, but it was, it was really good Um,|sv
I, I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although I wo-, I would remember, I think in, with him in it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
How about REVENGE,|qo
did you see that with him?|qy
No,|nn
I didn't,|sd
is that any good?|qy
With, uh, Anthony Quinn.|sd
I thought it was,|na
I like everything he's done so far.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
You know, it's, uh, one of those movies that it's not a great movie|sv

Yeah,|b
we were in the video store today|sd

Tha-, -|%
in fact, that was advertised not too long ago.|sd
Yeah,|b
it was on, um, -|%
Cable?|qy^d
no,|nn
it was on one of the networks, I think last weekend.|sd
Okay,|bk
I know I saw, yeah, something about it.|sd
Yeah,|b
I, um, I wish, I, I mean I'd seen it when, when, you know, it was originally in the theaters|sd
and, um, I saw it, you know, I saw part of it again.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean I like, you know, I like Costner,|sd
I like Sean Connery,|sd
and, uh, there's this one, there's this one actor,|sd
it's really silly that I enjoy him a lot|sd
but I, I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in, a guy named Charles Martin Smith.|sd
I don't know him.|sd
Um, you've probably seen him|sd
and just, an, -|%
you know, oh, that's who the guy is.|sd
Do you remember, -|qy
did you ever see AMERICAN GRAFFITI?|qy
No,|nn
I, I don't think so.|sd

He was in the UNTOUCHABLES.|sd
He was the accountant|sd
Oh, oh I know who you mean.|sd
Yeah.|b
He was in, uh, uh, HONEY DON'T SHRINK THE KIDS, wasn't he?|qy
No,|nn
no,|nn
you're thinking of Rick Moranis.|sv
He looks like Rick Moranis|sd
but he's not|sd
Oh, okay,|bk
se-, -|%
all right,|b
yeah,|b
that's the one I was thinking of.|sd
But I have, I've seen quite a few movies,|sd
I, I enjoy them.|sd
I think that, uh, it's, it's kind of like, uh, good entertainment.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
How about some of the ads,|qo
do you go by the ads when you look at them, or the reviews?|qy
Do they influence you a lot.|qy^d
Uh, a little of, -|na
e-, -|%
e-, -|%
a review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see.|sd
Yeah.|b
Did you see GOODFELLAS?|qy
No,|nn
it's o-, uh, -|%
I want to see it.|sd
That wa-, that was pretty good.|sv
Um, and, -|%
Um, we want to see GODFATHER PART THREE also|sd
but my, my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but I've never seen either of the first, you know, of the, of the GODFATHER movies|sd
so, we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see GODFATHER PART THREE somewhere.|sd
I was just going to say, th-, you should see those, fi-, uh, first if you can.|sv
Yeah.|b
If y-, if you read the book it's, uh, even better.|sv
The book was excellent.|sv
Oh, okay,|b
I haven't,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, uh, I was a little disappointed in the third on-, -|sd
it's GODFATHER THREE.|sd
It was not bad|sv
but, I expected more, I think.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We just rented, um, a couple weeks ago, a movie called THE FRESHMAN,|sd
with, um, -|%
it's got Matthew Broderick in it and, um, uh, Marlon Brando.|sd
And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in THE GODFATHER.|sd
Oh, really.|b
Um, yeah,|ny
it's, it's one of the reasons why, you know THE GODFATHER's been on our minds lately.|sd
Um, but, uh,|sd
And, uh, in his classes they're using, there's a bun-, they're running a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER|sd
and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing, you know, this Maf-, you know this, uh, organized crime head.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, it's um, it was, it was a fun movie.|sv
Uh.|%
or, uh, -|%
I liked RAINMAN,|sd
I thought, I thought it was interesting that he was doing som-, -|sd
Oh, yeah,|aa
that was good,|sv
I liked RAINMAN, too.|sd
Yeah,|b
well I'm, -|%
being from Baltimore, of course, I'm a big Barry Levinson fan since, uh, he, he's, you know, he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, n-, -|%
Barry Levinson did, um, DINER and TINMAN, and AVALON which are all set in Baltimore.|sd
Yeah,|b
they sound familiar.|sd
I probably saw parts of those.|sd
You know, a lot of times I'll wa-, I'll start watching a movie|sd
and I'm tired|%
and it, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
next thing you know, it's, it's -|%
especially if there's commercial in it -|sd
Ye-, -|%
we-, -|%
and then the titles might sound familiar|sd
but I really don't know what they're all about.|sd
Ye-, -|%
of the three of those, DINER's probably the best.|sv
I mean, they're, they're all pretty good,|sv
but DINER is really worth seeing.|sv
Is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties.|qy^d
Uh, late fifties,|na
yeah.|ny
Late fifties,|b^m
yeah,|b
I think I saw that one.|sd
Okay|b
and, uh, -|%
How about Meryl Streep,|qo
Uh, I don't know,|h
I'm not a real, uh, great football follower,|sd
I guess, there are two basic teams that I seem to follow every year.|sd
One is the Dallas Cowboys|sd
and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners.|sd
Oh, okay.|b
Uh, being a native Okie, I uh, I like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing. Uh.|sd
I see,|b
so you make it, uh, to that Longhorns Sooners game?|qy
No.|nn
Every year.|qy^d
No,|nn
it's funny.|sv
Uh, I got out and got my bachelor's degree in uh, seventy-three and, uh, never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since.|sd
How about that.|ba
But I always enjoyed watching them,|sd
I just -|%
growing up in Oklahoma, there it was always the home team, kind of like Dallas is around here.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
And there's always been an interest there.|sd
Well, it's kind of same for me,|sv
I grew up in southern New Jersey|sd
and the local team was Philadelphia.|sd
Yeah.|b
And they were like thirty miles right up the river|sd
and I'm still pretty much an Eagle fan, I guess.|sd
I guess you keep those things you grew up with.|sv
I worked in, uh, Missouri for a while|sd
and, uh, I was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on T V when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals|sd
and I was rooting for the Cowboys.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, they were kind of closer to home when, when I struck up with them.|sd
I really don't know what's going to take place with the Cowboys this year.|sd
Everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they're going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year.|sd
In a way that happened this past season,|sd
and I think that's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's a chance that maybe, uh, these guys are right, maybe they will come through and, and do something this year.|sd
I look for it to be a pretty good year.|sd
Boy they, uh, they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago.|sd
They did,|aa
uh, they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't, weren't familiar with.|sd
Some of them turned out to be pretty good players,|sd
uh, some of them didn't|sd
and you know maybe the stuff that, uh, Jerry Jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off.|sd
At least we hope it will.|sd
Yeah,|b
I'm, I keep waiting for the Eagles to get over the hump.|sd
They make it to the playoffs it seems for the last few years|sd
but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there|sd
And you know, they've got a lot of the tools to do it,|sd
but doggone if they can't just put it together, uh, you know, -|sd
they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham, who's just, you know, phenomenal,|sd
but, he, he's too streaky it seems.|sd
Yeah,|b
but they have always been a really strong team.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
and without a whole lot of big name players.|sd
They have got a few anchors on offense and defense|sd
and you know they, they've managed with those guys|sd
and I don't know.|h
Once the pressure gets turned on they, they seem to loose it.|sd
I guess, yeah.|b
See that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's funny, over the years.|sd
I guess since Staubach left, they haven't been able to,|sd
It's.|sd
I don't know why it's so hard to find, uh, a good quarterback these days.|sd
Well, that, that says a lot for the, for his ability, though I think.|sd
Well, yeah.|b
You know, he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform,|sd
uh, we hope, -|%
every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through.|sv
In a way Aikman has done some of that.|sd
But, uh, the guy winds up getting hurt every other game.|sd
Yeah,|b
I, I tell you, it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because there, he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things, you know.|sd
Yeah,|aa
they did.|sd
They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside.|sd
Uh, it's funny watching them, them play,|sd
he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks, uh,|sd
when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I haven't quite figured that out,|sd
if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, if, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing. They say, hey, we got to do something now. And then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, I don't know|h
I'm looking for a good year.|sd
I guess we're always looking for a good year.|sd
So, obviously though, do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the Super Bowl this year|bf
or who do you, who do you like to do that this year?|qrr
Uh, no|nn
I don't think the Cowboys have got a chance.|sd
I think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year,|sd
and they'll get close to it.|sd
They'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end.|sd
So who's going to beat them?|qw
Who are they going to blow it to?|qw
Uh, that's a good question.|sv
Uh, I'm figuring either one either the Eagles or possibly San Francisco|sd
I'm not real sure.|h
Boy, they'd some big changes, speaking of them.|sd
They did.|aa
So, I don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team, sometimes it brings in new motivation|sd
and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come.|sd
Yeah.|b
I'm sure, you know, my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia,|sd
but I, I sure am scared of them Giants|sd
Well, that's true.|ba
Those guys are tough.|sd
They are tough|bf
and they're big,|sd
they're mean|sd
and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something.|sd
Yeah.|b
That, that sure was a fun Super Bowl to watch this year.|sd
Oh, yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
I mean, I wasn't pulling for either team.|sd
No,|aa
no.|aa
But that was just a good football game.|sd
And it's funny,|sd
you know. You like to pull for the underdog|sd
and for a long time I was pulling for Denver.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes, because of some of the stupid stuff he does,|sd
but he's a good quarterback.|sd
He's got a good arm,|sd
sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard.|sd
L A you mean?|qy^d
I mean L A,|na
sorry.|fa
Boy, speaking of Denver, on another subject, I've been up there like five times in the last three, four weeks.|sd
Oh, yeah?|bh
Yeah|ny
we've been trying get this new D N B two thousand printer up and running.|sd
Has it been, uh, snowing up there?|qy
Oh, boy I was just up there,|^h
I just got back last night around eleven thirty or so,|^h
and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground.|na
Wow.|ba
And it snowed all day.|sd
Well, that will make the skiers happy.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
yeah.|b
If, if -|%
it snowed that much in Denver you know|sd
they got that much up in the mountains, you know, just west of there.|sd
Oh, you bet.|ba
Oh, yeah,|ba
up around the Keystone and Copper Mountain, those guys will love that.|sv
Well, good to talk to you.|fc
Yeah,|fc
enjoyed it Bob.|fc
You guys have a good time, keep those printers coming.|fc
Hey,|fc
we'll do it.|fc
All right,|fc
bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
Go ahead.|ad
Okay,|aa
do I still can-, still can feel that the Soviet Union, as such, is still a threat to the civilized western world?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Absolutely.|na
And my reasons are based upon not only from what I read in the newspapers, what I see on the newspapers, but up against some of the, fun and exciting things I ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group.|sd
Um. Okay.|b
I guess I don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be,|sv
but I think just the instability of the country right now is, sort of scary.|sv
Well, that's what makes it a powder keg.|sv
The, um, -|%
I'll go back in time a little bit, to about eighty-one,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, naturally we were at the time, -|sd
the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat.|sd
So we got lots, quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I went to Lebanon in eighty-three, before the marines ever got there, with the U N Peace Keeping Force. And with the training I received prior to going there, with captured weapons we kept running up against.|sd
These weren't, these weren't Chinese made copies.|sd
These were Soviet made, top of the line, fresh out of the box, A K forty-sevens.|sd
Um, uh-huh.|b
In Granada, in October, twenty-fifth, eighty-three, we invaded the place.|sd
Sure there were Cuban soldiers there,|sd
but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots.|sd
The team I was with, we jumped in on the western tip of, of the island down on Point Salinas.|sd
And for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors.|sd
Huh.|b
And they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons.|sd
In eighty-four, I was down in Central America, as an advisor to the Honduran Army.|sd
Again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit, plus Soviet advisors.|sd
And the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans, was brand new, out of the crate, Soviet made material.|sd
Do I consider them a threat?|qy
Absolutely.|na
They have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University.|sd
About like A and M or U T, where they're teachings subjects like that, they're teaching terrorism.|sd
Some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place.|sd
And let me tell you, they are nothing nice to go up against.|sd
Huh.|b
I'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did.|sd
These guys are top of the line.|sd
When they, when they graduate from there, they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world.|sd
And they are very, very good at what they do.|sd
So until I see the entire, quote, old guard of the Soviet military, of the Soviet government completely roll over and disappear, preferably buried, I still consider them a threat.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Their military is different from ours, to where there are extremist gen-, generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops.|sd
That -|%
irregardless of what Soviet policy is, they're going to do what the general tells them.|sv
Yeah.|b
I guess that's what concerns me the most. Is they're, they're so unstable that somebody like that could make, uh, decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people.|sv
Well, it's in-, interesting watching the different Soviet states, Albania, Lithuania, doing their little revolts down there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there.|sd
So far they haven't run into the real psychos yet.|sd
There's probably five or six, which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs, that are in positions over some of these Soviet states.|sd
If uprisings hap-, happen in their sectors, it is, it's going to be a total blood bath.|sv
Yeah,|b
it looks like it's come close to that as it is.|sv
Actually, they're showing remarkable restraint.|sv
They get real nasty, the hyundee helicopters come out|sd
and they, would level entire areas.|sd
Okay,|b
you're from the Dallas area, right?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Okay,|bk
you know, basically the size of, uh, the area around Richardson?|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
You put five Soviet hyundee helicopters in the air, they can level the entire area|sd
and there won't be anything left alive.|sd
And they can do that in about four minutes.|sd
Huh.|b
And they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by.|sd
They used them in Afghanistan, did re-, remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in.|sd
But on a highly populated area, like some of the Soviet cities would be, with the weaponry that's attached on those things, there is no place to hide.|sd
If the bombs don't get you, if the bullets don't get you, then, then the nerve gas definitely will get you.|sd
The only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time.|sd
They drink that much fuel.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Were you, -|%
have you, -|%
I take it you haven't spent any time in the military?|qy^d
No,|nn
I haven't.|sd
As a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military,|sd
I know a lot of this stuff that I was involved in, never did make the newspapers.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, during that same time frame, didn't you get some feeling, that, I mean, they're getting all these weapons and stuff?|qy
Didn't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff?|qy
You mean in the, in the most recent conflict?|qy
In any of them since eighty-one.|sd
Oh. Yeah,|ny
definitely.|na
I, I'm, I'm a little bit shocked to what the U S has done in terms of selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years.|sd
Yeah,|%
I think we, we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too.|sv
It's bad enough that the Soviets do it.|sv
It all boils down to, whether it's our side, their side,|sv
it's a matter of money,|sv
Um.|%
Uh-huh.|b
The deal the Iraqis have with the Russians was for oil.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons. Especially when it's to the south of us.|sv
Uh, the ones to the south are more regional conflict.|sd
They're not really that worried about invading north.|sd
They're more interested in, -|sd
they've got a screwed up situation, I'll give them that. From Mexico all the way down into Cen-, Central and South America.|sd
The situation down there is weird|sv
and it's very screwed up.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Inflation is out of this world|sd
and the governments, which our government has technically supported for years, are corrupt as all get out.|sd
And generally the people,|sd
and they're tired of it,|sd
and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it, even if that means going to communism.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, I think Russia is getting to the point where they're, they're about to do something to get out of communism.|sv
I guess I'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power.|sd
I think Gorbachev has about had his day.|sv
Unfortunately, Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard.|sv
That's the only drawback that I see with the entire thing.|sv
Yeah.|b
Gorbachev has made his attempt|sv
and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeltsin's in tight with the old guard.|sv
So it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
True|ba
I don't know,|h
I sure wouldn't turn my back on them.|sd
You mean, -|%
I understand when they pulled the troops out of, uh, or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down,|sd
I thought that was great.|sv
But by no means do I endorse or approve pulling everybody out.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there.|sd
But you still better have the key players in place, if something does go down. Even if it's a regional conflict.|sv
If United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is, not only does it, it can talk the talk, but it's got to be able to walk the walk.|sv
It's got to have the stuff to back it, back up what it's saying.|sv
If you've only got a token force there, you can't hold your ground.|sv
At least they're learning a little bit from history.|sv
I mean, uh, -|%
So, well, this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day,|sv
so. -|%
Right.|b
Um, well, what do you think is, uh, the pollutants, the main pollutants in the air?|qw
I have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that I just, uh, I think they put off so much|sd
and they're not regulated enough.|sv
Yeah,|b
well , that's me too.|sd
After, um, -|%
on channel thirteen, uh, they had some, some programs the day before,|sd
and I'm not sure that about yesterday, we didn't really watch it too much yesterday,|sd
but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and, you know, how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot,|sd
Yeah.|b
and that actually, um, as our population increases and, you know, our, of course, our, our cars, you know, our number of cars increase per the population, that's the problem. But also like you said the industry pollution|sd
and, you know, their reg-, their regulation that's placed on them is, I mean, it's better than it used to be|sd
but it's incredible that they still don't have, you know, they don't, they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air.|sd
Right.|b
You know, I, I just, -|%
I can't stand that|sd
and I know for a fact that they get away with a lot that, -|sd
you know, they're supposed to be regulated because we have a, we have a plant, I don't know about T I but we have a plant, uh, a Pillsbury plant,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I know people that work there that, -|sd
of course, you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals,|sd
No.|aa
but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the, um, what they do, uh, to, uh, make their dough and st-, to,|sd
Really?|bh
yeah,|b
Huh.|b
I mean, it's incredible.|sv
And, um, they said that they're, you know, they have a little creek that runs by them|sd
and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they, you know, shut down everything|sd
and they clean up their act, but on a normal basis that they're, that they're dumping things,|sd
Oh.|b
and I'm like, if they're getting away with it,|sd
Right.|b
that's a, that's a Pillsbury plant|sd
I can't imagine plants, -|sd
I wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury could, would, the, I mean, or even had chem-, you know, well, -|sd
those chemicals would not, -|%
Yeah,|b
they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff,|sd
Yeah.|b
and then they, they also do testing there,|sd
and I don't, -|%
you know, wh-, when you consider, you know, it's probably not radioactive|sv
but toxic can be, can be anything that's cr-, uh, classified that can damage the Earth.|sv
Right,|b
yeah.|b
So, there could be a lot of things that they could put, you know, that chemical wise that they use to, uh, that they are testing with,|sv
Right,|b
you know, like in,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, uh, you know, just goodness. -|%
Yeah,|b
I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,|sd
Yeah.|b
but they do, they do a lot of research|sd
and they do, um, they do, do a lot of the refining up there|sd
or, -|%
Yeah.|b
I'm not really, -|%
what's it called when you do flour, -|sd
I'm not, -|%
Uh, only thing I can think is bleaching|sd
but, I mean, I,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
But, um, we, we're on the southwest side of Houston|sd
we don't have that much as far as, uh, aiming in the plants over on this, uh, the we-, east side does.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We've got Imperial sugar|sd
but, uh, and they're, you know, they're right there on the creek also|sd
and, uh, they've been there for years.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, -|%
But,|%
I mean, you think about it, it, you know,|sd
it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just, -|sv
I'm not really sure|h
but I would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean-, or stream or such,|sv
Yeah.|b
or you can, you can, you know, do, uh, testing on the ground itself at that point,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but when they pollute into the air and you've got, you know, and you've got movement through the air, it's going to move a lot of that off.|sd
So, I don't see, you know, how they can do some of the te-, -|sd
unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution, you know, like in Los Angeles or, or the bigger cities where it, it tends to get stuck there, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
you know, that you have a lot more particles in the air,|sd
Right,|b
yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
but, um, -|%
I know that,|sd
I worry every now and then,|sd
we're still on a well water,|sd
we're not on city water,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I think, well, what if somebody's dumped something back there in the, and no one knows about it and, you know, it sinked in through the ground and all that,|sd
Yeah,|b
well, I know out in some, -|sd
I'm not sure,|h
I can't remember the name of the county|sd
it's, it's where Stillwater is or,|sd
Yeah.|b
no|ar
I'm not sure,|h
I know it,|^h
I think it's, uh, -|%
I know we have a piece property there,|sd
it's called Dublin,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
it's in Dublin, Texas.|sd
I'm not really sure what the county, -|sd
it's Stephen,|sd
no|ar
Stephenville.|sd
Oh, okay,|b
okay.|b
Okay,|b
where Stephenville's at,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
so, they have a lot of cattle in the area,|sd
I mean, they've got like per, per, ya-, uh, per lot, -|sd
you know, they've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't th-, th-, -|sd
it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free,|sd
Right,|b
uh-huh.|b
they've got to have them there to be able to milk them.|sd
And they, -|%
and I read in this article, I couldn't believe it, where, you know, like, one cow produces, like, a day, produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure.|sd
Oh.|b
One cow,|sd
I was like, my God,|sd
and they, -|%
and this thing says that, that, you know, it-, people think, well, cow manure is good for fertilizer|sd
but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not, it's not -|sd
when, you know, you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it|sd
and they've added humus and stuff that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, and this, and this article said that they've got a real problem that, um, you've got toxins and, and, uh, bacteria in the manure that is, -|sd
what it's doing is it's going through, uh,|sd
they don't have a very deep, um, o-, -|sd
you know, their water,|sd
Uh-huh. -|b
I forget what that's called with, you know, -|sd
it's like a spring, spring water,|sd
Yeah.|b
but it's below the surface|sd
it's not very far down,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and all this stuff is seeping through to the water,|sd
Oh.|b
and they're like, they're afraid that, you know, within a certain amount of years, that it's, their wa-, they're water in that town will be totally polluted,|sd
It will.|ba
and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have, um, polluted, completely polluted, so that they're, you know, there's too many toxins and bacterial growth,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|b
and the gr-, -|%
and I'm like my God, you know,|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
and the, the ground will filter some of it but not all of it.|sd
No,|aa
not when you figure, -|sd
I didn't realize a cow, one cow produces that much manure|sd
and they were talking like,|sd
These are well fed .|sd
These are, -|%
You, -|%
Good grief, these are well fed cows, uh,|ba
Well, they are evidently.|aa
But, um, I mean, ev-, evidently a normal cow produces that much too,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not, you know, a problem,|sd
Right.|b
but when they get them in these tiny little areas, you know, and they've got a real big problem,|sd
and they, they said that, that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff, and taking it to,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years, they just,|sd
Yeah.|b
and they overflow into the, the creeks and stuff in the area.|sd
So, that just creates, -|sd
you know, there, there's, -|%
and, oh, it was just disgusting|sv
it said the creeks will foam.|sd
Oh.|b
People, people stand outside their houses and their, watch the creeks foam brown and all,|sd
Oh, now that's bad.|ba
and I'm just like, oh, my gosh,|sd
and the smell is really bad they sa-, -|sd
Oh, I was going to say, the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad.|sd
Yeah,|b
but I, I don't know|h
it really frightens me though as far as the, when you think about the, you know, thinking of just air pollution itself|sd
and then, and, channel thirteen they're really, um, emphasizing the problem with acid rain, you know,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
if we, if we keep putting that stuff into the air and, and, you know, if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for, um, just the, the Earth, you know, what the Earth is receiving back, you know,|sv
Yeah.|b
Right,|b
right.|b
And then cutting the trees, you know, that bothers me.|sd
Yeah.|b
As far as, you know the -|%
The rain forest and all.|^2
yes,|aa
uh, we've been wanting to,|sd
well, not me -|h
but, uh, it's been recommend-, or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here,|sd
I'm like, no,|sd
you know, for what's cut down here, you know, more will be cut down someplace else|sd
and it will just take that longer to grow back,|sd
Yeah.|b
and trees help so that, uh, -|sd
I don't, -|h
Well, they do because, what is it, carbon dioxide,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they're synthesizing it for us.|sd
Right,|b
right,|b
believe me it's just so much better.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, uh, yeah,|b
I knew, -|%
I think there's lots that be, that could be done to, to improve how things are done now.|sv
Yeah,|b
I think we just have to, -|sv
I don't know personally, you know,|h
I suppose, you know, if you just make sure your car is,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and yo-, -|%
you know, they're suppos-, -|%
nowadays they have the emission controls on them|sd
but, uh, I think the only, the main thing is just keep on the, legis-, your legislator's back, you know, as far as, -|sd
seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
it, it's really becoming a problem.|sv
By the year two thousand there will, -|sd
what, what are we going to have, -|sd
what kind of results are we going to have for the environment.|sd
Right.|b
And, and what will we ... -|%
Huh?|br
Okay.|b
I don't know how much I know about this subject|h
Well, I don't know if I know anything or not,|h
Yeah.|b
but I've, I've got some opinions on it.|sd
Okay.|b
Go ahead.|ad
See those type of people that, that have the most opinions, ones that don't know anything|sv
Yeah|b
Well, uh, I've had teenagers|sd
and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers,|sd
and I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective.|sd
Uh, I think this "me" generation has gone far too far.|sv
And the young people are overly impressed.|sv
And I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a m-, far more disadvantaged viewpoint.|sv
That's true.|ba
Uh, I personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though.|sd
Um, me either.|sd
I, I went to college and then started working and then got married|sd
and, -|%
But they have, -|%
I read somewhere, -|sd
and I'm, I'm out on a limb here, some type of college, uh, volunteer work for teachers, that they are straight out of college|sd
and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the, uh, lower income brackets of the United States.|sd
Have you ever heard about that one?|qy
No,|nn
I haven't,|sd
I know that, uh, my sister, -|sd
I have a twin sister|sd
and when they graduated she went to, uh, teach in a small town down in south Texas|sd
and I know, that like if you have college notes, if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your, you know, your college note or whatever. -|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Uh-huh.|ny
If it's like, you know, really a, you know, a lower paying job, you know, where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to, you know, to live. -|sd
And this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education?|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
she only taught there one year|sd
but I, -|%
But she got credits for it?|qy^d
Uh-huh.|ny
That's very interesting.|ba
And, um, I think it would be, -|%
I know that also one of my cousins who, uh, he is in like the therapy type thing|sd
and he was, um, -|%
some group paid part of his college income|sd
but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at, uh, uh, -|sd
I mean, it's a nursing home or something like that.|sd
Huh.|b
So, you know, if, -|%
I think that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I think that is an excellent program,|sv
I really do.|sv
I like that.|sd
And it's, it's beneficial to the small towns too because,|sv
Yeah.|b
As far as ge-, yeah, getting doctors and all that stuff, yeah.|^2
Right,|aa
you know, if, if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist, we could find one it wouldn't be convenient,|sd
Yeah.|b
but we could find one.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, I, I can see the advantage to that one.|sd
The Peace Corps itself is really a, uh, dying out, isn't it?|qy
I really don't know that much about it,|sd
you know, I, I, I think of the Peace Corps, you know, more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when, -|sd
It's still in existence.|sd
Yeah.|b
And don't they go into other countries and stuff?|qy
I want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm,|na
Uh-huh.|b
Things that make the, -|%
yeah.|b
Make them more self-supporting?|qy^d
Yes.|ny
They, -|%
Yeah.|b
It's not a program to teach them to use the American money, it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant.|sv
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
And, yes,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
you're right,|sv
I think it's a sixties program.|sd
I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he, -|sd
that was his big deal.|sd
But it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it. -|sv
Right.|b
Right.|b
Um, I think I, I've singled out my grandchildren|sd
and but actually they're, they're pretty good,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good.|sd
Yeah.|b
But there's a, -|%
I don't, I don't know that you could require everyone to,|sd
Mandatory just like,|^2
No.|aa
I don't know that that would work if,|sd
Every time you, -|^2
They could buy their way out.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else|sv
Right,|b
you know, they, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat.|sv
But, I'm wondering if there's another issue here,|sd
and maybe this is why this has died out.|sv
Can you go into, -|%
and this wasn't the question|sd
but it's, it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults, -|sv
can they go in there and can anyone go into, well, out of -|qy
the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time,|sd
but say, I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some, some really desperate situation|sv
and teach them to farm and teach them -|qy
and it doesn't do any good.|sv
Yeah.|b
I don't know that it does.|sd
I, I,|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, we're losing certain,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
There are people now that are obsolete point and fact just, just like endangered species of animals, so there are quote tribes of people,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And I'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out.|sv
There's a German word for it that's elegant,|sd
but I never can remember what it was,|sd
uh, but, but that they're, they're being winnowed because they're, where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially.|sd
Right,|b
yeah.|b
Um, and one of the quick examples is the Aborigines.|sd
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
Uh, when we were in Australia, uh, -|sd
sad little things. Uh, I felt sorry for them. Because their society isn't there anymore,|sd
and their belief system and a-, all their structured of theirs, all the structures of their society are gone, essentially.|sd
Yeah.|b
And they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else|sd
and that's sad.|sv
Yeah.|b
But I don't think there's any way you could go, uh, the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people,|sv
and I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, I, I'm wondering if the Peace Corps is,|sv
Well, -|%
Down here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that I think probably need help and,|sd
Good point.|ba
We've got enough without lea-, without a passport|sv
there's plenty.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yes.|b
I think we ought to worry about our own species.|sv
And maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the United States.|sv
I wonder now in, -|%
and I've been out of school too long to answer this,|sd
but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.|sd
There probably are, you know,|sv
for -|%
but I'm sure, -|sv
that's probably like people that do that are, are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff|sv
but I think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something, you know, and realize it's everybody's responsibility to, um, help these people, you know,|sv
and no-, -|%
I'm not saying just give them money -|sd
but, I mean, because they have to be taught to be, -|sd
That's the last thing you want,|sv
Yeah|b
I mean, I know that's what my father-in-law was talking about, you know, when you give these people money|sv
or, what was it|^h
they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give, um, more money to these people,|sd
I mean, and that's not really the answer, I mean , because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend,|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's exactly it.|sv
but. -|%
They're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it.|sv
Now come on, let's be realistic,|ad
Yeah.|b
that's just not realistic.|sv
Or, you know, to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves,|^2
Right.|aa
I mean, I guess we're getting kind of off the subject, here,|sv
but. -|%
No,|ar
we're not I don't think.|sv
I think,|sv
Yeah,|b
I mean it's, -|%
True.|ba
Yeah.|b
I think that's a lot more realistic.|sv
Uh, I, I think that we should be spending more time|sv
and, and again I don't think the, the Peace Corps is, is as successful now simply because it's not. It doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh, we've got plenty,|sv
in fact, we've got far too many.|sv
You're in, uh, what r-, Flower Mound?|qy
Flower Mound,|na
yeah.|ny
So, we're a little fa-, you know, farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing.|sd
I was, -|%
that's exactly what I was going to ask you.|sd
Have you ever, have, have you been downtown recent-, -|qy
Start.|ad
What kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett?|qw
Um, th-, -|%
well right now they've got a, kind of a central location off of the main highway,|sd
and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper, um, plastic, um, I think three bins for glass, white, green, and whatev-, whatever other combination there is.|sd
And, and I think they've got a comp-, uh, some kind of container for aluminum.|sd
Plano's doing real good on that.|sd
They have, uh, they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and of course it doesn't fit right now.|sd
Yeah.|b
But now we start in May, breaking it down,|sd
and they're picking it all up.|sd
Um.|%
So they're going to by, -|sd
and we have to separate our papers, and our glass,|sd
and then, uh, they have one day for, like, um, oh, everything you picked up from your yard,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we put that in disposable bags,|sd
and they pick that up on Monday.|sd
Um.|b
So it's really great.|sd
I, I'm really going head, you know, completely for it,|sd
I think it's marvelous.|sd
Well, that's good.|ba
Well, Rowlett had sent, sent out a survey, not too long ago, um, in terms in how many people were interested in having a, a pick up, I guess, on the days they do trash or something like that.|sd
And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorl-, favorably, because they're going to do it.|sd
I don't know how, how soon they're going to do it, or how organized it's going to be,|sd
but they're, they're supposed to initiate that some-, sometime in the next couple of months.|sd
Well, does your, uh, -|qy
where you work, do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that?|qy
Um, I've never noticed that.|no
We don't have a, a whole lot, because we're in a hospital setting,|sd
so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria. Um,|sd
Well, down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your, you know, pop cans, and things like that?|qy
Um, no.|nn
There's, there's only one pop machine|sd
and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now,|sd
so, uh, mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea.|sd
So you don't have much choice there.|bf
No|aa
Not, not really.|sd
Well I work at, uh, J C Penny|sd
and last week they brought, -|sd
they have a sign up that says for one full week --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they're going to recycle them.|sd
Um.|%
So it's getting people clean out their closets and such.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then like, the week before that, they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good, bring it in|sd
and they brought it down to the shelters.|sd
And, they have, one, two, they have three, I think, that I know of --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they put them right near where they have the time cards.|sd
Yeah.|b
And it works great.|sd
And they have one in the room where the snack machines are too.|sd
That's good.|ba
So they're really going at it,|sd
and I think it's marvelous because, -|sd
Yeah.|b
I, I guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is.|sd
Well, -|%
And I think they're trying to, to make some changes.|sd
I, I noticed at the library or someplace this past, uh, month, month and a half ago, they were having a speaker, um, talk about doing lawn work and, h-, how important it is to, to cut your lawn without a bag. Just to kind of mulch it,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it's, uh, I guess a lot more e-, ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil.|sd
Well, did you watch the program the other night on, um, was it SAVE AMERICA?|qy
I saw part of that.|na
It was good.|sv
The only thing I g-, thought, um, that I haven't been trying, is when I, you know, go to take a shower, to save the water,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But I've already gone to, -|sd
oh I started years ago, I guess, not years ago, -|sd
but, yeah|%
I would say five years ago, turning off my fountain, I mean my water faucet,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water.|sd
Yeah.|b
That was surprising to me.|sd
Um.|%
I missed that question, totally, I mean really bad.|sd
I'm trying to think,|sd
I didn't miss too many,|sd
I can't remember what my score was,|sd
but I did exceeding well.|sd
I was surprised.|sd
But I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed.|sd
That was a shocker to me.|sd
Yeah,|b
well there are a lot of things that aren't,|sd
I'm , -|%
that's, uh, one of the things I wonder about,|sd
uh, one of the questions was, do you think more should be done, or something else.|sd
I, I wonder about some of the prod-, products that they don't take, like some of the plastics and things that they don't take. Uh, why, why they couldn't do more recycling with those.|sd
Well, I was in, uh, Bizmart the other day,|sd
and, what I don't understand is there is recycled paper in there,|sd
and it cost more than regular paper.|sd
Um.|%
And it was only, I think, uh, forty cents more, you know, fifty cents more,|sd
but,|sd
Yeah.|b
but people aren't buying it,|sd
so the cost of it is higher.|sd
True.|ba
Yeah,|b
I noticed that about things like -|sd
I s-, I seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and, and lawn additives and that type of thing,|sd
but the cost is, is like, double or sometimes triple,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, in, in terms of that, -|%
it's, -|%
you know, and, for the environment it's, it's, there's a good reason to do it,|sv
but the cost is kind of prohibitive.|sv
Now, see that's recycling, you know,|sd
companies that do at least go into it,|sd
I'd like to see subsidy by the government or something, or tax-wise or something, heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So that people would use this stuff re-, over again.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's a good idea.|ba
It's like when he was saying, uh, which one was recyclable, which was reusable,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and the recycle ones are better to use,|sd
but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles.|sd
Yeah,|b
true.|ba
And if we're going to really do something, they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it.|sv
I had to put my bifocals on to see it|sd
Um.|%
That's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway.|sv
Yeah.|b
You have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf.|sv
You haven't got enough nerve to say well, put it back,|sv
it's not recyclable.|^q
I, I'd heard something stranger,|sd
talk about bottles the other day on, uh, on the radio station, I think it's K L T Y. They were talking about the, -|sd
I think it's in Canada they're using, oh, recyclable milk jugs, plastic milk jugs,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, really?|bh
And apparently they, they don't break down very easily,|sd
and,|sd
Oh.|b
and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing.|sd
You know they're, -|%
along that same line, they said they were using, um, -|sd
what is, oh, I know, -|^h
it was toilets. You know, the old ones?|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Huh.|b
And I thought, well, that's good.|sd
And then I saw recycling on tires between, uh, -|sd
well, hoses were being used,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
What else, -|%
something else was made out of old tires,|^h
I was trying to remember what it was. Oh, I can't think of it now.|^h
But I was, I was trying to get my, uh, kids, you know, to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And just anything, to, you know, recycle rather than keep throwing it away,|sd
but my biggest problem is, I take the bags out of the store, buy the bags to bring the back,|sd
and then I forget to bring them in the store.|sd
Yeah.|b
I'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out.|sd
I wish they'd really push this recycling bit, because I never realized, I really didn't realize how much stuff I actually throw away.|sd
Well, I think the, the more people are aware of it, the, the more they'll do.|sv
I think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in, in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is, and how important it is to do that.|sv
You know what I'd like to see a little more. -|sd
I don't have any little tiny kids,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now,|sv
Yeah.|b
True.|ba
Because it's, -|%
we've all got to do it right now.|sv
I just, -|%
I really amazed to find out that, what is it, eighty per cent are filled now, in, in garbage fills.|sd
In five years we're supposed to be at max.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't think I can keep my own garbage.|sd
I mean, I might not have that much,|sd
but I wouldn't, -|sd
I have, uh, -|%
I, well, I used to have the opinion that there wa-, that there really was not any more crime in America, in the cities, anyway, than there was in previous centuries, uh, before, uh, -|sd
simply because. -|%
The reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced, uh, reporting methods, with computers and other devices.|sv
Compile more statistics.|bf
That's right,|aa
and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
However, I have been persuaded, lately, I guess, simply by the, uh, overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime.|sv
More especially where you are.|aa
Are you,|qy
Well, yeah.|b
No,|nn
I am in, I am in Washington D C.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
I was going to say, -|%
Actually it, -|%
you know, I do a lot of business here,|sd
and I come here quite often|sd
and, and that again is a, is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
but it's, it's real, uh, -|%
there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they, uh, -|sd
It just really grabs your attention.|ba
Yeah.|aa
It just makes the whole place seem like that.|sv
Right.|b
Now just to focus on that a minute, I guess, uh, uh, -|sd
when, uh, previous secretary of, uh, educa-, Bennett, I think his name was,|sd
Yeah.|b
and I see that even he was met without, with, with little success, even though the entire, I guess a, a quite a bit of money and other, uh, planning efforts went into that.|sd
What do you, what do you think is causing all this,|qo
Well, -|%
because, it seems that there -|%
even though -|%
crime, though I think it is increasing in number, it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity,|sv
Yes.|aa
Well, I, I have three theories about it, you know, three things.|sd
I have one theory,|sd
and it's brought to us by two things.|sd
One I, I believe that this is a function of, uh, the violence that young people see on television and the movies.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, I am not just talking about, you know, uh, role models of gu-, of tough guys and gangsters and things like that,|sd
I am not even, I am not even convinced that maybe things like football, hockey and, th-, th-, the, you know, the, and even baseball games now where the, everything is settled with a fight. You know, the, the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle th-,|sv
And, and then I, I am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree,|sd
so I think that particularly -|%
I, I was reading the other day about, uh, Corpus Christi, Texas which has the the highest, -|sd
I think it's Corpus Christi, that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America --|sd
Yeah,|b
I was, I have not seen that,|sd
but, uh, -|%
I mean the Saturday night special stuff|sd
so, -|%
Yeah.|b
That, that's what I think about it,|sd
that's some of the things I think about it,|sd
plus like drop I do not know,|sd
what are your views?|qo
Well, yeah,|b
I tend to agree with you with, you know, -|aa
it seems anymore, uh, a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some, some sort of violence,|sv
Yes.|aa
And, and along with that, you know, -|%
and then you start making a movie and it has no, there's no call for something violent,|sv
but, so they just throw something in there just to say they have it|sv
Exac-, -|aa
well that's, that's, that's the impression I get, you know.|aa
Yeah.|b
And I, and I imagine that it's, you know, it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society,|sv
people want to, -|%
it conditions people to it|sv
and, uh, you have to amp-, -|%
it has to be even, uh, magnified to to attract people's attention. I guess,|sv
Yeah,|aa
you become callous.|bf
Yeah.|b
And I am sure that it does form role models for young, for young men and young women|sv
and, -|%
Yeah.|b
uh, I mean I, I, read now where we are, you know, -|sd
women are arr-, young women are arrested fighting with knives over, over whatever.|sd
Um.|b
Now, I do not want to sound like an old fart,|arp_nd
but,|%
seems that those things happened befor-, did not happen in that manner before television.|sv
And I, I, I, I have to think that, that it has some influence on it.|sv
But, -|%
I listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time --|sd
Yeah.|b
I do not know if you listen to him or not,|qy^d
No.|nn
he's on A M,|sd
but, ther-, there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the, -|sd
there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for Los Angeles, the guy under Gates,|sd
Oh, yes.|ny
and they were just really coming down on him because of some of the things he was, just some of the things that he believed in, some of his morals.|sd
For instance, uh, they asked him if he spanked his kids,|sd
and he said "You bet, I believe in discipline".|sd
And people, I, I, I, I guess they confus-, confused discipline with punishment.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know. -|%
Yeah.|b
And, just, -|%
it seems anymore that, uh, if, if you have, you know, this type of a moral stance, that people come down on you.|sv
It's like, you know, hey, everybody has to be free to do their own thing.|sv
And I disagree,|ar
and I think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime.|sv
Yes,|aa
yes.|aa
Well, I mean, I, I guess what I wanted to say and I stopped, uh, I do not know, I got diverted, was that, that, uh, there's so mu-, there's so much of a return from pris-, to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure.|sv
And, and that is not emphasized.|sv
I recognize there's, there's over crowding problems|sd
and, and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now, that that's complicated the entire process.|sv
Yeah.|b
What I also think that, -|%
I guess it's the reflection of the society where, where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to, uh, -|sv
you know, it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you, where you live|sv
or. I do not mean respons-, attachment and responsibility,|sd
I guess I mean any sort of, -|%
Well, nobody feels responsibility to do something.|sv
It's like, oh boy, I wish they would stop doing that.|sv
Yes,|aa
that's right.|aa
Yeah.|b
Yeah|b
I, I do not know how that's, -|h
I do not think it's done by, uh, -|h
the changes come simply by statutory nature.|sv
I do not know what it really will take|sd
Um.|b
And, I do not know if I have solutions, except, except to, -|sd
you know, I am sort of a, a, an advocate of, of, uh, of letting people, of having free speech|sd
and I guess to curb, uh, -|%
television, uh, the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that.|sv
Yeah.|b
However, there does seem to be a, -|%
right now in verbalizing, -|%
it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort.|sv
Yeah,|b
and then how many, -|%
And the sacrifice is not that great.|sv
How many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between,|qh
Yeah.|b
I mean, what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do.|sv
Yes,|aa
yes,|aa
I think, I think that's correct.|aa
And, yes|%
but, you know, as soon as you start, uh, -|%
Well, Texas has, uh, Texas has, uh, has always struck me, -|sd
I mean I, I, I have lived in and out of Texas, both in the service and, uh, uh, short business stints.|sd
And it seems to me they are a pretty, pretty tough law and order state,|sv
but that's a, -|%
but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state.|sv
Just citing that, you know. -|%
Yeah,|b
uh, unfortunately you have got a lot of the, uh, -|%
some, well a lot of it can be contributed to th-, the racial differences, I mean, just that we are so close,|sv
Yeah.|b
we have got a lot of that influence.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yes,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I talked with, um, I talked with people from Richardson and Plano|sd
and, uh, the first three days, -|%
and then yesterday I talked with someone with, from Pennsylvania,|sd
so, -|%
Yeah,|b
because, -|%
it's the, -|%
I've only made, -|%
this is only my third call.|sd
Oh.|b
I, I tried to make calls two different days|sd
and I couldn't get through.|sd
Oh, I know.|aa
Sometimes I just -|%
I'm, in, -|%
it just takes a very long time|sd
so, -|%
Does it?|bh
Yeah,|b
I've been trying to, you know, do that,|sd
and, and sometimes I just can't wait that long,|sd
Yeah,|aa
I know.|aa
so I just hang up.|sd
Well.|arp_nd
This is hilarious|sv
But I knew as soon as I heard your voice,|sd
I thought, Kathy's, it's Kathy Kester|sd
Oh. Well, tell me, what books have you read lately?|qw
Well, let's see,|^h
I, um, gosh, I can't even think.|sd
I haven't read any,|sd
and you're such a reader, I know that|sd
and I, -|%
Well, I don't read all that much for enjoyment.|sd
I mean, I read a lot for school,|sd
but gee, I just don't have much time for enjoyment reading|sd
Yeah.|b
The, the last book I picked up was a book by Judy Bloom,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it was, um, it was called, um, SMART WOMEN, I think.|sd
Um.|b
Yeah.|b
And it was, it was kind of, -|%
I really didn't like it at all.|sd
Huh.|b
It was, it was written back in the early eighties.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
And it was all this, this, um, divorced woman syndrome --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
it was almost like a, a pre-AIDS scare kind of thing.|sd
Interesting.|ba
It was really an interesting, -|aa
because I, I right away looked at when it was copyrighted.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yes,|aa
yes,|aa
yeah.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
That kind of was, um, kind of a pop psychology time for wh-, when a lot of books like that were coming out, I think.|sv
That's right.|aa
And so that makes real sense, that that's, um, when it was written.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Um, I haven't, wasn't really aware that she had written anything for, um, adults.|sd
I was always,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
for her young people, her books. - *one utt?|sd
Yeah,|b
and she's more famous for that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but she has been writing for adults also,|sd
I'll be darned.|ba
and so I thought hey, I'll just try this, you know,|sd
Yeah.|b
It was very, um, -|%
the style was very conversational.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You would have lots of conversations between people --|sd
Yeah.|b
Right,|b
yeah,|b
yeah.|b
You know how that is,|qh
and um, -|%
Yeah.|b
I wonder if she's written anything really recently, if she's got anything printed, in print.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
she has,|sd
because I, I remember seeing a new book by her --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I think it was a, it was an adult book.|sd
I'll be darned.|ba
So anyway, -|%
Yeah.|b
but that's the last thing I, I've read,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, um, -|%
Well, it's, -|%
I'm trying to think the last actual book I read that wasn't, -|sd
let's see, I think I read, oh, -|^h
when I was on vacation, um, between semester break and summer, you know, on semester break between spring and summer -- -|^h
Yeah.|b
-- and I went to my mother's,|^h
I read a book that I have, should have read when I was probably in high school.|sd
I read, um, JANE EYRE.|sd
I, -|%
No,|ar
wait a minute,|^h
wait a minute,|^h
wait a minute.|^h
JANE EYRE?|qy
No,|nn
no,|nn
no,|nn
no,|nn
it wasn't JANE EYRE.|sd
WUTHERING HEIGHTS?|qy
No,|nn
it was, um, uh, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE,|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
by Jane Austen,|b^m
yes.|b
That's what it was,|sd
yes.|aa
Yes.|aa
And, um, you know, I, I didn't know what to expect, except I had heard that, that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist,|sd
and she really was good.|sv
I mean, I was, was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so,|sd
Uh-huh.|%
and, um, and, you know, I just, -|%
but I, as I say, I was pretty much ashamed that I hadn't read something before then.|sd
Yeah.|b
Because I, I think I was, I think I read it in college,|sd
but I don't remember it.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
And then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think it was, um, oh, some actress reading it.|sd
Oh, how interesting.|ba
You know, they had an abridged version of it on tape.|sd
Yeah.|b
And so I got that for her,|sd
and she loved doing that.|sd
Oh, I'll bet,|ba
yeah.|b
But I remember that was the book.|sd
Yeah.|b
And now I, I mean, I think it's around here somewhere,|sd
Right|b
I wouldn't be,|ba
I'm just going to have to put it,|sd
yeah.|b
Sure.|ba
Oh, yeah.|b
But, um, -|%
Well, I read that,|sd
and then I'm trying to think, um, -|^h
usually I try to, to find something long that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
when -|%
if, if I have long periods of time, like Christmas vacation, or, you know, when I know I'm not going to be doing anything for a while, um,|sd
Yeah.|aa
Oh, that's what I do too.|sd
Yeah,|b
and that's about it, because otherwise I'm reading so much for school.|sd
I'm, um, I have just started reading a book.|sd
Actually, it's for school,|sd
but it's for, um, -|%
there's a, a literary jour-, -|%
well, not a literary journal, -|%
it's a, it's kind of a journal of, of the history of ideas that's, that's starting to be published, um, from U T D.|sd
The first issue doesn't come out until next year,|sd
but, um, -|%
Oh, yeah.|b
I'm doing some reviews of books, just to, what, to sort of recommend to wh-, whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal,|sd
Oh, how neat.|ba
and I've, -|%
yeah,|aa
it's really neat because these are brand new books|sd
and I,|sd
Oh, great.|ba
um, most of the stuff is on, uh, literary criticism and philosophy,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
This one is on Johann Sebastian Bach,|sd
and it's a, a, a biography,|sd
Oh, great.|ba
Oh, that's fascinating.|ba
I mean, it, it's fascinating,|aa
it really is.|aa
Oh.|b
Um, but it's so long,|sd
I, I don't really have the time to read the whole thing,|sd
but I think,|sd
Yeah.|b
But it's,|%
Yeah.|b
I mean the, the copyright is nineteen ninety-one,|sd
so it's a brand new book.|sd
Oh, it's a brand new book.|bf
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
Oh, that, that would be wonderful --|ba
Yeah,|b
and he really, this man really shed some light on, um, some,|sd
Yeah.|b
I mean, you know, that was --|sv
Yes.|b
Yeah,|aa
and they just went from generation,|sv
Yeah.|aa
that's right.|aa
Yes,|aa
uh-huh,|b
and, um, -|%
Yeah,|aa
that's the way it was, I'm sure back then.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, uh, -|%
Yeah.|b
Oh, that's interesting.|ba
it was just really interesting,|aa
if that's, you know, that's kind of what, -|%
but I have to -|%
not only am, am I re-, reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed, but also, um, because the board of advisers for this, um, journal doesn't have, right now doesn't have a really respected name, um, who's a, uh, a scholar on, on music,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
um, and I'm supposed to decide whether I think this man might be a worthy person to be a, you know, in that position on the board|sd
so, -|%
Oh, yeah.|b
I don't know if I want to take that responsibility or not,|sd
but|sd
Wow, that's rough.|ba
That's real rough.|ba
so, um,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
it is.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
I think that's probably a, sort of a thing to do --|sv
Yes|b
Yeah,|b
but, um, -|%
that it, -|%
you know, you see, you see a lot of small colleges doing things,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
right,|b
uh-huh,|b
Yeah.|b
because it attracts really a, a lot people's interest.|sv
That's one way, -|%
it's really good public relations for small schools,|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
I think so|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, another one of my projects this summer is, actually it's part of my research assistantship, is, um, it's helping a professor, uh, compile a bunch of translations of, of various poems for a book that he's writing,|sd
and --|sd
Oh.|b
Now, translations, what do you mean, translations of, of, -|qw
Um, well, where, where, for instance, um, a Baudelaire poem that was written,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, I see.|bk
And the translations are all so different from one another.|sd
All different.|b^m
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, that's interesting.|ba
So it's multiple translations of single works|sd
and, and that's right now, right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as, um, -|sd
my work, is just kind of compiling,|sd
Gosh.|ba
So, -|%
That's great.|ba
It's real interesting.|aa
Boy, you really lift me up to a different, -|ba
I mean, here I, I'm dealing with, uh,|sd
and, -|%
You know, I'm|sd
That would be nice.|ba
I don't know if I've told you,|h
but, um, this is not on the subject, -|sd
Jeri?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yes.|ny
We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done with it.|sd
That's a rather, rather broad topic|sv
They're usually pretty broad anyway.|sv
Yeah.|b
Where do you live?|qw
Uh, we live in Plano.|sd
Okay,|bk
so, that's a, -|%
Uh, and where you are?|qw
I'm in Richardson,|sd
so --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Right,|b
that is so frightening.|ba
It is, you know,|aa
Uh, do you have children in school?|qy
No,|nn
mine are already in college now,|sd
so --|%
Yeah.|b
at least when they were in high school, it was beginning but not like the rampages.|sd
Well, I have, -|%
my oldest is his first year in high school|sd
so we have all this to, to look forward to,|sd
and it is really frightening, uh, to think that you can't even send them to school in safety.|sv
I mean, certainly, you know, you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas,|sv
but, you know, when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in safety, it, it's really frightening.|sv
That's true.|aa
And, uh, I really, you know, -|%
they're coming down on the principal,|sd
but I really don't know what they can do.|sd
I mean, it's just in so much of society with the violence|sv
and the kids having access to weapons and drugs|sv
and I, I really don't know what, what can be done.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, I just, I just don't understand how, of course, in my little world, how guns could be so available.|sd
Well I don't either,|sd
but apparently they just really are.|sv
Uh I mean, to me, in Plano you would think that would be about, you know, about as innocent as you could get for for being in a, a large area.|sv
But, you know, my son comes home and tells me that, you know, he hears kids talk about having guns|sd
and uh, someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun.|sd
Oh, my heavens.|ba
And, I mean, it just scared me to death|sd
and, you know, they called the police|sd
and, and nothing happened,|sd
but my goodness you know, it, it could have easily.|sv
Well, maybe that's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution.|sv
Maybe so.|aa
You know, because I don't, -|%
now I, somehow I feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, you know, across the street, or seeing someone get mugged, or unfortunately, raped,|sv
and people don't do anything.|sv
Yeah.|b
A woman was raped in Richardson, I read in the paper oh, about a two weeks ago now.|sd
And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help.|sd
Oh, no.|ba
But nobody, nobody did anything.|sd
I just can't imagine that.|sd
You know, I mean they heard someone calling for help.|sd
Nobody even called the police to say, you know, I hear a strange screaming --|sd
Right.|b
-- I'm afraid, you know, if you, -|%
I don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves.|sd
Right,|aa
well, I can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a house or something, not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be dangerous,|sv
but certainly I can't understand not calling the police.|sd
Yeah.|b
I, -|%
I just, you know, -|%
it's, it's really frightening that we're not, we're trying to live in our own little cocoons|sv
and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention.|sv
Right.|aa
Well I, I think you're right there.|aa
I guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business,|sv
but I think that's real dangerous|sv
and, uh, I don't know.|h
I try to tell my kids just, just kind of be aware of what's around them, you know|sd
and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble, just get out of it or call for help, whichever.|sd
Yes.|b
But, uh, -|%
Yeah,|b
well, you know, the call for help is what scares me now because it, it just, -|sd
I don't know,|h
people just don't, -|%
I don't know,|h
I can't say they don't care, because people just have to care about another person.|sv
Yeah.|b
But it's that not getting involved, that impersonal society, I think we live in today.|sv
Well, maybe this thing with with the child at school, maybe that will make people think a bit more and, you know, take some steps to, to correct it.|sv
I don't know,|h
it's, it really is, is frightening.|sv
Yeah|b
I, uh, -|%
Let me ask you,|oo_co_cc
getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing, -|sd
he didn't have a license for the gun, correct?|qy
I don't know.|no
I mean, I don't know the details.|sd
This was not a child that was on the team.|sd
It was someone that, uh, show-, you know, just kind of showed up at the field.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, it was a, a student age person,|sd
but I'm not even, -|%
Tell me what you like to do.|ad
Well, I, I collect antique tools, uh, for one thing, I well, I'm sort of in an antique business,|sd
but it's a little --|sd
Oh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
wonderful.|ba
And, uh, I'm building a, a log house at a farm that I have in East Texas, which is --|sd
Oh.|b
Wonderful.|ba
Yeah,|b
it's really neat.|ba
And, uh, uh, course I've been working on it for five years,|sd
but, you know, -|%
Oh, but how wonderful.|ba
Are you close to getting it done?|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
it's getting real close to -- -|sd
Oh.|b
-- you know, of course there's still a lot of work to be done,|sd
and then when you get it completely, you know, the shell finished, uh, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside,|sd
but, uh, -|%
Are you going to move your whole family over there then?|qy
No,|nn
actually, uh, I'm not even sure,|sd
I may,|aap_am
I'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas|sd
Uh-huh,|b
kind of your getaway place.|sv
Yeah,|aa
escape.|sd
But it's beautiful,|sd
it's, you know, it's Eastern Hardwood, uh, forest,|sd
there are a lot of pine trees,|sd
but it's mostly oaks|sd
and . -|%
Oh, how beautiful,|ba
and it's pretty flat there?|qy
Well, it's kind of, hilly,|ng
but, it's, you know, low hills,|sd
it's not, uh, -|%
See, I've only been to Texas once.|sd
I have two sisters in Texas now, um, one in Austin, one in Dallas,|sd
and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and, uh, I thought Austin was beautiful --|sd
You, -|%
-- I liked the hills --|sd
Yeah,|b
in Aus-, -|%
Yeah,|b
it's really different because that's kind of the, you know, that's the chalk hills down there,|sv
Oh, and you've always,|qy
Yeah,|ny
except for time in service.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Born and raised Texan, huh.|bf
Yeah.|aa
Well, I had never been there,|sd
that's pretty neat.|ba
My sisters both seem to like it pretty well.|sd
My brother-in-law works for the University, um, in Dallas.|sd
Wh-,|qw
He's admissions director.|sd
Uh. University of Texas in Dallas.|sd
Oh, okay --|bk
Yeah.|b
-- it's just north of me here.|sd
Yeah,|b
well that's, he's got a job there|sd
and this is his first year,|sd
so, it's been a real interesting thing for them|sd
That's great.|ba
But they seem to like it okay.|sd
I think they're too far away from me,|sv
but --|sv
Well, yeah,|b
we'll see.|sd
Pretty good trip.|sv
So what do you, what kind of hobbies are you in?|qw
Well, I'm mother of four,|sd
so basically I'm just,|sd
and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight,|sd
and, I substitute at the schools part-time.|sd
Oh, that's great.|ba
Well, I am a travel agent at heart,|sd
and my hobby is just, -|%
I love traveling and, and being involved of that and finding out more, uh,|sd
but, it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband,|sv
so --|sd
No, kidding.|aa
so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting,|sd
and I'm enjoying it.|sd
I'm around my kids|sd
That's pretty easy substituting isn't it?|qy
yeah,|ny
it's great,|ba
it's great,|ba
and what else do I do,|t1
I do lots of cross stitching when I have time --|sd
Ooh.|b
-- and I enter things in our little state fair,|sd
and that's pretty fun.|ba
That's great.|ba
Well, but, actually my hobbies is mostly is my sports. Tennis,|sd
I play tennis.|sd
Ooh, I love tennis too --|sd
Ooh,|b
do you?|bh
-- and I ski, ski,|sd
do you ski?|bh
Yes,|ny
we snow ski.|sd
We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly --|sd
Uh, that's great.|ba
have you ever been there?|qy
No, uh,|nn
Wonderful place.|ba
I've skied in Colorado|sd
and --|sd
Ooh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Where in Colorado?|qw
I've been to Telluride which is on the west side --|sd
Yes,|b
yes.|b
Copper is kind of my favorite up there.|sd
Really.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I guess those are the only places I've skied up there.|sd
I would love, -|%
I can hardly wait to get --|sd
Me, too.|sd
You guys, are you guys getting snow?|qy
We, -|%
it is snowing right now.|na
We're to get one to three inches tonight.|sd
Oh, gee,|ba
I heard Aspen got three feet.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
well we're, we are on the dry side of the mountains.|sd
Seattle is only about two and a half hours,|sd
so of course I'm a real Seahawks fan --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and, um, going over that pass is just a real nightmare.|sv
I can imagine, my lord.|ba
And, um, so, and we're on the colder side,|sd
they're on the rainy side,|sd
we're on the snowy side|sd
and, um, we, we ski.|sd
My, my children all ski --|sd
Oh, super.|ba
-- and we've, we have been to Whistler in Canada, which is just a marvelous place,|sd
Whistler and Black Home is in Canada,|sd
and then we've gone to Sun Valley several times,|sd
that's a, just a great place. But no Colora-, not in Colorado|sd
since I was in college, since I went to school, -|sd
What about Utah?|qo
Haven't been there,|sd
I keep hearing these marvelous things --|sd
Yeah,|b
haven't either.|sd
um, to don't, Adam, talking to um --|t3
Always want to go to Canada --|sd
Ooh, yes.|b
And your kids all ski?|qy
Uh, not all of them|ng
Uh-huh.|b
My, my kids are all grown.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But my youngest son is a skier.|sd
Really,|b
that's great.|ba
Well, my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
When they're skiing they're fearless,|sd
and they go off, -|sd
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
When they first said the subject, my mind went kind of blank.|sd
I thought, Gee, I haven't taken anything back for a long time.|sd
Well, I haven't either, uh,|sd
I, I hate returning things.|sd
Yeah.|b
I mean, I, I have a friend who, if she likes something, isn't sure what size somebody might need, will buy it in every color and size and, you know, take everything back again|sd
Yeah.|b
It's, you know, it's a game to her,|sd
but I, I do not like to do that|sd
I consider it kind of a, a waste of my time.|sd
And so I'm usually, uh, pretty careful when I shop --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I also, you know, usually have, have checked over things, you know, if it's like an appliance or something to make sure, uh, it has the features in it that I want.|sd
Right.|b
Now we've had one lately, um, oh, a, uh, a Dustbuster Plus --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we've had it for a while,|sd
but all of a sudden it just wasn't working,|sd
and it looks like there's a part missing from it.|sd
My husband opened it up and whatever,|sd
and of course we don't have the receipt any more,|sd
so we can't take it back|sd
Of course,|ba
uh-huh.|%
Uh, but, I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long --|sv
Right --|aa
-- uh,|%
-- right,|aa
just to get you by five years|sv
and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- We're, we're a wasteful society, for sure.|sv
Well, that's true,|aa
and lot of times though, it is, it costs so much to get something fixed --|sv
Right.|b
Right.|b
And you usually get what you pay for.|sv
We bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas,|sd
and they were like ten dollars,|sd
and we expected them to work nice for the little kids,|sd
and they didn't work --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So we took those back,|sd
and that's about that|sd
all that were taken back in ages.|sd
Well, yeah,|b
I think a lot of times, if you get a brand name --|sv
Yeah.|b
I, you, I think there's, there can be a lemon in anything --|sv
Right.|b
you, you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time,|sv
and, uh --|sv
Right.|b
I mean, we, we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law --|sd
Oh, really.|b
It's hard.|^2
We never could get it declared a lemon,|sd
and the car would go|sd
and, without any warning whatsoever, you could be going down the freeway at sixty|sd
and it would stop --|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
-- and I, -|%
there was just, -|%
you know, and, oh, we went round and round with the manufacturer and, and everything,|sd
and they got it finally semifixed,|sd
but it was such a hassle --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
and it just pertained to that|qy^d
-- yeah,|ny
yeah|ny
it, it really is, uh,|sd
but, gee, this is, of all the topics I have had, I'm doing this thing, this is kind of the strangest one.|sd
I, at first I thought of food, you know, because that's what, mainly what I buy,|sd
it seems like,|sd
and, uh, you know, I still don't have any, anything to do there,|sd
but,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
so. -|%
Well, I think that's true,|aa
and I, uh, now we generally don't buy a warranty, because you think, you know, at least for the first couple of years, nothing should go wrong with it.|sd
Yeah,|aa
my husband is really good at fixing things, too,|sd
so he usually, be able to fix anything that's minor,|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, but, it was interesting to,|%
I don't know if they're making them better or not,|sd
I, it's hard to say.|sv
Some, I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, -|sv
but I think the technology is better.|sv
Ye-, I think technology is better,|aa
I'm, I'm not sure.|h
I think --|sv
About quality.|sv
I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better --|sv
Right.|b
I, I, -|%
everything is so automated, uh,|sv
and things can be made without, I think --|sv
Yeah,|b
Yeah.|b
and I think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, you know, had some pride in it.|sv
Right.|aa
Well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, so, you know, for a handcrafted something,|sv
so -- -|%
Well, yeah,|aa
that's --|aa
-- so. -|%
So, if we get what we what we deserve|sv
Yeah,|b
well, I, I do, uh, you know, craft work and sell stuff at shows|sd
and that, and uh, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a real eye-opener as far as, you know, why people charge what they do to, you know.|sd
Well, you keep up with current events?|qy
Um, somewhat.|na
Yeah,|%
somewhat --|na
Not, -|%
-- not as well as I would like to probably --|sd
Is that right?|bh
-- but that's the way it goes.|sd
Yeah,|b
where, whereabouts in Pennsylvania.|qw
What?|br
Where in Pennsylvania?|qw
Um, State College,|sd
I go to Penn State.|sd
Oh, do you,|bk
well, great.|ba
Yep.|b
How's, uh, -|%
well no,|ar
we're not supposed to talk about that.|sd
We're supposed to talk about current events.|sd
Right,|aa
exactly, uh.|aa
Well, I'm a current event junkie.|sd
So I, I watch, I try to watch the news,|sd
and I read the newspaper,|sd
and I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world.|sd
I see.|b
Well, what particularly are you interested in?|qw
Well, I just, pretty, uh, little, you know, about everything. -|sd
And, not --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but you know, I like to know pretty well what's happening.|sd
Political things don't interest me a great deal, except I do like to stay informed enough to, feel like I halfway vote intelligently, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, uh, other than that, uh, I just, you know, -|sd
just the events that happen around the world interest me.|sd
Yeah.|b
Now I have to say all three of my children, none of them are too interested in current events.|sd
I see.|b
But I always have been --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I stay up with it.|sd
But, uh, how do you, how do you, uh, stay aware of most of the current events. Uh, newspaper?|qo
Um --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I read, I read the newspapers sometimes --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I watch C N N, that sort of thing --|sd
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
that's good.|ba
-- and I read magazines, and such.|sd
Well, you stay up with it pretty well, then.|bf
Well, yeah,|aa
I mean, not, not that badly --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so I am, I am interested in what's going on,|sd
and I'm particularly interested in certain things of course, like all the news about Haiti recently --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yes,|b
uh-huh.|b
Oh, you've been there --|bh
-- and, yeah.|ny
-- well, you would be interested in it then.|sv
Right,|aa
exactly.|aa
Yeah, uh,|b
I follow it, you know,|sd
I don't just read everything about it,|sd
but I'm always aware of what's going on like that --|sd
Yep,|b
-- and, uh, because it is, it's interesting --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I don't know,|h
I feel sorry for those people down there,|sd
they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many, many years, you know.|sv
That's true.|aa
They've never really had a good leader,|sv
I mean he was --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I think it's been better since he died,|sv
but it's still been bad --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- but, uh, even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew, uh,|sd
I've read some things about him that he was, he wasn't too good himself.|sd
Oh, yeah?|bh
Yeah,|ny
he was pretty, pretty much a, -|%
he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh,|sv
I see.|b
Uh-huh.|b
but, uh, but then again, who, you know, -|%
those people are so used to it|sv
I guess it's the only thing that works.|sv
Yeah,|b
so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America?|qo
I think it's pretty darned good,|sv
I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- I really do.|sd
Now, I, they sometimes they jump on it and, and, and go a little to the extreme,|sv
the media does,|sv
but, uh, but, that's kind of understandable, because, you know, of course if you watch it more, more than once a day, I mean, it's the same thing over and over and over and over,|sv
and I listen to the radio --|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
-- so I, you hear so much,|sv
you get a little tired of it,|sv
but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe --|sv
Yep.|b
-- but I think the quality of our, uh, our news is just, uh, I don't believe it could be better --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- I really don't.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, you know, I think it probably could be, it always could be better,|ar
but I,|aa
I don't think so.|ar
I don't think our news could be better.|sv
Yeah.|b
I, I mean, I mean, what else could they do to make it better.|qh
Um.|b
I don't see anything that they could do.|sv
Yeah,|b
well, I think that, um, -|sv
I don't know.|h
Well, you always --|sv
The, um, -|%
Right.|aa
-- I understand what you're saying,|ba
Right,|aa
I think that,|sd
But by trial and error over the years, I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it.|sv
Well, that may be so,|aa
yeah.|%
Uh --|sv
I think that --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, that's true,|aa
I understand what you're saying,|ba
and then again, I understand why they can't dig too much deeper,|sd
that's why we have C N N.|sv
Right.|b
C N N has the time, since that's all they do is news --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Uh, well, I, I guess it's a subject I haven't thought too much about.|sd
Uh, I don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools, uh, as much as,|sv
Uh, that might be a lot to do with it.|aa
I know a lot of it here in my state, -|sd
I'm from Mississippi,|sd
I'm not sure where you're from.|qw^d
Minnesota, Wisconsin.|sd
Minnesota,|bk
okay.|bk
Well a lot of it in Mississippi here has got to do with funding.|sd
Yeah.|b
Problems with our educational system, a lot of it's due to money.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they're trying to spend money where we don't have it|sd
and there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, it's, it is getting very expensive to run schools,|sv
so. -|%
Well it is.|aa
They've got computers now that you got to train on.|sd
There's just --|sv
Right.|b
That's true.|aa
And a lot of it, lot of it has to do with, uh, salaries too, speaking --|sv
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
Cause if you can't pay the right people, you know, they're not to be able to do, they're not, not going to get the people that can do a good job.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
I, I, I guess that in, uh, -|%
talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools, I, I think they're expecting schools to discipline the kids|sv
and, uh, I think it should go right back to the parents.|sv
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
I feel the same way.|sd
A lot has to do with how the kids were raised at home.|sv
Right,|aa
yeah.|aa
And then when the kids get to school, they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids.|sv
I mean, they've so severely limited|sv
what disciplinary action you can do.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
I, I know when I, uh, was going to school it wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving.|sd
Exactly.|aa
Right.|aa
I mean they do that now|sv
and they could probably lose their job|sv
Lose their job and big lawsuit and all that.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah|aa
I feel that's got a lot to do with it.|sv
People aren't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
Yeah|aa
It seems that'd be a subject that I, I don't have much to say on|sd
Really.|b
We, we've talked some about it in my state because we've had a lot of, uh, prob-, -|sd
our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education|sd
but he wasn't.|sd
Yeah.|b
And a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly.|sd
I know a lot, a lot of, -|%
if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, unfortunately, there's not many places to get that money.|sv
Yeah|b
Then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different , -|sv
I know one of my physics professors at college has addressed this.|sd
That most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level aren't scientists,|sv
they're teachers.|sv
And they may not know a lot about what they're teaching.|sv
Where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses|sv
and they're trying to teach social studies.|sv
And they don't know a lot about that|sv
Right.|b
Where maybe a physics professor, -|sv
he, my professor was a physics professor|sd
and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level.|sd
So therefore, they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view.|sv
And that causes a lot of trouble.|sv
Right.|aa
Yeah.|aa
I don't know,|h
e-, e-, maybe they should sit back and, and kind of, uh, decide on where the money's best spent.|sv
I know in a lot of cases, uh, different districts like to have nice fancy schools.|sv
Right.|b
And maybe they should be a little more, uh, uh, concerned with paying the right people to teach and, and be, uh, satisfied with maybe a little older school.|sv
Exactly.|aa
Because, I mean, here in the town I went to high school,|sd
one of the, there were four high schools in my county, one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado.|sd
So when they rebuilt that school, they had a, a top of the line, high tech school there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties|sd
and then when, uh, the evaluation committees came through, they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones. Telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building|sd
and this and this and this and so it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Well I, I know, uh, where I came from. We didn't have a very, uh, rich community|sd
and, uh, high school that I went to was very old|sd
and, uh, as far as I know, it's still there.|sd
They've e-, expanded on it|sd
but they've never built a new one|sd
and it's probably fifty, sixty years old or, or better|sd
and --|sd
Right.|b
Exactly|aa
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Um, what type of magazines do you have?|qo
We take several at home.|sd
I, I take, um, SKIING MAGAZINE,|sd
and I take, uh, DISCOVER magazine, and also, uh, C D AND STEREO REVIEW --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, .|b
Oh, good.|ba
That's a good one, I like to get|ba
Um, so I take it that you like to ski.|qy^d
Do you, do you, um, receive a lot of information on skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE?|qy
I presume that I do.|na
Uh-huh.|bk
Uh, I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because I do get things --|sd
Oh.|b
Oh, uh, and do you receive discounts and things like that,|qy
do you think -|qy
or, -|%
Uh, not so much that, I, uh, more likely to see those at a ski show or something,|ng
but --|sd
Oh.|bk
Some fashions --|sd
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So would this vacation you're taking, -|qy
did you receive information from your skiing magazine?|qy
Probably not.|ng
Uh, we already knew we wanted to take one,|sd
and we just started looking around.|sd
I may have referred to a couple of them,|sd
but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the --|sd
Oh.|bk
Oh.|bk
We haven't been there before.|sd
Um, that sounds nice.|ba
Kind of away from the crowd --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's --|sd
Oh.|b
But I haven't skied Utah yet,|sd
but I want to.|sd
Oh, well, you need to come out|ad
I'd like to go to Sundance and Park City --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I understand Deer Valley is nice, too.|sd
Deer Valley,|b
uh-huh.|aa
Yeah,|aa
they are, -|aa
it's wonderful snow|sv
Well, how about you,|qo
what, what magazines do you have at home?|qo
Uh, I am currently taking DECORATIVE WOODWORKING, and, uh, COUNTRY LIVING,|sd
and, let's see, we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,|sd
and then we have some church magazines,|sd
but I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING.|sd
I'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that,|sd
so --|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
Does it have, uh, articles on how to do things --|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Uh-huh,|ny
they do have, uh, mostly they have, uh, the ads on the equipment,|sd
but the whole magazine is just filled with, uh, pictures and projects that you can make yourself,|sd
and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project, and, and then how to paint it with the tole paintings,|sd
and so, it's really a fun one.|sd
I like that.|sd
Well, that's good.|ba
It's good to get use out of one.|sv
Uh-huh|aa
I'm not sure that, um, in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, -|%
I mean, I read it,|sd
but then they just sort of gather dust for a --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find --|sd
Uh-huh|b
Yeah.|b
Yes.|aa
I've, I've noticed that, too,|aa
but they have been nice to have around.|sv
Every once in a while they come in handy|sv
I used to take SMITHSONIAN --|sd
Oh.|b
I liked that magazine --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but it was, I was, just found myself not ever getting around to reading it.|sd
Oh. Uh.|b
You get so many coming in,|sv
and by the time the next round comes in I'm still not through reading the first round.|sd
Oh, that.|b
Oh, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house, too, I forgot,|sd
and that's --|sd
Oh.|b
but --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, well that sounds like. -|%
And he takes GAMES MAGAZINE --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- he likes to try that,|sd
so. He does, uh, does get to be a lot of paper though,|sd
after a while --|sv
Uh-huh|b
They do, they can do that.|aa
I found that they've been fun for my little girls,|sd
they're five and four years old,|sd
and they like to go through|sd
and, -|%
Oh, yeah,|b
they're just kind of getting started now.|qy^d
Uh-huh. They like to cut the pictures out and paste them on,|ny
and so we've found good use for those.|sd
Mine is a senior in high school,|sd
so he's, we're kind of at the end of that trail.|sd
Oh.|b
You're just --|qy^d
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|ny
it's fun.|sd
Well, I do have a boy in junior high, too,|sd
so -- -|%
Oh, okay,|bk
so you got a little bit of a gap there between, -|bf
-- so we're kind of running the gamut|sd
Yeah.|%
Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
what, do you do artistic painting?|qy
Uh, I do tole painting.|ng
Oh, you do?|bh
Uh-huh,|ny
I really love the tole painting.|sd
Uh, I haven't done any of the oil or watercolor.|sd
I would like to learn that someday,|sd
but right now my passion is tole painting|sd
Do you do a lot of it?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
I, I took one class about, I guess three or four years ago|sd
and I've done a little, uh,|sd
Oh.|bk
But it takes a lot of time|sv
It does,|aa
it is real time consuming|aa
and, -|%
D-, do you sell your projects?|qy
Uh, mostly I have just given them away as gifts.|ng
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I've done, uh, perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and, oh, on and on, you know, just things like that,|sd
but --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Where do you work at?|qw
I just work at Stop and Shop out there in, in Ogden|sd
so, -|%
Now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique?|qy
No,|nn
I've wanted to do that, uh, but just haven't, just haven't mass produced enough to do that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, I have five children of my own,|sd
so it's -- -|%
That keeps you busy.|sv
-- they, they keep me busy|aa
and tole painting is just a, you know, something I do in my spare time|sd
so -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Have you tried any of the, -|qy
well, do you cut out your own projects?|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh,|ny
I have my own saws|sd
and so I really enjoy doing that.|sd
Huh. Do you, uh, ever spray your projects with the, I mean a base coat first|qy
or do you brush it on?|qrr
I brush it on,|sd
yeah,|%
I haven't tried a, a spray varnish.|sd
I use just a wood sealer.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
I just bought a spray gun, one of those airless, uh, not airless, high volume, low pressure spray guns.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
And I do a lot of woodworking|sd
and --|sd
Do you?|bh
Oh.|b
But I haven't used it yet.|sd
Oh, well that's that 'ud probably give you a smoother finish, wouldn't it?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Oh.|bk
Yeah.|ny
Now what type of woodworking do you do?|qo
Uh, fine furniture.|sd
Oh --|bh
Yeah.|b
That's why I brought, bought the sprayer --|sd
Oh.|b
That's my worst, worst part of my woodworking.|sd
I get so sick of making|sd
Oh, but it's hard to finish it, huh.|qy
Yeah,|ny
but spraying does put on a nicer finish.|sd
Oh, well, that is interesting.|ba
So, what kind of equipment do you have?|qo
For woodworking?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Uh, let me see,|^h
table saw, scroll saw, band saw, lathe, routers,|sd
and -t's about it.|sd
Boy, it sounds like you're really into it.|bf
That is nice.|ba
Yeah,|aa
it is.|aa
Yeah,|b
I, I just have a scroll saw and a jig saw|sd
and I am really anxious to get a band saw and a router|sd
Yeah,|b
the band saw is really nice.|sv
I have an Inca.|sd
I don't know if you've ever heard of those.|qy^d
Oh.|b
But it's nice to have the right equipment.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that is, that makes it easier, doesn't it?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Well, have you sold any of your furniture|qy
or --|%
Uh --|%
-- not, -|%
mostly I do like you do, give it away as gifts.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But,|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh, that's interesting.|ba
Do you, uh, did you take classes to learn how to do that?|qy
Uh, just in junior high --|na
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then I just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment, kept up with that.|sd
Oh, so yours is mostly just a hobby, too, then.|bf
Yeah.|aa
Oh.|b
Yeah.|aa
Well, that is interesting.|ba
Oh, I would, I really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to.|sd
I don't know if I necessarily want to do furniture,|sd
but mostly, uh, just --|sd
Like --|qy^d
Uh-huh,|ny
the woodworking.|sd
For your --|qy^d
Uh,|b
Yeah|ny
Yeah,|b
so, it's fun|sv
Good.|ba
Well I guess I'll let you go now.|fc
Well, they come on,|fc
we're supposed to talk until they come on and --|fc
Oh, they do?|fc
Okay,|fc
so this is my first one.|fc
You're probably a veteran --|fc
Yeah.|fc
Well, it has, it has been really fun.|fc
I've enjoyed this. Uh,|fc
like I say, I've made a couple of calls to Texas, and --|fc
Uh-huh.|fc
so I think you'll enjoy doing it.|fc
Yeah.|fc
It's fun.|fc
Sounds fun.|fc
Where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here?|fc
Uh, you know, there's a shop in Roy that I really love.|fc
Uh, and it's there by the, Copper Mill restaurant, used to be the Hayloft.|fc
I am not famil-, -|%
well, we live in Roy|fc
, but, we haven-, -|%
is it on nineteen hundred?|fc
Uh-huh.|fc
Uh, let's see,|fc
I'm trying to think of the name.|fc
I know where fifty-six hundred south is.|fc
Uh, I don't right off.|fc
Is that Ben Franklin then ?|fc
Ben Franklin,|fc
okay.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
you want to start?|ad
Yeah,|aa
I might as well.|aa
Uh, one of the things I'm very concerned about the air pollution, is the, uh, this, this, the ozone layer, uh, uh, issue.|sd
Uh, I used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of fre-, different types of freons,|sd
and that, uh, rather bothers me that, uh, I was in, in effect, uh, contributing to the delinquency of the, the environment, so to speak.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago.|sv
Right,|aa
right,|aa
and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven, twelve and thirteen, in, in, in that area was because they were inexpensive,|sd
uh, they could be made, uh, you know, inexpensive and lots of it, uh,|sd
and in that, and its properties were great, uh, with, uh, the machinery, didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to, uh, get your heating and cooling cycles to work.|sd
Um.|%
So. -|%
Have they stopped that practice now?|qy
Well, course there's a, a tremendous number of refrigerators and fre-, excuse me, refrigerators and freezers, both commercial and residential, uh, utilizing freon twelve,|sd
and of course, the new cars, I guess starting with ni-, nineteen ninety-three will not have freon twelve in their systems.|sv
But, uh, there's, you know, the ton of after market machines, and et cetera, et cetera.|sd
Yeah.|b
And that's got me very, you know, highly concerned that, uh, that's going to be quite a while before we can, uh,|sd
Now, that could spawn several good industries and help,|sv
but you got to have people that can make, you know, earn a salary to pay for this conversion.|sv
So, so I see us in a kind, somewhat of a catch twenty-two unless we, unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and, and come up with a way to, uh, have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting, uh, compound.|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
Because as I say, there's a, there's a tremen-, -|sv
well, how many, uh, uh, families own a refrigerator,|qh
and then do, you know, that number, and then how many a, a freezer separate from --|qh
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah|aa
yeah.|aa
I mean, this is, there, there are people that, that make it, have a thriving business, uh, that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on, on automobiles and trucks,|sv
and, uh, the only reason I didn't, uh, get into that more, when I was, had my little business, was because, uh, most of your, uh, air conditioning in, in, on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I mean, -|%
so, uh, that's why I stayed in, stayed more towar-, towards, uh, uh, -|sd
and that's a pollut-, polluting type deal too, is the excessive, um, you know, uh, petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth, and the dirt and grit and those two mixed together with, with water and, uh, like knocking on a really make, uh, make a mess.|sv
Um, yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
I hate to see a car going down the street, or even a truck or bus for that matter, that's putting out a lot of dark --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of --|sv
Right.|b
but that, that particular bothers me.|sd
Well, most, most, most of the time when you see bus, uh, you know, the busses with the diesel --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
because when you, when diesel is burned it's it, -|%
you know diesel fuel is burned in a, in the diesel engine|sd
it's burned so completely, that you don't have any, uh, nitrous oxides, uh, or oxides of nitrogen, uh, to, uh, form --|sd
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Diesel is going to be around, because it doesn't evaporate easily,|sd
and it's got, -|%
well, you know, its latent heat is high,|sd
but it's slow burning at, at, uh, normal pressures.|sd
That's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios --|sd
Oh, I see.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so if the car sucks in, uh, fifty degrees, -|%
Well, how do you feel about trial by jury?|qo
I feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently. Uh,|sd
In what way?|qw
In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than, uh, by evidence that's presented.|sd
I have, uh, very little regard for the law|sd
Oh, do, do you feel they are swayed more toward, are you talking about with criminal or civil suits?|qy
I was thinking primarily criminal cases.|sd
So, do you think that, I mean the the stereotypical bleeding heart juries --|qy
Yes.|ny
Uh-huh.|ny
That's a concern of mine.|sd
Uh, I would feel more comfortable in many cases I think with judges. Uh, you know, doing the sentencing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
The other thing, the only thing that really bothers me about that is I think you know, that a judge can be -|sv
I, I like the idea of juries of your peers --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And second of all, you get a wide variety of background|sv
so that, -|%
Yeah,|b
my question I guess are they really your peers?|qh
Uh-huh.|aa
I'd --|aa
Uh|sv
That's definitely a problem.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, when you, when you are selecting a jury and you are doing it partially if, if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I think that, uh, in such cases, uh, they are not really looking for unbiased people, but rather for biased.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, now I happen to know several judges|sd
and there is one that I would feel uncomfortable but has me-, doing sentencing without the jury|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but the other two I feel, uh, would give either you know, the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I guess that's what I am concerned with.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
I, guess I, I definitely agree with you,|aa
but sin-, the -|%
well, what I don't like about, uh, sentence, the jury doing the sentencing --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
the, the same crime gets unequal sentences.|sv
This is very true.|aa
I, uh, I think there is more of an ability of you know, you know for selecting a jury, two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea, uh, the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, I think, I think there would be a large variation in, in trying to gage the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and have that that measure stick across the board.|sv
Yeah|aa
and you do see such uneven sentencing --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
but one individual got twenty-five years|sv
and the other one was sentenced to life.|sv
So, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Uh,|b
Of course a lot of that's also the ability of, of the defendant to, uh, get a good lawyer.|sv
Isn't that the truth|aa
Uh-huh.|b
There are times when is it, uh,|%
oh goodness, my mind has gone blank it's, uh, Othello.|sd
You know where he says kill all the lawyers|qy^d
Every now and then one is tempted to see what, what.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I agree|aa
But, I, it's taken me a long time to understand that, uh, lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh|b
Oh, yeah,|aa
I, I agree with it|aa
yeah.|aa
They will admit to you that they can-, don't have the benefit of being able to you know, of, of, letting, allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument.|sv
And --|sv
That the -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, even, -|%
I have been involved, uh, just sli-, slightly in a case where I know the person is guilty --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, uh, his attorneys gotten him off.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, the city has dropped their charges against him because their, the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge.|sd
So I don't know|h
Yeah.|b
Uh, this is a little bit of the subject,|sv
but one, one thing that I really dislike, uh, also that's, that's new is the, uh, is that I have heard that there are federal sentences,|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
so, um, -|%
yes|%
we do keep, uh, well we started out keeping a budget about two years, ago,|sd
we have a computer, here at the house,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our, our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month|sd
and then basically since then what I've done is, is keep track of it through the checkbook|sd
so that based on whatever we've got coming in, the check coming in, then how much I'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also spe-, -|sd
because our house payment is once a month,|sd
that's our, our biggest, uh, expense|sd
so I take half of that amount out of my checkbook each, with each paycheck,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
A running total.|b
Yeah.|b
What do you all do?|qo
Uh, we've, we've, uh, taken how much we have, you know, write down how much we have coming in each month|sd
and then, uh, we've, -|%
at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend.|sd
We sat dow-, made up different accounts like, you know,|sd
we've set a budget for each, you know, household expenses, or food, and clothing and entertainment and then our, our own fun money and just stuff like that|sd
and then we write down each, each time we spend something, we write down in a book|sd
and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we, you know -|sd
we, we try to stay within a certain budget,|sd
so. -|%
Is it, is it hard to keep track of it|qy
or does it work out pretty well?|qrr
Um, it takes some, it takes some dedication to do it,|sd
but it, it works out real well,|sd
so. -|%
And, and you're staying within your budget and keep-,|qy^d
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
I stay wi-, I have to stay within it,|sd
so I, you know, -|%
and then we have that, you know, -|%
if you can't stay, if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have, uh, you know, a budget for, you know, like we call our slush fund or something|sd
and some-, an unexpected comes up, then you're not, you know, you don't feel it so strapped.|sv
You don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that.|bf
Right,|aa
yeah,|aa
because we don't, you know, we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month.|sd
That's a good choice,|ba
we've been trying, we're trying to, uh, do that this year.|sd
We've budgeted the money that we used to spend, we were spending on a CODA account with T I and then money we were also buying stock with for that year,|sd
we've taken that this year,|sd
to someone else in the You've got paper under your table.|t3
and, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and so we hope by the end of this year,|sd
To be out of that.|^2
Free.|b^m
Yeah,|b
the only thing we have, it to pay off is our, is a automobile loan and our house payment,|sd
and that's the only thing we ever, -|sd
That's good to be in that kind of shape.|ba
We try to stay out of debt|sd
What are you all trying to do long term.|qw
Huh. Oh it's long term.|^h
We just, -|%
he ha-, you know, his retirement plan and then to CODA and stuff like that, that's all we, -|sd
and you know, we just have our life insurance for right now.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, we don't have any long term, you know, in stocks, or anything like that right now,|sd
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
mostly what we're doing, we've worked, we've done the, uh, CODA account with T I where they, we put in so much a month,|sd
and then they, or so much a pay check and then they match it.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's what we're doing.|sd
So that's, that's worked out pretty good|sd
and then, I used to work for T I|sd
and I have, -|%
when I retired from there, or left, I took the money I that I had in mine and put it in an I R A|sd
and we had an out, we had an existing I R A|sd
so we have, both of us have some money in an I R A that we're also trying to figure, -|sd
to, put it, we're putting it in C D's right now,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund.|sd
Yeah,|b
when ever we get enough saved we stick it in a C D for a while|sd
and, then, uh, you know and then when, if we need it we wait until it, it's expired|sd
and then so, -|%
Yeah.|b
The other thing that we've done, that, that was really nice to see, we had one of the financial companies, um,|sd
han-, uh, John Hancock company came out|sd
and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and, uh, what we were pla-, what, what our, uh, goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement, kids college, paying off the house, buying a different house,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
or not,|^2
yeah.|%
Uh-huh.|b
That sounds interesting,|ba
we've never done any-, -|sd
we have, -|%
you know, just our, our life insurance guy has come out, you know,|sd
and he's set up, uh, you know, determined how much we need to, you know, we need if something were to happen.|sd
Yeah,|b
that, that's the other financial thing I guess that we've done is with our life insurance is, since I'm at home now is, is figuring out, uh, what we would need if something happened to my husband, or what he would need if something happened to me,|sd
that's a, a big thing to think about.|sv
Right,|aa
yeah, you know,|aa
if, I would sell the, you know, -|%
if, he, something would happen to him, I wouldn't stay in Texas,|sd
I would, uh, sell the house and move back home, you know, to my home town,|sd
and, and, uh, I wouldn't stay here in Texas,|sd
so you know, I don't know what he would do.|sd
Okay,|b
I guess that's most of my, um, financial plans right now.|sd
Yeah|b
mine too.|sd
Is, is there anything you'd like to add?|qy
No,|nn
that's about all for mine.|sd
Well it's been nice talking to you.|fc
Nice talking to you too.|fc
Bye, bye|fc
Bye, bye.|fc
Go ahead.|ad
Oh, um, uh, I usually don't get to hea-, hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, you know, being, uh, -|%
I mean, by the time you get off work, go by and pick up the, uh, baby from the baby sitter, it's, you know, after six|sd
and by the time everything is settled in,|sd
it's ten o'clock before I can catch up on anything.|sd
Yeah,|b
I guess that's the way I am too.|sd
I, sometimes I hear some things on, on the radio.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
oh yeah.|b
I only get the newspaper on the weekends|sd
so -|%
Oh, uh-huh.|b
Oh, I don't even have, ge-, time to read the newspaper except in passing, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
you know, I'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on.|sd
I,|sd
But, uh, -|%
Yeah.|b
We have, uh, a news thing on the computer that, uh, that I'll, I'll try to look at every day.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, it, it's pretty much headline news.|sd
Yeah.|b
Which isn't, you know, pretty much what we loo-, look for anyway.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh. I, do you think that the quality of the, uh, the, you know, the news events that you get are, -|sv
what do you think about it?|qo
Well I, I guess it's pretty good.|sv
And, and like the Dallas area, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
and I, I guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this,|sv
there's, I guess, a lot of pressure in that business to,|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, you know, there's a lot of competition in the media.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And sometimes I think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines. And that they'll run a topic into the ground.|sv
Yeah.|b
And, uh. You know, they try to play public's opinion. Which I think is awful, because it usually works.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
true.|aa
I'll bet that was the case of the, the war in the Middle East.|sv
Yes,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
That, -|%
uh, l-, lots of new, uh, newsmen were created during that|sv
so, it will be interesting to see what happens.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
true.|aa
Trying to think what else is,|^h
Right.|b
Uh, uh,|b
Well, um, I don't know what to say|sd
Uh, that's a bad one,|ba
they, uh, -|%
looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas,|sv
Yeah,|aa
I hate to see that,|sd
but it's, uh, i-, that, you know, if what it's going to take, -|%
well, you know, we can deduct that from our income tax, our federal income tax.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, you know, but we need good schools.|sv
Uh, we're more involved in that now.|sv
And, I, I, I, I think it's better for everybody if we had better schools.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
So, -|%
I would think they could find a better way to fund it though,|sv
but they haven't for, -|%
No.|aa
You know, I wish they could have gotten a lottery.|sd
Well, they're struggling with it.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I think, you know, the lottery could have helped, with that.|sv
I mean, it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax.|sv
I mean, probably would have paid the same amount|sv
but, you know, it's not the idea of your paying, uh, income tax.|sv
Uh-huh.|aa
True.|ba
So, -|%
I, I'm not sure there's a positive solution for that.|sv
No.|aa
It'll be interesting to see what happens.|sv
Trying to think what else is current.|^h
I, you know, I haven't seen the news in a couple of days.|sd
So it, uh, -|%
I'm a little behind on things.|sd
Well, the other thing I can think of is, uh, what is still going on in Iraq --|sd
Yes,|b
that's, that's sad.|ba
Yeah.|b
They, uh, yeah, they had to choose between the better of the two, two bad situations,|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and,|sv
Yeah.|b
Right.|aa
But I understand why Bush, you know, doesn't want to go in and, and uh, take sides.|sd
I mean, because that would definitely look like another Korea,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and he'd have all these people jumping down his back, even though I'd agree with it.|sv
I think he ought to, should've gone in there and blew them away.|sv
Seems to have helped him though,|sv
Yeah, it, it,|aa
He did a real good job I believe.|sv
I have, uh, in-laws that live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too.|sd
Hm.|b
It, uh, it, uh, you know, -|%
we, so we kept very much abreast of what was going on.|sd
Yeah.|b
Were, were they in any of the areas where they,|qy
Yeah,|ny
they were on|sd
Um.|b
Um-hum.|b
Yeah.|b
They were just north of it.|sd
Um.|b
Uh, and they stayed active was the, uh, the military there. Taking supplies out to them in the desert.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It was, it was a new situation.|sd
Yeah.|aa
I'll bet.|ba
I don't really have much more to say|sd
I don't know anything else that's current other than the weather|sd
and, -|%
You're right,|aa
and that's, that's awful in Texas|sv
Have, have you all been getting rain storms down there?|qy
We got some awful rain, uh, the other morning.|na
And today's just been real drizzly.|sd
We did, we did last night. Uh, some real massive thunderstorms.|sd
Yeah.|b
Apparently, I, I don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Caused some damage.|sd
It did?|bh
We may get some more tonight.|sd
Oh, well. We, we've just got slight chances of rain.|sd
But, uh, we had the, we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning.|sd
Course while everybody was getting ready to go to work. Making nice traffic jams.|sd
So -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Well the, the ground here is so flat,|sd
and it's all saturated now,|sd
Oh|b
we're getting some flooding.|sd
Right,|b
uh, when was it, last week, we had all the rain?|t1
But, uh, -|%
we, I think we had about eight inches.|sd
Hm.|b
It was between six and eight inches here where we are.|sd
Goodness.|ba
And, uh, it, you walk out on the ground, -|sd
I mean you, -|%
I mean, it's awful.|sd
It's just so soggy.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's a lot more humid down that way.|sv
Yeah|b
In fact, miserable.|sv
Well, today it was, I mean, the air was just so sticky, so damp.|sd
Yeah,|b
I think there were places around downtown Fort Worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time, like an hour or so just,|sd
Goodness.|ba
Well, I guess that's it|fc
Right.|fc
Well it's,|fc
That's about as much as we can do with current events.|fc
Right.|fc
Well, it was nice talking to you.|fc
Good talking to you, Michelle.|fc
All right.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
The public school systems, well everybody's kno-, has known they've needed renovation for years, but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
The first direction that I can see, or I wish, I would love to see them go with.|sv
Kids learn at different rates|sv
and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together.|sv
You'd learn at this rate|^q
and that's the only way it's going to happen.|^q
Yeah.|aa
That's true|aa
You've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it,|sv
and the re-, the other fifty-seven minutes you've been talking about a subject, you've bored them.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
that's, that's very true.|aa
Um, I guess I can relate to that, because I have two kids that are opposites like that.|sd
Uh, one picks up real quick|sd
and the other one doesn't.|sd
And you're right, they do get bored, uh, really fast, if they already know what you're talking about.|aa
What do you propose that they do?|qo
What, what is your suggestions?|qw
The educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with, uh, the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Out of each child.|b
Out of each child.|b^m
Each individual child.|b
Some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff.|sv
Other kids are going to be really into math,|sv
some are really going to be heavy into reading.|sv
Right.|b
Instead of pushing the scales too far either direction, I mean it's great to be well rounded and hav-, be exposed to all this stuff.|sv
Yeah.|aa
That's, -|%
But why not hit the points the kid's really interested in?|qh
Because if he's interested, he's going to study it,|sv
and he's going to learn it,|sv
and he's going to remember it.|sv
That's true.|aa
The only, I think the only thing that they would argue about that, is that, you know, every child needs to learn every subject.|sv
I mean, that's, that might be the only thing.|sv
But, I mean, I, I definitely agree with you. Uh,|aa
They need exposure to every subject.|sv
They don't need to be masters of it,|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
That's true. Uh,|aa
Everything I learned about ancient Rome ha-, has not helped me anywhere in,|sv
Yes,|aa
I definitely agree.|aa
There's no doubt about that.|aa
I, uh, I, I mean, I can relate to that because I'm, I'm going to college right now,|sd
and I feel like, I mean, I'm taking this history class.|sd
And, I mean, it's so boring,|sd
and I just hate it.|sd
And I think, why do they make us take this stuff?|sd
I mean, what does this have to do with getting, you know, a computer science degree or whatever, you know?|qh
What, what type of history class is it that you're having to take?|qw
Uh, American History.|sd
We have to take, um, like this is like early seventeen hundreds through, I don't know, I think like mid eighteen hundreds.|sd
And then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up, to basically present.|sd
Well, the early ones they could actually combine two, two,|sv
Yeah.|b
Combine that into one. And then from eighteen sixty-five to present,|sv
and make that your second step because,|sv
Yeah.|b
That's, well that's,|sd
and, but even then they're skimming over,|sv
they're very, tri-, almost trivial with it.|sv
Yeah,|aa
oh, yes.|aa
Definitely,|aa
I agree.|aa
Yeah,|aa
there's, -|%
You know, I mean, if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter, I mean, there's, they make all these people out to be, oh, -|sv
they were great men,|sv
and they're the father of the country and all this.|sv
He had just as much dirt on him as anybody else.|sv
If not more.|sv
The man was not a saint.|sv
Yeah.|aa
That's true,|aa
yeah.|aa
Any way, this, this, um, school system thing, -|%
I, I tell you, I saw something on the news, oh, I don't know, maybe two weeks ago.|sd
And they were talking about, -|sd
I don't know where you're from,|qw^d
but I'm from the Dallas area.|sd
And they were talking about the Plano school system, that, they had one school that, uh, if the students did something wrong, I mean, whether it was behavioral or, uh, you know, they weren't learning properly or something. They took these students and put them basically in a closet. With no windows.|sd
They had, a, a table, or not a table, but a desk in this closet,|sd
and they had to sit in there by themselves.|sd
Well, parents were getting really angry about this, because they said, Why is my child being put in this closet.|sd
Well, how is that helping my child, you know.|^q
And, uh, the, the thing, you know, -|%
they said, Well, we're giving them isolation time|sd
and this helps them to think.|^q
But a lot of kids, -|%
I mean, if a child has, uh, claustrophobia, I mean, that's just going to terrify him, you know|sv
and, -|%
If, if the isolation concept really works that good, why are our prisons overcrowded?|qh
Uh, that's true.|aa
That's true.|aa
But, no,|%
I mean, they were, uh, I mean, -|%
I definitely agree with parents.|sd
I think that is a very wrong way to handle, uh, disciplining a child.|sv
Putting them in, I mean, they were, they were call-, they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms.|sd
They didn't call them closets.|sd
But they showed these rooms on, uh, you know, on the news|sd
and, I mean, they looked like a closet to me. You know, with a desk in it, a real small.|sd
But they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms.|sd
I said, now what good does thi-, I mean, how is this helping?|sd
I mean, either way. You know, I, I definitely had to disagree with that.|sd
I think that is, that's not the way to handle a child, you know, discipline a child by putting him in a closet|sv
Th-, the as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev-, the public school system I want to see changed too.|sd
When I was br-, brought up, if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough, you were going to get spanked.|sd
Right.|b
Well, then the extreme came in,|sv
and now we can no longer,|sv
Right.|b
so we now isolate them.|sv
Yep.|b
Uh|b
Okay,|b
we've swung the pendulum both ways.|sv
Let's find a middle ground.|sv
Instead of, there has to be some sort of discipline,|sv
and there has to be some sort of punishment.|sv
Right.|b
Well, -|%
Let's put him into a situation where, okay, you crossed the line, you broke the rule, you're going to have to pay for it.|sv
Right.|b
But, it's going to tax you physically.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I, I don't, -|%
Have th-, I mean, in-, instead ha-, have them pick up around the school yard, have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yar-. Do something to beautify the school property.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
But you cut, you know, -|%
the, the kid's having to give up his, quote, play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong.|sv
Well, -|%
But he's seeing something constructive come out of it.|sv
um, I have to, -|%
I think one of the positive things, I mean, one of the things that can come out of, uh, is not just di-, discipline, okay?|sv
But, okay,|%
for instance, one of the things they do at, uh, my kids school, uh, they have what they call, uh, caught being good slips.|sd
And when the kids are in halls and stuff, and if they're being really good, I mean, just being excellent, they're not, you know, cutting up and so on.|sd
They're just standing in line, doing whatever they are supposed to,|sd
they get one of these caught being good slips.|sd
And then, when they collect them at the end of each week, they get to go to this little, what they call their caught being good store,|sd
and then they get to spend these like money.|sd
Well, see, to me, that's positive reinforcement, is much better, much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids, because they're going to be good and try and earn those things, you know, to get the positive part of it.|sv
I mean, they'd ra-, much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked.|sv
So, they're definitely going to work towards being good, you know, rather than trying to act up and be bad, you know.|sv
I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself.|sv
We've been too long, there's been too much negative reinforcement.|sv
How much, da-, like, the caught being good slips. -|%
How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street?|qh
Yeah,|aa
well that's true. I think, I think, really though,|aa
I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be spanked.|sd
But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also.|sd
And it really helps.|sd
And I mean, they, they don't get spanked very often,|sd
but they, they do when they deserve it, you know.|sd
But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked.|sv
I mean, I, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child.|sd
But, you know, that's just my personal opinion,|sd
and that's not going to, -|%
I mean, I don't think that law will ever change.|sv
They are never going to let a, a teacher spank a child again.|sv
But I don't think, -|%
I mean, some kids don't get don't get spanked at home|sv
and some kids need to be spanked at home.|sv
I mean, don't you think?|qy
I, m-, m-, most wholeheartedly agree.|na
But I don't know.|h
I mean, there's a point of over kill,|sv
but somewhere in, you've got to find an even line.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
Well, there's so many parents that say, you can deal with a child without spanking them. Which is true, you can.|sv
But there are times when a child needs to be spanked.|sv
I mean, they do things that they need that.|sv
Need that shock effect, where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked.|sv
Right. ends with no further|b
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Um, I guess what, I guess my task. -|sd
I usually ride my bike.|sd
I have, uh, a stationary bike and, uh, a regular bike.|sd
And when I can, I like to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much nicer.|sd
The stationary bike is, is so, uh,|sv
Boring.|^2
But I have head phones,|sd
and I, plus I have it, uh, in the living room|sd
so I either watch T V,|sd
so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied.|sd
If, I like to have the T V on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied.|sd
It kind of takes the time away|sd
and I don't realize, really, that's really the only time I ever watch T V, is when I'm on the bike.|sd
But, and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know,|sd
and that just kind of gets myself, uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess.|sd
But it's definitely a task.|sd
You think so?|bh
I can't say that I really enjoy it.|sd
I wish that I did enjoy it more,|sd
but I do it because I have to not because I want to|sd
I bought a stationary bike,|sd
but I find that if I sit on that seat too long, it hurts.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
And I haven't figured how to get that soft,|sd
and I tried even tying a pillow to it.|sd
But two years ago, I joined, well, it's not quite two years, it's almost two years, I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I love it.|sd
Really?|bh
I just love it.|sd
So is it just women that go there?|qy
Yeah.|ny
It's totally women.|sd
See, I think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place, uh, a, a health club.|sd
Because I don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise.|sd
You know, so I have tried to just do stuff at home|sd
and, uh, I just feel conscious about it.|sd
I mean, I'm not big, you know, or anything,|sd
but I still don't like other people watching me.|sd
I like to be able to sweat, have my hair a mess.|sd
Yeah.|b
Right.|b
And I, my bathing suit's just one piece,|sd
so there's no big deal all the way around,|sv
but --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And it's, uh, oh, it's just, I don't know, it's, it's a total free relaxation.|sv
Because, hey, you can do what you want.|sv
You're a female,|sv
and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing.|sv
That's what, -|%
And they've got such fantastic equipment in there.|sd
Really?|bh
That's,|ba
Oh, yeah.|ny
How, -|%
And I love the water aerobics.|sd
I love the water aerobics.|sd
Do they have a pool|qy
or what is, -|%
Oh, yeah.|ny
They've got a nice one.|sd
Huh.|b
They have two types of water aerobics.|sd
They call it aqua exercise, I guess is what they call it.|sd
I've heard that that's really good for you to do.|sd
It pushes you because you're pushing against the water --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So it is like double strenuous.|sd
But you're not being double strenuous on your own body.|sd
Because you're pushing it yourself.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So you're doing it yourself.|sd
So you don't really feel like you're really working that hard, do you?|qy
Huh-uh.|nn
When you're in the water?|qy
Huh-uh.|nn
The only thing that I ever felt was, every time I stop and start going again, because I end up getting two jobs once in a while.|sd
I end up having to quit for a while.|sd
But I get blisters on my toes on the bottom because,|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
Well, that's funny,|ba
I never would have thought of that.|sd
Well, a lot of people wear those little, uh, terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom. Especially around the pool.|sd
So they just --|sd
Like wat-,|qy
Is that, -|%
Yeah.|ny
They're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with --|sd
Oh, okay,|bk
okay.|bk
Okay,|bk
okay.|bk
no big deal one way or the other.|sv
Huh, that's really funny|ba
But, I never think about it until after you go there for about a week, your toes, you start getting blisters anyway.|sd
So no big deal.|sv
Huh, that's, -|%
But it's fun.|sd
So, how often do find yourself going?|qw
Um, on a, if you're doing it on a regular basis, how often do you go?|qw
I try to make it at least three times a week.|sd
Yeah.|b
That's really, -|%
For a while I was doing it every day. Just,|sd
Really?|bh
I wish that I could make myself exercise every day.|sd
But I do force myself to do it at least three times a week. Which I don't feel like is enough,|sd
but i-, it's, it's at least something.|sd
You know, it, it, -|%
I just force, I have to force myself to do it, like I said, because to me, I really don't enjoy it.|sd
But I know that I have to do it.|sd
I mean it's just, it's, it's not a question of whether I want to, you know.|sd
Well, -|%
But, -|%
When I was working up at, uh, The Summit,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock.|sd
Oh, that's, -|%
so I was there by four thirty, every night.|sd
And the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Because no matter what I did or how I did it, I invariably got myself wet.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But the water only comes up basically to your, anywhere from your waist to your, oh, chest, I'd say.|sd
Yeah.|b
So I mean, it's your choice where you want to go,|sd
but,|sd
Did you ever, -|%
Well, I'm sorry|fa
That's okay.|bd
Uh, did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for T I?|qy
Did you --|qy
I have a,|ng
so I'm very limited what I do.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
It's like I can walk,|sd
but if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me.|sd
Um.|b
Especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard,|sd
it will bother me.|sd
Then that would,|sv
yeah.|%
it will bother me.|aa
I guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you, wouldn't it?|qy
Well, that, what pushed me that way though, was basically was the fact that when I went in there, is wasn't for the water aerobics.|arp_nd
I went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles.|sd
Oh.|bk
And, uh, she said, Hey, go for the swimming pool.|sd
She says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor.|sd
She says in fact you get more.|sd
Wow.|ba
I said, okay, because I'm not a swimmer.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I like water.|sd
I'm not scared of it.|sd
But I couldn't,|sd
I guess I could swim across the pool,|sd
but I'm no swimmer per se.|sd
Yeah.|b
But I found that this worked really well.|sd
And I came out of there|sd
and I saw my stomach going down well.|sd
Oh.|b
I dropped, oh, I'd say almost twenty pounds.|sd
Wow.|ba
And they fix you up with a diet, which worked real good.|sd
What if you're already on one?|qw
I mean, -|%
What?|qw
A diet?|qy
Yeah.|ny
I mean, when you go in there, they wouldn't make you do theirs. Would they?|qy
Oh, no,|nn
they have nothing to do with that.|sd
Okay.|bk
See I joined, uh, when this one down here opened up, I joined as a V I P.|sd
And the V I P gives you, uh, oh, gives you a diet, a computerized diet.|sd
And they go over all your health and all your history,|sd
and they show you how, everything to do, and how to do it, and the whole nine yards.|sd
So it became part of the package,|sd
so I went through it.|sd
It worked out well.|sd
But they have packages where they just offer the exercise program.|qy^d
Is that what you're saying?|qy
Oh, yeah.|ny
You can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too.|sd
I see,|bk
okay.|bk
I just went and took the, because they were offering it as an opening benefit,|sd
so it was, it's less than what you pay now for going in there,|sd
Um.|b
So it's like when I got laid off,|sd
I went back in there, and start all over again because it had been a while since I'd done it.|sd
Um.|b
So I get all the same treatment again.|sd
So it's kind of nice.|sd
Wow.|ba
That's, -|%
Like I said, I like it.|sd
I like the heat.|sd
I like the, -|%
I jump out of the swimming pool,|sd
and I go into the hot tub.|sd
Oh|b
And I love it.|sd
Yeah.|b
That would be really nice|sv
Because I have n-, I have never, -|%
let me reword that,|oo_co_cc
I think I have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore.|sd
But that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's, -|%
I knew I was pushing too far.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But usually, when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming, or when I come out, I'm totally relaxed when I go home.|sd
It's no big deal.|sd
So you really do enjoy your exercise then, since your, -|bf
It's fun.|aa
It's fun.|aa
Uh, I've gotten on the bike.|sd
And they've got, uh, the stepping bike, where you step.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I've enjoyed that, watching how well I can walk up and down stairs.|sd
That's, you know, -|%
I wanted,|sd
But most of the others to me are very dull.|sv
but I got talked into the bike instead.|sd
And I don't know,|h
I really wanted a stepper.|sd
I'm considering maybe even buying one of those too.|sd
But I'm not sure if I'll get benefit out of both of them.|sd
I mean, I don't know if it would really do any good having both of them.|sd
Which one do you feel is better, since you use them both?|qw
Um, I get bored very easily.|sd
Uh, the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit.|sv
Like you said, you can sit and do it, and watch the T V and not even really be conscious of what you are doing.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
With the stepper, you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down.|sd
Huh.|b
So you have a little, you know, little, -|%
you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I, -|%
it would depend upon which one you want.|sd
I think now that I've had the bicycle,|sd
I would go to the stepper.|sd
But if I were you, I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while.|sd
Because you can buy a month's membership.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Um.|b
Because it all depends, you know, for everyone their own what they want to do.|sv
Because I jump on the bike here at home.|sd
Mine has its, see, the handle bars go up and down,|sd
Uh-hum.|b
so I can sit there and read and listen to music, like what you said,|aa
and it has no effect on me.|sd
So I mean, it's boring|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Do you want to go first?|qy
You can go first,|oo_co_cc
or I will.|oo_co_cc
Well, you go ahead.|ad
Okay.|aa
Well, I'm going to tell you what I'd have|sd
Down in the south, we have a lot of shrimp,|sd
Oh,|b
yeah.|b
And I have, uh, shrimp that is steamed in beer, that --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And then I have a cauliflower that I would cook, garlic bread, green salad, tea,|sd
and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert.|sd
Oh, it sounds fantastic.|ba
Yes.|aa
And what's really neat about it is, the shrimp is cooked in your, uh, like your rice steamer,|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, um, you place the shrimp in the, in the rice steamer,|ad
and you put a bay leaf and put some, uh, red pepper over it.|ad
Uh-huh.|b
Now, you can either use, you know, the kind that comes in the little can|ad
or you can just get some, you know, regular red peppers.|ad
Is it cayenne pepper, you mean?|qy
Cayenne?|qy
Yes.|ny
Uh-huh.|ny
Uh-huh.|b^m
And you put a little bit of that over it.|ad
Now if you use the dried kind?|ad
Yes.|b
And you put that in there,|ad
and then you pour two bottles of beer over it.|ad
And how much shrimp would you use?|qw
Two pounds.|sd
Two pounds,|b^m
okay.|bk
That's the jumbo shrimp in the shells.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up.|ad
Uh-huh.|b
And you pour the beer over the top of it,|ad
and you cover it.|ad
Uh-huh.|b
And you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil,|ad
Okay.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Then you remove it,|ad
and you put it on a platter.|ad
And then you serve it with melted butter.|ad
And, uh, I usually put garlic powder in mine.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
And they can just dip it,|sd
and they shell it as they eat it.|sd
Sure.|b
But, uh, then the mi-, uh, the cauliflower, you,|ad
Uh-huh.|b
And what you do is, you just, uh, wash it,|ad
and you core it.|ad
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
A glass dish.|qy^d
Uh-huh.|ny
Uh-huh.|b^m
But it's got to have one that has a cover on it.|sd
Okay,|b
uh-huh.|b
And you, uh, put about two tablespoons of, uh, water into this bowl, and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt.|ad
Yeah.|b
And then you just set your cauliflower in there,|ad
Uh-huh.|b
and then you cook it for seven minutes on high.|ad
And you rotate it one time.|ad
And it's, are you cooking the whole head --|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Y-,|ad
Okay.|bk
I see.|aa
And, uh, you just set it in there,|ad
and you microwave it on high for seven minutes,|ad
and you turn it one time.|ad
Uh-huh.|b
And while that's cooking, I take mayonnaise, about a cup of mayonnaise, and a teaspoon of mustard, and some garlic powder,|sd
and I mix it all together.|sd
And I shred up some just regular white cheese.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And after that's cooked, you take it out and pour this on top of it,|ad
and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that.|ad
And you cook it for another three minutes on high, you know,|ad
Uh-huh.|b
And,|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh, that sounds fantastic.|ba
It is good.|sd
But it, it looks, -|%
I mean, what you can do then, see is, like what I usually do is, I'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle,|sd
and then I put the, uh, shrimp around the outside of it,|sd
Um, um.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And then I have a green salad that I put around the outside of that.|sd
And, you know, you have all the different seasonings and stuff,|sd
and then I just fix little individual cups for them.|sd
And they have the,|sd
Sure.|b
and it makes it a real nice looking,|sd
And it's --|sv
Huh-uh,|aa
huh-uh.|aa
But it --|sv
That sounds, -|%
Yeah,|aa
real-, -|%
You look like you went to a whole bunch, -|sd
I bet it tastes good too.|qy^d
Right.|na
And, uh, usually I cut those little cherry tomatoes up,|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
and I'll lay those on top of my salad, you know, to make it look nice and things like that.|sd
Now, how many could you serve?|qw
Okay.|^h
Uh, it usually serves six.|sd
Yeah.|bk
O-, okay.|bk
I figured about that.|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh, that's good.|ba
See out here, we have so many, uh, ethnic people.|sd
We have Italians,|sd
and we have Portuguese,|sd
and we have Russians and Polish.|sd
And it depends, out here, like the type of people you're going to entertain, you know?|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So it's hard, uh,|sv
you, you just have to pick something, for the, the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time.|sv
Yeah.|b
And, uh, they're big on finger food here, too. You know, chicken wings and, uh, ribs, and that kind of stuff.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Have you ever had crawfish?|qy
Uh, no,|nn
but I have had shrimp.|sd
Oh. You ought to try some crawfish.|ad
They are good.|sd
But see, that's one good thing about living down here is, usually anybody that comes over, you know, even if it's like, out of town guests and stuff, they want our cooking.|sv
Oh, of course.|ba
You know,|sv
That's, -|%
Yeah.|b
Because, just like now, especially crawfish, it is starting to move out, you know,|sv
and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is.|sv
Really?|bh
But, -|%
Is it like shrimp?|qy
Uh, it's similar.|na
Uh-huh.|ny
It's similar.|b^m
Yeah.|ny
It's not --|sd
Ch-, -|%
I mean, it's got a taste of its own, you know,|sd
but it is,|sd
Oh, it does?|bh
Does,|qy
Um, it looks more like a crab.|ng
Oh, it looks more like a crab.|bk
Uh-huh.|ny
Oh.|bk
But, -|%
Are they thin, long --|qy
No.|nn
Um, let me think of, I can't even think of what you, -|^h
I guess if, it, uh, it looks like, more like a cross between, uh, a crab and, uh, and a lobster.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Because it's small like that|sd
and it's got the pinchers like a crab.|sd
But,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
Yep.|b
And we call them mud bugs|sd
Oh|b
But, I mean, they're fantastic tasting.|sd
They are so good.|sd
Everybody, -|%

Oh! We have a few places up here that do that.|sd
Yeah.|b
And if ever I see it on the menu, I always get it.|sd
Yes.|b
It is so good|sv
You know,|b
Now how do they do the blackened?|qw
You buy it, you buy it as a seasoning.|ad
But, uh, do you have to have a certain skillet,|qy
Huh-uh.|b
Huh-uh.|nn
No?|bh
I cook mine, well, do you have a, uh, like a black iron skillet?|qy

You now, -|%

I use, uh, uh, the black iron skillet to cook mine.|sd
Do-, does it have to get extremely hot?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Yeah.|b
But it really, it's not, it, it, it doesn't burn or anything like that.|sd
The blackening is really the seasoning.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, there is,|sd
Oh, oh,|b
Yeah.|b
You know, I mean, that is a seasoning.|sd
That's really, it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time, or something like that, to get it,|sd
Oh, I see.|b
Because, it's called, uh, what it's called is, Blackening Magic.|sd
And it, it comes in a bottle,|sd
and, uh,|^h
Oh.|b
It's got a, a picture of Dom De Luise on it.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Uh-huh.|ny
Oh.|bk
Now would, you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would, prepare it any other time?|qy

Is that what you're saying?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Oh, uh-huh.|b^m
Because,|sd
But, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
And, oh, that is so good. Delicious.|sv
Yeah.|aa
But you do have to have it, you know, you do have to have it hot when you cook it. I mean,|ad
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
It does have to be really hot, you know, when you put it in.|sd
But it's not like it's burned,|sd
and it, what it, what blackens it, is the seasoning.|sd
Oh.|b
And it is so good.|sv
Oh!|ba
It is.|aa
I, I love it.|sd
Yeah.|b
I, I, in fact I was in Texas for a little while.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I liked, uh, the barbecues and the Mexican food.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I have a passion for all that type of different tastes.|sd
Because I have been brought up mostly Italian American food.|sd
Because my, uh, parents are Italian and Portuguese.|sd
So we cook a lot of pasta, and, uh, gravies, and pizzas, and, you know, roasts, and that kind of thing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's why I enjoy going to restaurants and have, you know, trying different things.|sd
Well, have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana, you know, to visit?|qy
I would love to.|no
Yeah.|b
You ought,|ad
I, -|%
Um, you don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans, you know, if you want to really get some good food.|sv
Really?|bh
I mean, you don't have to go that far south.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, of course, the further south you go, the better the food is, as far as I'm concerned.|sv
Is that right?|bh
And fact is, we're going to take a vacation this year.|sd
We're going to go to New Orleans, again.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, we're only going down there for the food, though|sd
Now, wher-, where do you go when you go there? Uh, right on Basin Street and those places?|qy
Uh, yeah.|ny
We go to the, the French Quarters and stuff like that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I have some friends that live down there.|sd
And so, usually we go to, we don't go to the tourist ones.|sd
Oh.|b
We go to the ones that they tell us to go to, you know.|sd
Oh, I see.|b
And we went to this one,|sd
it was called The Back Porch.|sd
And, uh, they were cooking the stuff, you know, while we were, we went on this boat ride.|sd
And then we came back and ate, out on this, it was like a back porch|sd
And, uh,|%
Oh, that's nice.|ba
in Of course now, when you go down there, you know, I mean, they've got just, -|sd

I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid,|sd

I may still be,|sd
um, we, -|%

That , um, -|%
I wonder sometimes|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, but we, um, we house sat for a, um, my, um, my wife's boss a couple weeks ago|sd
and, um, uh, he has a dog and everything,|sd
we were, you know, we were sitting the dog and everything|sd
and, uh, I felt like just miserable all weekend|sd
and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday,|sd
it was like, hey, maybe you're still allergic to the dog.|sd
It was like, oh, that could be it.|sd
The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek,|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, dogs are real high maintenances,|sv
you got to take them for walks|sv
and you've got to pay a lot, you know,|sv
you need to pay attention to cats and everything|sv
but it's not quite the same thing.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
Um, and, um, um, you know, it's, it's just nice that cats, you know, cats, yeah, you don't have to let them outside, you know,|sv
all cats are indoor cats,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
so, you know, they're not, yo-, w-, you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood|sv
and, you know, they, you know, they, they make their mess in the cat pan which is, -|sv
Limited.|^2
yeah,|aa
it's, you know, it's a pain to clean|sv
but, you know, we used to, -|%
I mean, they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans .|sv
They didn't, -|%
Oh, really?|bh
Well, when I was, you know, when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time,|sd
and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs and, you know, and use this thing to, you know, scoop the, take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything|sd
it was really terrible.|sd
But now they have like this, you get these liners,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and you, and you, you know the, -|%
Oh, that sounds so easy, what I did,|ba
Yeah,|aa
the cats do it in there,|sd
you pull it and take it out and throw it away,|sd
and that's it,|sd
Yeah,|b
I housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and what we used to do was just put, um, newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter|sd
and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing.|sd
Same idea|sv
Then I would do it, you know, everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very, very rarely,|sd
Everyday?|qy
and so it wasn't so bad.|sd
Oh, okay,|b
I see.|b
two cats and just as easy -|%
it just never started smelling,|sd
I would put just a little bit of cat litter in there,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
all of her animals that she ever had were adopted.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I that true,|aa
yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
she's even got, she's got one dog now and the two cats|sd
and her dog there is, is basically a reject,|sd
somebody had bought him,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It was her ex boyfriend and, you know, just was not mature enough to keep the dog, didn't realize how much work it was|sd
and now,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals|sd
but I think that for me, well, my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat|sd
because that's all there is to it.|sd
So, you know, -|%
So, you don't have anything right now?|qy
No,|nn
we don't have anything right now.|sd
Oh, except the kid,|qy^d
huh, that's , -|%
Oh, right,|na
now we have a kid|sd
but he was, no, completely against having a dog or cat,|sd
he said, they're much, they're as much work as a kid,|sd
and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend,|^q
And, -|%
Uh, I don't, I don't know because the cats pretty much, um, -|sv
yeah,|%
we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, um, uh, it's not a big deal really,|sd
I mean they're, they're happier when we're around|sd
but, you know, they, they're pretty much okay by themselves,|sd
um, and I don't, you know, we couldn't do that with a dog.|sv
That's, uh, yeah, really true.|aa
But like the friends, other friends of mine have cats,|sd
they have four of them,|sd
and if they go away, they have, they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that|sd
and their cats, you know, they're so used to the attention, that if they don't get it, they get really upset,|sd
Well , that's,|sv
and, you know, they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that.|sd
I, I tried to have, um, figured something having, -|sd

I, sort of weird for me to have had one too|sd
but there, -|%
it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage|sd
and, you know, it was easy.|sd
Yeah.|b
and but, -|%
Yeah,|aa
I, I, I have friends with hamsters and gerbils|sd
and they, they tell me the same thing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I just, -|%
again it gets into vivant much fun, you know what, I guess they can be.|sv
I, -|%
Actually it was more fun than you would think. Yeah, starting from the beginning|sv
but, um, -|%
yeah,|%
we live, also live in the city now, actually in Manhattan.|sd
Okay.|b
And so it's almost impossible to, -|sd
it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here,|sv
Right.|b
I mean, people do,|sd
Oh people, -|%
but it's not, -|%
I don't, oh,|sd
plus, I mean, the pooper scooper one New York, -|sv
so, you know . -|%
Oh, yeah,|aa
you see all these people, yeah, these stately people, and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them,|sd
it's really kind of funny.|sd
Yeah, uh ,|b
I was living in northern Jersey when that law came through, remember hearing all about it,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
we were wondering if they, uh, they had any special law for the horses in Central Park.|qy^d
Right,|^h
no,|nn
they don't.|sd
I should make you , -|%
Of course, not.|aa
they have, um, the bags behind them|sd
but I think they're actually supposed to,|sv
Hit the bags.|b
but, oh, gosh, I can't even walk by Central Park yeah when summertime,|sd
just the smell is so bad|sd
Oh, God, I can't,|sd
last time I was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad|sd
Oh, well, it's not that long ago.|sv
It was ,|sd
Not this past fall|ar
but I mean fall,|sd
I mean, it w-, it was in the, yeah, it was almost like October of eighty-five,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think was the last time I was up, up there and at Center Park.|sd
Yeah.|b
Um, I had a friend who went to Colombia|sd
and I used to go up and visit her.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, so, -|%
Yeah,|b
that's not too far from were we live,|sd
do you have, you said you had two cats,|sd
are they, um, just what you call it, are they breed cats or anything|qy
or are they just, -|%
No,|nn
they're just mutts,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
yeah,|b
my wife got them from, uh, um, friend of hers at work and everything, you know, you know, as kittens,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it was before, I mean, this was before we even met.|sd
Um, she's had them for a couple years.|sd
And um, you know, they're really cute,|sd
they're, they're sisters,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
one of them is a lot bigger than the other one|sd
and, she pushes the other one away from the food.|sd
Apparently w-, I don't know all the details|sd
but they were born around Christmas because one of them is named Tinsel|sd
and the other one is named Holly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, the scr-, -|%
They're both females?|qy
both, yeah, both females,|na
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and they're, they're both declawed at least on the, the front claws.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
the topic was, should the United States adopt the metric system, and if so, should, uh. -|sd
How should they do it?|qw
Why didn't it work last time?|qw
And why didn't it work last time?|b^m
Well, I'm all for it.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, I, I am too.|sd
I wish, uh, it had started a long time ago, is the problem, because we're so wound up in the --|sv
Yeah.|b
and I guess, what'd they try, they tried what'd the call it, soft conversion and hard conversion -- -|sd
Yeah,|aa
they tried the, -|%
-- one of them is where you just take whatever's already standard|sd
and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
direct conversion.|sd
I, I don't know. Uh.|h
I think they just ought to, you know, start, uh, just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever, you know, start your packaging, go to liters instead of quarts,|sv
and you know, people if they have to are going to learn to think that way.|sv
Well don't most of them, doesn't just about everything now have both metric and English.|qy^d
They do,|na
but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages, you know.|sv
You buy a quart of milk,|sv
and sure it has, has the metric equivalent written on there,|sv
but it still a quart.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
But if they started putting it in liters, liter of oil, and you know, liters of gasoline, people are going to learn to think in metric.|sv
As long as you can still buy a product in the English units, that's how you're going to think of it.|sv
I kind of remember back when gas prices started up, you know, pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range,|sd
somebody had, uh,|sd
I believe it was Exxon --|sd
It figures.|ba
-- we were living in Lubbock at the time,|sd
they started marketing it in liters,|sd
and it was only like twenty-nine and thirty cents a liter.|sd
So they could put this sign out front that said, you know, thirty-nine cents a liter.|sd
Right.|b
And nobody had any idea what a liter was,|sd
so, uh. -|%
That, that's the problem.|ba
When we finally out that liters was about a quart, there's about four liters in a gallon|sd
so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it.|sv
Right.|aa
It's kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age, -|sd
I don't know,|h
when I was growing up, we were talking metric system in school.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but by the time I was in fifth or sixth grade anyway.|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh.|b
I would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age, you know, under the age of thirty or so, to have some idea what it is, anyway.|sv
A liter's about a quart.|sd
The, uh, I think maybe there's where the problem came in, you know.|sv
We've tried to, instead of learning,|sv
it's kind of like learning a language, you know,|sv
when you learn one from the other, you always end up in this conversion thing all the time.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, you, -|%
it's almost like, uh, -|%
course this country isn't a dictatorship,|sv
but, you know, it's like somebody said, okay as of such and such a date, you know, anybody caught talking in the English, you know,|sv
But, uh, -|%
Well, thing is, it's a global, global market place these days,|sv
and, you know, we're like, what, one of two backwards countries in the world, as far as, -|sv
Yeah,|aa
I read that, what Uganda and, -|sd
Something.|^2
I don't remember what the other one is|sd
but, -|%
There's one or two others that just, -|%
It's just time I think for, for us to go over.|sv
Because all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international -|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I don't, you know, -|h
I work for T I,|sd
we're all around the world,|sd
you have to --|sv
Yeah, uh, I,|sd
And. -|%
And one of the things that we've run into a problem, -|%
course you're familiar with the T I drawing, well, with any drawing system --|qy^d
Right.|na
Mils and microns.|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
And then you end up with a decimal, where you start getting into mils, and that sort of thing.|sd
Right.|b
And then some of them are done in, you know, purely metric.|sd
Yeah,|b
I remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns|sd
and ours were in mils.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it got to, you know, -|sd
somewhere down the line they went standardized,|sd
they went microns,|sd
but, uh, you just, you know, you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Oh, I can imagine.|ba
So. -|%
The, uh, the one that, uh, uh, -|%
have you ever lived in a country where they use metric.|qy
No.|nn
I was with T I in El Salvador for a while,|sd
and I had to get used to, you know, purely metric system down there, because they didn't understand anything else.|sd
You know, if you start talking about miles, they'd look at you like, what.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, I had a little bit of experience with it,|sd
and also I noticed in Canada they, uh, you drop a quarter, fifty cents, whatever, in a coke machine up there,|sd
and you get this funny looking coke, you know,|sd
it's in a can that's that's taller but not as big around.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, I guess that's some -- -|%
About half a liter.|qy^d
-- it's not a liter,|aa
it's like a half a liter or something like that.|aa
It's a strange looking can.|sd
But my daughter in law's from Panama,|sd
and she has, they have had Americans down there for so long, you know, that they're kind of into both systems,|sv
but, uh, she gets real confused on distances|sd
and temperature is the big thing --|sd
Yeah.|b
I would have more problem --|sd
Well, I had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature, you know,|sd
if it's between zero and ten, it's cold,|sv
and if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad,|sv
if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm,|sv
It's getting warm, right.|aa
if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out.|sv
So, but, uh. The big problem is not having the, uh, the resolution between temperature, you know, between a hundred, if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what, thirty, zero, you know thirty four degrees, whatever that is.|sv
You know, you don't get all the little differences --|sv
Yeah,|aa
it's about. -|%
-- you know, the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees isn't much,|sd
but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is, quite a bit.|sd
Is about twice as much, what it works out to.|sd
Yeah,|aa
five|sd
One point eight times as many --|sd
Yeah,|aa
something like that.|aa
Yeah,|%
so. I, I think as long as people have a choice, they're going to stick with the American way.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And until we have to, have to learn to think that way, we won't.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Though we call it the English system,|sd
but I'm not sure what they do in England now.|sd
They're, they're on metric, aren't they?|qy
Yeah,|ny
for the most part, I think so.|sd
Yeah,|b
except they've got a, -|%
now, okay, we run into some problems once,|sd
I remember, they've got a nut and bolts system called Wentworth.|sd
And this thing was, was even different than, you know, S A E standards and stuff.|sd
So, -|%
Right.|b
This, this, ca-, -|%
okay,|%
my dad bought one of these little Nash Metropolitans here a few years ba-, quite a few years back,|sd
and the thing had a Austin Heeley type engine, you know,|sd
it was Austin motors engine and running gear.|sd
Right.|b
And the body was built by Nash,|sd
or who, you know, -|%
Ameri-, that was even before American Motors,|sd
but Nash, essentially, in the U S somewhere. -|sd
And that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth and, uh, S A E.|sd
He ended up with about three sets of tools --|sd
He just get one more .|%
Because I think the Wentworth and the S A E bolt sizes were the same,|sd
but the threads were different,|sd
and, uh --|sd
Oh, that would be a mess.|ba
And on my Chevy van that's a couple of years old.|sd
Part of it's built in Canada.|sd
Matter of fact, the thing is, I always say it's built off shore, you know, because it was assembled in Canada.|sd
The only thing that was in it was built in the U S was the, uh, differential,|sd
and it was built in Buffalo, New York.|sd
But it's got the hardest combination of, uh, metric|sd
and, most of the body parts seem to be metric,|sd
and most of the engine parts seem to be S A E,|sd
so. It's just crazy.|sd
Right.|aa
It just gets bad,|sv
now, you got to, you got to have one, and not mix them up.|sv
Yeah.|b
Because you're never going to get to one, one system if you still got a, got a mix.|sv
And of course, here that, that would involve changing road signs all across the country, you know, miles per hour to kilometers per hour, and the whole nine yards.|sv
Kind of hard to do gradually.|sv
I thought maybe they would convert to, uh, metric back when they went to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit, because what is it --|sd
Yeah.|b
and you know -- -|%
Hell, you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour.|sv
-- yeah,|aa
you'd have,|sv
hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five,|sv
you'd have people going, you're right, a hundred miles an hour.|aa
Yeah.|b
And, so. I don't know,|h
I'd kind of, -|%
and the other thing, too, is, you know, between here and El Paso's, what, five hundred miles,|sd
but it's almost eight hundred kilometers, you know.|sd
That'd sure seems like a long way.|sv
Yeah,|aa
but they'd need, they'd seem to be ticking off faster, too.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I guess that's it.|aa
Every road sign you come to, is like, well I don't know it that far.|sv
Well they converted all the road signs to fifty-five miles an hour, you know,|sd
they could've converted it to metric just about as easy.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I think they, -|%
you got the problem with all your cars are still, -|sv
yeah,|%
you still got cars on the road that don't have both.|sv
Yeah.|b
At that time, anyway, that was still when things were, -|sv
the metric system was still not, -|sv
Not all that common.|^2
You know, now cars, they have both.|sv
Sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way.|sv
I know the only other place that I was ever at where they really had it mixed was, was in Panama, where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in, in miles per hour|sd
and some are in kilometers.|sd
And you got to know where you are --|sd
Yeah.|b
So where was your last vacation?|qw
Uh, actually my last vacation was in Connecticut.|sd
Uh, we went home to visit family.|sd
Before that we were in Hawaii.|sd
Oh, I, I'd, well actually I did visit Hawaii once|sd
but I never made it off of Oahu,|sd
Oh.|b
It wasn't actually.|ar
It, -|%
w-, when we were in Oah-, Oahu, uh, I couldn't wait to get off|sd
We, we took a cruise|sd
and we went to four different islands|sd
and it was a really nice,|sd
Kauai was nice and Maui was nice.|sd
We had, we had a great time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We were there for ten days.|sd
Oh that's, -|%
wow.|ba
Yeah.|%
Yeah,|b^m
yes.|b
So where have you been?|qw
Oh I've be-, I've been lots of places.|sd
My last vacation was actually in Morocco I guess|sd
we, that one would count ,|%
Morocco.|b
Really.|b
Uh, that was about a year and a half ago,|sd
and, -|%
No kidding.|ba
An-, what, what, did you just decide to go there|qy
or, -|%
Uh, well my husband is French|arp_nd
and we were living in France at the time --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we decided that I, I've never been to Africa|sd
and I needed to get that continent since I|sd
And it, it's, actually it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go|sd
and they speak French|sd
and,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go.|sd
And,|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh I'm sure it was wonderful.|sv
We had about, a little bit less than two weeks.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And as always, it don-, it seems a bit, uh, rushed.|sv
We do a lot of traveling around.|sd
We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.|sd
Was it hot?|qy
No,|nn
in fact some of the days we froze.|sd
It was, -|%
Really?|bh
well we were there in the winter.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I was born in Saudi Arabia|sd
and, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
but I was very young|sd
so I don't remember that|sd
and,|sd
At wha-, at, excuse me, at what age did you, -|qw
Oh, that's too bad|ba
because, -|%
So I don't remember|sd
but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been|sd
Uh-huh|b
and that I was when I was a baby|sd
but so,|sv
because that's, you know, that's, that area of the world I think would be great.|sv
Yeah.|b
It was a very interesting vacation.|sd
The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and you, there were some places,|sd
Yeah.|b
there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we had nothing taken because we knew|sd
and we had things in inside pockets and in, you know, in jacket underneath a coat type of thing.|sd
Really.|b
But, -|%
We, we found that in Jamaica.|sd
It was the same way,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but they, they were so destitute|sd
and I guess they, they make all their money on tourism|sd
and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want to buy different things|sd
and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,|sd
Yeah.|b
you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.|sd
The, the worst place was in Marrakech --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad|sd
and a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities|sd
and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- it doesn't matter who it is|sd
and they keep everyone else away from you.|sd
Oh really.|b
And it's worth it|sv
and it's like ten dollars a day or something|sd
and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you --|sv
Really.|b
-- and you feel stupid doing that|sv
but we did it,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we were much happier,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and you also get in to see things that you might not get into --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well that's great.|ba
Where else have you been?|qw
Uh|^h
Well you lived in France,|qy^d
Yes.|ny
so you've been all through Europe.|qy^d
No|nn
actually I haven't been all through Europe,|sd
No.|b
Really.|b
Uh, we're going to go for a conference in September|sd
and so, hopefully, we'll get to travel a little bit too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, my more exciting spots have been, -|sd
I've been to the Galapagos Islands.|sd
Really?|bh
Uh-huh,|ny
that was one of the most wonderful vacations I've ever had.|sd
Lots of wildlife huh?|qy
Yeah.|%
Yes.|ny
If you like wildlife, it's a fabulous vacation.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
If you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest|sv
But it, that was really, really fabulous|sd
and just the photos I have of it and gosh, incredible and be so close,|sd
Now when was that, when were you there?|qw
Um, August, eighty-eight.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then, actually, after there I went to um, Hawaii,|sd
a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so, I went to Hawaii and then to Australia --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Did you go on the Barrier Re-, -|qy
did you see the Great Barrier Reef and, and go snorkeling?|qy
I, I, actually I didn't go diving.|ng
Uh-huh.|b
I, I'm a diver|sd
and so,|sd
Oh diving.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, uh, -|%
no|nn
I didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef.|sd
I drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Au-, Adelaide.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.|sd
The coastline was just incredible.|sd
It's huge.|sd
Is it really?|bh
Australia.|b
Yeah.|ny
Yeah,|b^m
yeah.|b
Uh, but, -|%
Did you have shrimp?|qy
I've seen in, you know, -|%
they, they show all this wonderful seafood and, and great big prawns, you know the big shrimp|sd
and, -|%
I don't remember if I had shrimp.|no
No?|bh
Didn't have shrimp there huh|qy
I don't think so.|ng
I remember food|sd
Oh, I like that too.|sd
But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car,|sd
it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, -|%
Oh you're adventurous.|ba
You went by yourself.|qy^d
Uh-huh.|ny
Really.|b
And I was by myself in China too.|sd
Really?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Oh wow.|ba
China was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge.|sd
But, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and so I never, you know, got out by myself, or not much,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Was it very expensive?|qy
No,|nn
actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit, -|sd
no|ar
maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less,|sd
I don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare|sd
and,|sd
You're kidding!|ba
No kidding!|ba
Uh-huh.|b
because I was already in Hong Kong|sd
and, um, but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there|sd
and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu|sd
and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it.|sd
It's a little, uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai.|sd
It's just a train ride.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And that, -|%
I had two internal, one, yeah, two internal plane flights and a couple of other things.|sd
It was really, -|%
All for a thousand dollars?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Wow!|ba
That really surprises me.|sd
Around a thousand.|sd
I guess I relate it to, to Japan where things are very expensive, aren't they?|qy
Oh, Japa-, Japan's ridiculous.|na
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
And I stayed, I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels|sd
but I stayed in, -|%
they were all completely clean,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, you know, they were newly built|sd
and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
and you don't want to stay in the very, very, very exclusive,|sv
Right.|b
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Wow.|ba
Uh, but -|%
yeah,|%
that was, -|%
tha-, I highly recommend that way to go.|sd
If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman,|sd
her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston|sd
Oh really.|bh
Yeah.|ny
Uh, and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China|sd
and she just gave me this woman's name to contact|sd
and it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and then, -|%
Well I grew up out in the country and, uh, was used to having, uh, guns around the place|sd
and, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I, I think I'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, I have quite a collection myself|sd
and, you know, I'm a good hunter|sd
and I started hunting when I was twelve years old.|sd
Of course, my parents made me take hunters safety classes|sd
and,|sd
Yeah.|b
but I don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either|sd
so, -|%
Yeah.|b
Well I, I feel that its, uh, -|sv
I think the what was National Rifle Association, uh, had this bumper sticker a few years back if, uh, about if you outlaw guns,|sd
only outlaws will have guns then.|sd
I believe that.|ba
And I believe that too because the person that is wanting to,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns, uh,|sv
we can handle it|sv
but there's an element that can't.|sv
Yeah|aa
and it's, you know, it's got to the point now where even our, our police departments and our D E A agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons|sv
because everybody that's in drug trafet-, trafficking has got them.|sv
They have got them outgunned.|sv
You know. Yeah.|aa
So. -|%
There was a an article in the paper just this week where I think it's, uh, one of the gun companies, I can't remember which, was developing a ten metal, ten millimeter automatic pistol for the F B I --|sd
Um.|b
It had, held like a fifteen shot clip,|sd
Yeah|b
Yeah,|b
that would be, -|%
but you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun, uh,|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's, -|%
Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good.|sv
No|aa
it's sure not.|aa
Huh-uh.|aa
Yeah.|b
I have lived in, uh, Illinois at one time|sd
and they, they passed a, uh, it wasn't really gun control|sd
but it was, you had to register as a gun owner,|sd
you didn't have to list your guns,|sd
Yeah.|b
but you had to have this card,|sd
it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition --|sd
Um.|b
-- and that was the first, uh, -|sd
this was twenty years ago.|sd
Yeah.|b
But they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect.|sd
See in California they,|sd
Pardon?|br
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
You have to sign a, you know, -|sd
they take your name and driver's license number, hunter, hunting license number and all that good stuff,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
now rifles aren't too bad,|sv
but, you know, any kind of handgun at all,|sd
Yeah.|b
so. -|%
We lived in Tennessee for awhile|sd
and I bought a pistol there|sd
and there was a fifteen day waiting period.|sd
You had to fill out an application and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and,|sd
Gee.|ba
Gee, that's not a bad idea.|ba
No,|aa
I think that, uh, you know, a, a waiting period, uh,|sv
Yeah.|b
but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah|aa
it is.|aa
So there's, I don't,|sv
No.|b
Th-, the only way they could do it I think, would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
You know, I think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit, course, i-, -|sv
I, I feel kind of weird about that anyway,|sd
I think if somebody shoots somebody, they ought to be shot.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I'm, -|%
So. -|%
We, we're getting into capital punishment now|sv
Yeah,|aa
but, you know. -|%
But I, I agree with you there that, uh, -|aa
It would definitely be gun control|sv
Yeah.|aa
The, uh, the, again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used --|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
It's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose, legal purpose --|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
And I'm in favor of keeping the, the illegal guy from getting one in his hands|sd
but,|sv
Myself.|%
Yeah.|aa
Well and the-, they're actually a necessity in life, you know.|sv
Oh yes.|aa
They're not, you know,|ar
not everybody needs a gun|ar
but sooner or later I need one.|sd
You know, whether I'm out hunting or you know, -|sd
I'm never had to protect my life or, -|sd
Yeah.|b
well I did in the service but not, you know, not on the street|sd
so I don't really need one in the, in the aspects ,|sd
You don't have to carry one in your car or your, uh,|sv
No,|aa
huh-uh.|aa
Yeah.|%
No.|aa
So mine are, you know, I use mine for recreation,|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't,|sd
and I enjoyed my guns.|sd
Yeah.|b
I have a good time with them|sd
so, -|%
Well I know what, uh, -|%
I took my kids out and taught them out, how to shoot a gun.|sd
My wife the same thing, uh, she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have no-, not that I have an arsenal or anything,|sd
Yeah.|b
but we have several guns around the house|sd
one of these days my grandkids probably. -|sv
Probably.|aa
Yeah.|aa
But I think it's, uh, -|%
you got to have, have the pl-, -|sv
living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot|sv
but,|sv
No,|aa
huh-uh.|aa
If someone gets shot with a,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
I had to explain that to my, -|sd
I've got a six year old now|sd
and he, you know, -|%
I have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old, well|sd
they understand now.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know I've taken time to teach them|sd
and now the young boy wants to know|sd
and, you know, like I told him, you're a little bit young for a gun. Let me go out here and, you know, we would start with the B B gun deal, you know,|sd
Yeah.|b
so he started with the B B gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows|sd
and I took it away from him,|sd
I said now,|sd
but at least it was a B B gun not a twenty-two or a four ten or something|sd
so, -|%
I remember I had an old uncle up by Tulsa, Oklahoma that took me out and, uh, showed me.|sd
This was, it was not my, it was my mother's uncle,|sd
this was a gentleman in his sixties,|sd
Um.|b
and he took me out with him and, uh, single shot twenty-two,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We went squirrel hunting|sd
and,|sd
All right.|b
and, I was probably about twelve at the time,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I thought that was the neatest thing|sd
and,|sd
Yeah.|b
and he let me shoot and showed me how.|sd
All right.|b
I think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one.|sv
Right.|b
You know, I don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away,|sd
so. -|%
Oh, yeah.|b
Well that's about all I, -|sd
we agreed pretty well on this I think.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I think so.|aa
Okay.|fc
Well it's been real nice talking with you.|fc
All right,|fc
have a good one.|fc
Okay,|fc
bye.|fc
Bye-bye|fc
Do you have children?|qy
Uh, yes,|ny
yes,|ny
I have a daughter.|sd
Do you.|bh
Yeah.|ny
How old is she?|qw
She's only about, uh, uh, a little less than two years old.|sd
Uh, I guess you have not reached the stage where you need to, uh, promote a college or anything, huh.|qy^d
No.|nn
I've got one that's seven and one that's three,|sd
so, we, uh, we started saving,|sd
but that's all.|sd
Yeah|b
So, do you, is there, are you planning to, like, encourage your children to go to a particular school?|qy
Uh, no, uh, um,|nn
no particular school.|nn
Uh, I think that's really a decision th-, that, -|sv
That you are going to let them make.|qy^d
They, -|%
well, help them make in terms of, you know, what they are, they are --|arp_nd
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
You know, that, that's a big influence, I think and,|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So, uh, you know, you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Where did you go to school?|qw
Uh, University of Mississippi.|sd
Oh.|bk
Was that local or, uh, -|qy
Uh, well, it was, well, it was within the state.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But it, it was not necessarily local, it was, -|sd
Yeah.|b
But I, I mean, so what's, , -|%
What's the criterion for choosing to go there?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Uh, well, at the time, I was, uh, thinking of going pre med --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and in the state, uh, they had the best pre med uh, curriculum for the, uh, state institutions.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It was choice between there and, uh, a private college --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
At the time, we really could not afford it|sd
so --|sd
Yeah.|b
It, -|%
uh, I enjoyed it.|sd
So you, did you commute everyday then|qy
or, -|%
No.|nn
Oh, okay.|bk
No,|nn
no,|nn
it was a six hour drive.|sd
Oh, okay,|bk
when you said it was quite a, quite a way away, I did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour|sd
or, -|%
I was, uh, it was like another world.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Basically, it was a, no it was a, -|sd
did not get home that often, you know,|sd
and at that age --|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Especially, if you have not been away a lot --|sv
Yeah.|b
So, did you go there, like, straight out of high school?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Yeah.|b^m
Uh, see I did not get my degree until later on,|sd
so I just finished mine a couple of years ago.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, you know, I guess, you know, when you have to do it that way, it makes, makes your choices a lot easier|sv
but, -|%
Uh, that's true.|aa
Yeah,|aa
that, that's like, you know, when I went on to get my, my master's --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
You know, I was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else --|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
and I was trying to work.|sd
But, uh, so when you are first going to school that, you kind of have the luxury of being able to --|sv
Exactly.|aa
Yeah.|b
Wh-, which group do you work in in T I?|qw
Um, uh, the computer science center.|sd
Oh, uh, where is that at?|qw
Uh, north building.|sd
I see.|bk
How long do you work for T I?|qw
Uh, about three years.|sd
Did you work somewhere else,|qy
like sounds like you got your master's before here|bf
or, -|%
Uh, yeah,|ny
I have, uh, uh,|sd
no|ar
actually, I mean I came straight from school to here.|sd
I see.|bk
So, cause this was the first, first real job after getting my degree.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
After your master's or after your, -|qy
After my master's.|sd
I see.|bk
My undergraduate degree was not in, not in what my master's was.|sd
I see.|b
So I made a career change --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I see.|b
Well, let's see|^h
I, have not you know, -|%
there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools, you know, just like you said.|aa
Uh, depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford, different things like that,|sv
so I, I have not --|sd
Yeah.|b
or, -|%
One day I would like to, uh, you know, the, uh, -|sd
I, I like the school where I went.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, and I would not hesitate at all to, to encourage her to go there --|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
Or the school where I got my master's at, which, which was a different school.|sd
Right.|b
And, uh, I liked it almost as well.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, but, uh, you know, that, I'm not going to hold them to that --|sd
Right.|b
I, you know, think that's -- -|sv
Yeah.|b
-- If they want to, that's fine, but --|sd
Yeah.|b
Um, because you went there.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
because they, uh, allow for, uh, uh, tuition, uh, break for out of state students --|sd
Um.|b
I didn't know that.|sd
Well certain schools do it.|sd
Yeah.|b
This school does.|sd
So, uh,|%
Huh.|b
I, I was involved in some, uh, oh, alumnae recruiting, uh, here in town, uh, recently, uh, well last year|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, and it was kind of fun, because you are trying to to, trying to get people interested in your school, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they were, -|%
this was a college night at a, at a high school in Richardson.|sd
And it was, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
And there were a bunch of kids, you know, and a bunch of schools.|sd
There were a hundred schools, probably there --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
It's kind of interesting to, to, to talk up, you know, your,|sv
Yeah,|aa
your own school,|^2
And, I was surprised by the number of kids that came, came by and had heard of, you know, our school.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um.|b
Uh, you know, we, uh, -|%
situations like that, you don't realize, you know, until you start thinking about it, the kinds of advantages you school may have over others.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And so, I, I was real, real pleased with that.|sd
That worked out so well.|sd
Yeah.|b
So did you drum up any interest then|qy
I think so.|aap_am
I don't know offhand|no
but, uh, it seemed like there were quite a few --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, there,|sd
And that, -|%
and she was wanting some more information.|sd
But she was, her, her daughter was, uh, a, a, ma-, ma-, dru-, a majorette or something.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and she was she was, letting us know she, how, how good her daughter was.|sd
She had cards printed up, actually --|sd
Oh, really.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and she was, had these business cards she was passing out|sd
and it was quite a production.|sd
I think some parents go a little bit overboard.|sv
Yeah|aa
it sounds like it.|aa
Yes.|b
Well you know I think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely -|sv
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
well the topic is selecting care for the elderly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I don't have elderly parents, yet but not that far in the distant future.|sd
What about yourself?|qo
Well, my parents are both in their seventies.|sd
My, my mother and stepfather, and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies.|sd
And, my, uh, uh, father and stepmother are not in very good health.|sd
So this is something that is, -|sd
A concern of yours right now.|qy^d
Yes,|ny
it is.|sd
Are, are they living independently, right now?|qy
Yes,|ny
they are.|sd
Oh.|bk
They are.|sd
Have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that?|qy
Not for them, my, my mother and stepfather have, have, uh, set up an arrangement where they have a large home and, uh, two of my sisters and, and their families, one of them's husband and then all the children are living in this home.|ng
Its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms|sd
and, and, uh, they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen.|sd
And, and, uh, my father bought this, uh, my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care|sd
and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home.|sd
Oh, that sounds the ultimate.|ba
Unless, unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home.|sd
Well, even at that point, most care can be given at, in the home.|sv
That sound like just an excellent solution.|ba
You must feel real good about that.|qy^d
Well, I, I felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also.|arp_nd
I, uh, I read a lot|sd
and then I know people th-, then have visited nursing homes and, uh, have had great, grandparents in the nursing homes|sd
and it was not a happy situation for, for any of them.|sd
And, and, uh, we have a very active nursing home here in Plano that, that has, uh, activities going all the time|sd
and they have, uh, -|%
even the people that are wheelchair bound and, and really are, are ti-, ti-, incapacitated.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here|sd
Right.|b
You know, th-, so there are a lot of, a lot of activities going on all the time|sd
and this is a nursing home,|sd
it's not a senior citizens home.|sd
So that the people are really, uh, -|sd
Really in need of a nursing home.|^2
Right.|aa
They need,|sd
Right,|b
uh-huh.|b
and, and, but it's a very expensive solution.|sv
Well, it's, you know,|aa
I think we just, you know, listen to, is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes.|sv
It's just a matter of finding,|sv
Right.|b
Right.|b
And, and then, of course, there is always the problem of being able, able to afford either of those solutions.|sv
Right.|aa
Uh-huh.|aa
And that, I think is what is scary,|sv
and I also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from. Is when people have to put people in a nursing homes|sv
and they really can not afford the best.|sv
Right.|aa
And that's right, I, well I took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation|sd
and, uh, they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had, had, uh, apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating.|sd
Oh.|b
And, uh, he had apparently had not been in the home too long, just a week or so,|sd
but when they, the family came in to see him, they had not been made aware,|sd
I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance|sd
and I overheard their conversation.|sd
And when the family walked in, his wife and daughter and son-in-law, they were not even aware of what had happened.|sd
Oh, goodness.|ba
So, I told them he strangled on some chicken|sd
and, uh, they said, the, the woman, the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or,|sd
Oh.|b
and I thought -|%
What a shame,|ba
they put him in the home so that he could be cared for --|sv
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
-- and then they could have done that well at home.|sv
And then she was upset,|sd
he had on two different shoes, one of which was not even his.|sd
He had on a pair,|sd
Oh.|b
and the wife said "these are not his slacks"|sd
and she said "I just took two pair over yesterday for him that were clean."|sd
And, -|%
You hear these stories,|sv
Right.|b
Right.|aa
Well, I, this was just something that I was,|sd
You happened, -|%
Right.|b
And, and, uh, at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in.|sd
And we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour|sd
Oh.|b
And, with just a curtain, of course, between us and, and, uh, -|sd
Right.|b
th-, they re-, revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth,|sd
and he was definitely, -|sd
just by looking at him and the way he acted, you could tell he was in need of, of nursing home care,|sd
but the family were all talking about, uh, putting him in another home.|sd
They said he will not go back --|sd
Well, good.|ba
Good,|ba
I'm glad they have a solution.|sd
I'm glad they the option. -|sd
yes.|aa
I know.|aa
I, I would hate to be in a position where that was all I could afford|sd
and there were not, there was no choice.|sd
Exactly.|aa
My, uh, my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for, oh, it must be seven, eight years,|sd
and, uh, and, uh,|sd
Oh, my.|ba
Um.|b
As the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from,|sv
Uh-huh.|aa
Uh-huh.|aa
Like this was a really neat vital woman|sd
and you get in a nursing home|sv
and the first thing that happens you have to share your, your whole living space,|sv
Right.|b
Right.|b
And oh I, I do not know what the answer is,|sd
but I do know that there are some wonderful places out there|sv
and it, I think it does, -|%
a lot of it goes down to just money.|sv
That's right.|aa
uh, if you, you know, have family that, uh, you can live with.|sv
Visits everyday.|sv
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
I, I really, -|%
I think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care, you know.|sv
You would do your research|sv
and you would go visit.|sv
Visit,|b^m
right.|aa
And, uh, hopefully, they would have, they would have it so that you could go there anytime.|sv
Right.|b
Because if you could not go there anytime, then that would make you,|sv
Suspicious.|^2
right.|aa
You know, I, I, my, I remember my, my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died|sd
and I guess there was not a name for what she had at that time,|sd
but I guess Alzheimer's would come as close as anything,|sd
she really was not aware of what she was doing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I ca-, I can remember she had several strokes|sd
and the nursing home was right next to a hospital|sd
and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days.|sd
And it was, she was, it was just like keeping something.|sd
Well, we've talked a little bit about the Plano school system.|sd
Um, I, I really have been pleased with Plano.|sd
I have a child who, uh, -|sd
my son is learning disabled,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, I thank God every day that I have the resources that we have tapped into.|sd
Now, is he the elementary school?|qy
He's in elementary school.|na
Uh-huh.|b
And he's not severely learning disabled.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, you know, he just,|sd
But he is being helped.|^2
He, he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they recently released him from,|sd
Oh, great.|ba
I really was.|sd
I, I just thought that was so neat, that they got him over that hump.|sd
And, um, he's in the Herman Method of Reading.|sd
I don't know if you're,|qy^d
No,|nn
that's something new to me.|sd
I'm, -|%
It is something new,|sd
and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters.|sd
Oh.|b
Um,|b
I think I read about that in the paper.|sd
It's wonderful.|sd
Doctor Haggard is, is heading that up.|sd
Yes,|ny
and it's wonderful.|sd
He didn't have a problem with reading.|sd
As a matter of fact, he's reading on level.|sd
The problem was his spelling.|sd
And,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
it's interesting, because I'm convinced I have the same learning disability, or had,|sd
Oh.|b
And, -|%
Right,|b
so you worked, you learned how to solve your problems on your own.|bf
That's right.|aa
And, and so it's, you know, it's not an intelligence problem.|sd
It's just a problem with learning.|sd
Has, has he had this since kindergarten,|qy
or is this something that maybe learning phonetics,|qrr
and then he just didn't learn the right way?|qy
Well, you know, it's funny.|sd
When, um, when he was in first grade, he had trouble with, with spelling,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I would say to the teacher, you know, it's amazing.|sd
He will be able to, -|sd
you'll say to him, spell cat,|sd
and, you know, he'll say C A T,|sd
and then he would go to write it,|sd
and he would write C O T.|sd
Okay.|b
And I kept saying to the teacher, something is wrong here.|sd
Something is wrong here.|^q
You're right, right.|aa
And the teacher kept saying, oh, he has a May birthday.|sd
He's just immature.|^q
Right.|b
Well, second grade it was, -|%
I will, -|%
these teachers as far as I'm concerned are absolute saints, because in second grade, it was about the second week of school, I went up there,|sd
and I, I requested a conference and,|sd
Good,|ba
good,|ba
that's great for parents to be involved.|ba
Well, I was,|sd
and I, and I went up there the second week of school|sd
and I said, you know, something is wrong,|sd
and thank God the li-, the head teacher, the team leader, was a special education major.|sd
Oh, how great.|ba
It was, it was|aa
and,|sd
So she, she was able to zero in.|qy^d
yep,|ny
Oh.|bk
she had already picked it up.|sd
And she said, you know, we, we were going to call you if you hadn't called us.|sd
We think there's a learning disability|^q
and we think he needs to be tested immediately, because, you know, once the first report card comes in, they,|sd
Huh.|b
and she said, I think we can get him real fast.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And sure enough, they tested him|sd
and, you know, he qualified for, for the help,|sd
and it's been great,|sd
and I, and I thank God I'm here, because I, I know I have a sister who has the other extreme.|sd
She has a, a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted,|sd
and because of the cutbacks in the economy --|sd
Right.|b
Oh, no.|ba
And, and to me that's the same thing.|sv
It's, it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored,|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
Right,|aa
but that's something that parents, I think, are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child.|sv
That's true.|aa
So, because,|sv
That's true.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
-- but learning disability, unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that, then it makes it real difficult --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and this is, this to me is the benefit I see in public schools --|sv
Yes.|aa
Right.|b
Right.|b
and I'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem,|sv
Exactly,|aa
and,|sv
and if they're a behavior problem, they're out.|sv
that's right.|aa
That,|%
and, and,|sv
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and, and we get it even at our level in, in, -|sv
I work a nine ten school,|sd
and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the, uh, parochial and pub-, and, uh, private schools --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, they come in|sd
and their attitude is, "I'm a bad boy," and proceed to prove it.|sd
Really,|b
really.|b
So I, I really hate that for them.|sd
I, I,|sd
Yeah.|b
but that's, -|%
Well, when comparing test scores, -|%
I know recently I was in a discussion|sd
and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools,|sd
Right.|b
and that was one of the points that I made, is that you're not comparing apples to apples.|sv
That's right.|aa
You know, you can't say, um, you know, I know Steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But on the other hand, I, I can't necessarily blame them,|sv
No.|aa
and they,|sv
That's right,|aa
they can be selective,|sv
right.|aa
And they ca-, they, -|%
that's right,|aa
they have the ability to be selective.|aa
But you can't say then, well, public schools are, are not as good.|sv
Right.|b
Perhaps they are, because they're, they're, -|sv
If you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them, and then compared them to the pri-, to the private school group, then I think you would have a more equitable --|sv
You're right.|aa
And I have a problem when they compare the kids in Japan or Germany to the kids here.|sd
In, in, in, uh, ho-, honesty, the kids in Japan are, they have to try out to even get into, to which kindergarten they're going to get into,|sd
Oh, really?|bh
and then after, uh, -|%
and if, if you only, -|%
the, in fact, they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten, which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and, and high school,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and if they don't, then af-, when they reach a certain age, they just, that's the end of their schooling.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, and, uh, they don't ever really go on.|sd
It's only their top ones that go on, like ours do.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And, and, uh, so that, that creates a problem.|sv
And,|sv
Yeah.|b
The other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education,|sd
Right,|b
well, you see that with the foreigners that come here.|sv
That's right.|aa
Um, I, I was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they, where they said that, you know, these children, they, they had to be the best,|sd
and they put off all social life, all everything,|sd
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
Well, is that good?|qh
Yes,|ny
the child is very bright,|sd
but on the other hand, I feel like my children, who are kind of middle of the road, have,|sv
Better coping skills.|^2
Yes.|aa
Sure,|b
sure,|b
I think it's real important to have friends.|sv
I think it's real important to play sports.|sv
I think it's real important to be part of a team.|sv
Right.|b
And so that's why I said, their childhood is extremely different from mine.|sd
We didn't do all that --|sd
Right.|b
We certainly didn't carpool and run the way I do. Um,|sd
Well, and you don't, you don't see the parents, uh, encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or,|sv
No.|aa
Right,|aa
right.|aa
it's strictly stick to the educational,|sv
and it's interesting to see them as they get older, uh, then that is the type of adult they are.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Um.|b
Uh, I guess my personal opinion, I, I don't mind paying taxes necessarily.|sd
I, I just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way.|sd
Right.|b
Uh, sometimes when I hear what, what they're, even what, even what the politicians are making, you know, when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that, uh, I think that's just a bit too much to be paying them, uh,|sv
and that's all tax money.|sv
When you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much, it's just billions of dollars|sv
that's, I think is just being thrown away.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
And then when you read about that they're spending all the money on, you know, these studies that have no relevance whatsoever, that kind of ticks you off, too.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, uh, somebody, somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying, it's not that we mind paying taxes, it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I, I, I tend to agree with that|sd
Yeah.|b
I'm not really into what they're doing --|sd
Yeah.|b
and I think there's just too many, too many levels of bureaucracy.|sv
I think it can be, can be managed by less, uh, less levels.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Well, I know any time there's, there's a big, uh, budget cut, you know,|sv
I work with the state,|sd
and any time there's, there is a budget cut or crunches, it's always the small guy that, that gets hurt.|sv
Right.|b
It's never the, uh, the person that's making a hundred thousand there.|sv
It's always the person that's making the least amount,|sv
and --|sd
Right.|b
I see these, these, uh, supervisors running around, uh, having meetings.|sd
I, I really don't know what they do.|sd
Right.|b
I sometimes wonder, are, are they really doing anything,|sd
or, -|%
Right,|aa
well, I think we're going to see a streamlining in the government.|sv
I just, you know, -|%
I, I don't know what kind of, uh, I don't know what, what level, or what, how long it will take for, you know, our country to start, the public in general to start saying, Hey, this is too much. We're not going to pay any more. You know, we're not going to pay for this,|sv
and you're out, you know.|^q
I think we're starting to see it a little bit now,|sv
but I think, uh, I don't know what, what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it.|sd
Because I think, I think we're just getting taxed way too much.|sv
Yeah.|b
I mean, right now we're getting taxed probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more.|sv
And that's, that's, you know, that's me not making a whole lot of money.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Well, they got so many hidden taxes, that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying, because, go to a grocery store, something like that, and you're paying a little tax here|sv
and you -- -|%
Right.|b
-- so. -|%
Gas, I don't know about you guys,|h
but there's probably at least about twenty-five to, to thirty cents of different taxes on, on our gas.|sv
Right.|b
And you don't realize,|sv
Yeah,|aa
we got a sales tax.|sd
Our sales tax is like eight percent,|sd
and I don't know what our gas tax is.|sd
I think it's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon.|sd
Yeah.|b
So. I mean, they're hitting us up,|sv
and they may not raise it, you know, federally as much one year,|sv
but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever.|sv
It's just, I mean, you can see that your money is just not going that far.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Well, I know they say like with Reagan, they say no new taxes,|sv
but they changed the, uh, deductions on you,|sv
and that just raises your taxes, you know, they just get it a different way --|sv
Right.|b
-- so, I mean, to me, it did, uh, raise my taxes.|sd
Right,|b
well, I mean, you could tell just by, just by how much money you have left over,|sv
and all of a sudden, I don't know it's just, it's eating me alive.|sd
Yeah,|b
I heard someone say that, uh, if they would just, something about with the, uh, the defense budget, all that extra money they're throwing back, if they cut back by so much percentage, it could throw back about six hundred dollars, on an average, six hundred dollars,|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I'll let you start this time.|ad
Well, how much do you like lawn and garden work?|qw
Well, uh, even though it's totally out of my, uh, my degree training, I've been working as, as, in the horticultural aspect, so --|arp_nd
Oh.|bk
Oh, for goodness sakes.|ba
What do you do?|qo
Well, I work for the state as, as a grounds keeper.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
well, that's interesting.|ba
Um, so, at this time of the year are you doing much garden work?|qy
No,|nn
mostly snow removal,|sd
but, uh, I don't know,|h
I, I guess, uh, growing up on the farm and, and that, I, I've always had a big interest, uh.|sd
Right.|b
I have a, uh, when I have an area to do, I, I always had a big garden --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well I love to work outside, really,|sd
and I enjoy flowers and stuff.|sd
I don't do a whole lot of it, um, at this exact point in my life, um, because I have two teenage boys,|sd
and so they do all the lawn --|sd
Okay.|b
but I still take care of the, you know, flower beds and things like that.|sd
I was even planning to go out and to, uh, dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here, but, you know, were planted in the ground since last spring --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me,|sd
and lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze down to about, oh, twenty-three degrees or something --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so the hibi-, --|sd
Oh, that's terrible.|ba
Twenty-three de-, -|%
And I really feel bad about it,|sd
it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty-five years that these --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
So, they're all gone at this point.|sd
Gardening in Texas is really interesting, though.|sd
I grew up in Illinois --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and, um, Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry,|sd
why, you know, everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has land-, uh, watering system.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so with that, why, our lawns do stay, um, you know, pretty nice all summer, if you water.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But in the winter, we have Bermuda grass --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack --|sd
Right,|b
yeah.|b
-- and and I just think it's ugly|sv
When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter, you know, and their grass is fairly green.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
that's one, one aspect of a lot of those grasses, they go dormant.|sv
I think the Saint Augustine and, uh, Centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there --|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
-- yeah,|b
those two.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Some people have, I think it's fescue --|sd
Yeah.|b
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer.|sd
They have to water an incredible amount.|sd
But, um, those law-, those lawns look nice during the winter,|sd
but, you know, they almost stick out like a, I guess not a sore thumb, a pretty thumb.|sd
But, you know, when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one, you know,|sd
it's sort of like, well, -|sv
Well, I know my folks live, uh, in Arizona there,|sd
and, uh, you know, they just grow rocks|sd
Right.|b
So. I know I was in, uh, Houston when I was working for a company once,|sd
and we were taking care of lawns out there,|sd
and, uh, that particular year they had just tons of rain, you know,|sd
it was raining continuously.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then, I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems.|sv
Yes,|aa
that's true.|aa
Yeah,|aa
Houston is a lot, um, a lot wetter than, than Dallas, Dallas area,|sd
that's where Plano is,|sd
and, um, and just humidity --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Are, are you, uh, able to get, uh, sometimes a double crops of, of certain things in your garden?|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh,|ny
I think people do.|sd
Yeah.|%
I don't have a vegetable garden,|sd
haven't for, I guess I never have here, actually,|sd
but, um, but, yes,|%
uh-huh,|%
we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio,|%
Well, let me see,|^h
what have you seen lately?|qw
Well, uh, CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE.|sd
FIVE?|qy
Yeah|ny
yeah.|ny
Y-, -|%
only, only five?|qy
Yeah.|ny
I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.|sd
Well, no,|ar
didn't need to.|sv
No,|aa
I found that out|sd
How about yourself?|qo
I just saw the latest one.|sd
How is it?|qw
It was fantastic.|sd
Oh, I can't wait.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's, -|%
the lines in there were just perfect.|sd
I mean, it was classic TREK.|sd
Now, does the old STAR TREK guys meet the new guys?|qy
No,|nn
huh-uh.|nn
No,|b
it's just the old guys still.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
it was just a rumor that that would happen this time.|sv
However, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time|sv
so, -|%
You know, that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere, no, it was U S A TODAY --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- that they said they weren't going to do anymore.|sd
That was it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, -|%
Yeah,|b
uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might,|sv
but it may not include the entire crew|sv
and it will be a next generation meets this generation|sv
Huh.|b
So, -|%
I'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was.|qw^d
I think it's a hundred years.|sd
Huh.|b
Somewhere in that range.|sd
Considering that Spock was on an, uh, you know, couple weeks ago --|sd
Oh, that's right.|aa
Is that right?|bh
He was --|qy
And, -|%
Uh-huh.|ny
Yeah,|ny
well, you know, he was rear admiral, whatever, you know,|sd
and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow.|sd
Vulcans age a lot better|sv
Well, yeah,|aa
he didn't look too bad, did he?|qy
No,|nn
huh-uh.|nn
Matter of fact, he looks just as about as old and the, uh, NEXT GENERATION as he does in the latest STAR TREK|sd
Imagine that.|ba
Yeah,|b
that's amazing.|ba
But, did they have some pretty good special effects?|qy
Oh, excellent, excellent special effects.|na
But I think the script was, you know, just incredible compared to the last one.|sv
Yeah,|aa
FIVE was, the script was bad, bad, bad|sv
Well, you know why?|qh
No,|nn
I don't.|sd
Why?|qw
Uh, William Shatner wrote it.|sd
Oh, is that right?|bh
And even worse, he directed it.|sd
Uh,|b
L-, Leonard, s-, Nimoy, he does a lot better.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
he, in fact, uh, he didn't direct this one.|sd
He produced this one|sd
But he directed the one before, uh, I think STAR TREK FOUR, something like that.|sd
IN SEARCH OF SPOCK, or, no, JOURNEY HOME, I think that was.|sd
Yeah,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
Are, you're a real life Trekkie?|qy
L-, -|%
I think so|na
I really like them.|sd
I, I wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie,|sd
but -- -|%
Uh-huh.|b
-- uh,|b
Well, I've gone to, you know, one for real live Trek Convention|sd
but, -|%
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah,|ny
I saw James Doohan, you know, the guy that plays, uh, Scotty.|sd
Huh, did you get to talk to him?|qy
No|nn
It was --|sd
Not in a crowd like that.|qy^d
Huh-uh.|b
No.|nn
It was like, uh, want an autograph, want to stand in line for about four hours.|sd
Yeah.|b
Wow.|ba
It was a pretty crowded place.|sd
Huh. They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
yeah,|b
I, -|%
it's, it's kind of funny.|sd
I, uh, was reading in, uh, a book. Uh, trying to think, -|sd
I can't quite remember the name of the book,|sd
but it was, it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style.|sd
And they were referring to, you know, Captain Kirk,|sd
every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell.|sd
Oh.|b
And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship|sd
Right,|b
so he kind of was a cowboy type, too.|qy^d
Uh-huh|ny
Made all the decisions|qy^d
but, uh, Jean Luke does more of a, a,|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
yeah,|aa
uh, it's definitely a lot better A lot more realistic really.|sv
What other movies have you seen?|qw
Uh, saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week.|sd
Oh, how was that?|qw
It was pretty good.|sd
Uh, there were a few things different than the old series,|sd
but on the, on the whole, it was pretty similar. And, a lot of fun.|sd
Lots of little funny spots, huh.|qy
Oh, yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
Did they have Thing|qy
and, -|%
Oh, yes,|ny
in fact, Thing has a big, much bigger role than he does in the series.|sd
I mean, you know, there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day.|sd
Really?|bh
And he runs around a lot.|sd
How did, -|%
I've always wondered how he gets around.|qw^d
Uh, you know, just finger hopping.|sd
But he's in a box, right?|qy
No,|nn
no,|nn
no,|nn
in fact, it's funny.|sd
He never did, does come in out of a box, I don't think.|sd
Yeah,|%
he was just kind of walking around.|sd
Didn't he used to?|qy
Not really.|ng
He was always --|sd
Oh.|bk
Oh, that's, yeah, that's, okay.|bk
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b^m
that's what I was thinking.|sd
Well, do you do any recycling?|qy
Uh, we do here.|na
Uh, see, what do we recycle?|t1
We, they recycle, -|%
they have bins --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, uh, plastic bottles|sd
and I think that's all they have.|sd
Oh.|bk
What about you guys?|qo
Well, we, uh, -|%
there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, uh, aluminum cans.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, we've got a, we've got a couple of different things, uh, places, uh,|sd
they're like unattended aluminum can smashers|sd
And you can go up there and, and, uh, redeem,|sd
we've got one that gives you like a penny a can,|sd
so if you, -|%
Really?|bh
Yeah|ny
For smashed cans?|qy
Well, actually, you have to give, put them in there unsmashed.|arp_nd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, when you do that it, it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot.|sd
Oh, can you, can you hold on for just a minute?|ad
Sure.|aa
I'm going to try pressing one again to make sure --|sd
Okay.|b
Okay?|qy
Oh, okay,|na
well, I guess, I guess,|sd
Well, I heard it that, I heard it that time|sd
Yeah|b
Okay,|b
well, anyways, you guys only get a penny a can.|bf
Well, when you buy like, uh, canned drinks and stuff like that, do they charge you for the deposit?|qy
Uh, no,|nn
you probably get charged like a nickel --|sd
Yeah.|b
Exactly|aa
and so it's like they charge you for the deposit,|bf
so when you turn in the cans unsmashed, you're just, like, reimbursed.|bf
Oh, okay.|b
Type of thing.|bf
Okay,|b
no,|ar
they don't charge us that extra nickel.|sd
That's sort of nice, though|ba
Yeah,|aa
it, it really is.|aa
Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the, off the price, if you want to think of it that way.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So when we get like, uh, uh, a twelve pack, then that's like twelve cents back.|sd
Yeah,|b
so you guys can actually get ahead|qy^d
Yeah|ny
But, uh, they have sort of like, uh, things that you c-, you're not like reimbursed for or paid for.|sd
Like we can recycle, uh, clear glass, brown glass, green glass.|sd
Yeah.|b
everyone does newspapers.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
everybody does newspapers.|aa
But, that, that kind of stuff.|sd
Yeah.|b
But they, they said they can't be smashed or else, uh,|sd
it doesn't fit in their little containers|sd
and they're not reimbursed by the, the people who are over them or something.|sd
Well, shoot, maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed, uh, Pepsi cans and whatever --|sv
Yeah|b
Exactly,|aa
yeah,|aa
send it to this address,|sv
no|ar
But, uh, let's see,|^h
they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, uh,|sd
I, I, I tell you what, what really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e-, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it, you know what I mean, then people tend to do it. Uh,|sd
Yeah,|b
that's, -|%
In other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh --|sv
As likely to do it.|^2
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
And, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass on to the consumer, you know, it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card, you know, to get money --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
You know, if it's free, people will use it,|sv
if it costs them something, then they're not as likely to use it.|sv
Yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
You know.|b
But, uh, I know we had a problem down here with, uh, oil, people taking oil out of their cars --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
And, uh, all that, because there was, -|sd
apparently a lot of people, you know, every time they change the oil,|sd
they just dump all the res-, their old oil down there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Now they're starting to recycle that stuff.|sd
Oh, that's good.|ba
Uh, another thing I thought of, I guess, to recycle would be like clothes, because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other.|sv
And one way that we do it sort of in, in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops.|sv
Yeah.|b
And that way, you know, you don't get near enough as, as much as you bought it for,|sv
but you, you got the use out of it|sv
and what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever, anyways, you can get a little bit of money for.|sv
Yeah.|b
And so --|sd
Yeah.|b
I, we're, we're new to Iowa|sd
so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before.|sd
But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh, -|sd
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Okay,|b^m
I guess we're ready to start.|sv
Well, I guess, what part of t-, what part of the country do you live in?|qw
I'm in Dallas, Texas.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
What about yourself?|qo
Well, I'm also in Dallas.|sd
Okay.|bk
The reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had, have been out of state.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, have you always lived here in Dallas|qy
and, -|%
No,|nn
I've lived here for almost five years now.|sd
I see.|bk
And I'm a, uh, -|%
before that I was at school in Rochester, New York|sd
and I'm originally from Boston.|sd
Oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood.|qy^d
That's right,|na
but I like it.|sd
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.|qy^d
Well, I missed it at first,|arp_nd
but now I go back there|sd
and I'm a real wimp about the cold|sd
So --|sd
Yeah.|bk
It's nice.|sv
Well, that's good.|ba
I, I have lived in Texas essentially all my life.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Around in Texas|sd
and, uh, I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, I don't know,|h
I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters.|sd
I'm --|sd
I know.|aa
I live, uh, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that.|sd
Uh, tell me where that is, uh,|ad
Okay.|aa
I,|sd
Uh, you, -|%
but I don't know it by that name.|sd
This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman --|sd
Okay.|b
Sure.|b
We're just north of, uh, White Rock Lake.|sd
Oh, okay,|b
yeah,|b
I know that area.|sd
That's a nice area.|ba
Well, we have some very nice hou-, homes here in this area.|sd
Uh, my particular, -|%
I guess they want us to describe the area,|sv
so, uh --|sd
Yes,|aa
uh, the homes that were here earlier were smaller.|sd
Now they've gotten larger and larger as, as they have developed the land.|sd
And, of course, it's pretty static right now|sd
and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
How about you?|qo
Well, I am, uh, I'm, gosh, I'm barely in Dallas.|sd
I'm just north of Addison Airport --|sd
Okay.|bk
Okay.|bk
And, I guess we have a similar situation.|sv
I mean, we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy, eighty thousand --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then we've got Bent Tree right across the street|sd
so I don't --|sd
Okay.|b
but some of those are pretty big.|sv
Yes,|aa
those are over a million.|sv
Yeah|aa
So, it's, that's the strange thing about, I guess, Dallas because back where I'm from, you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all.|sd
They'd all be pretty similar to one another within a, a couple miles.|sd
So, -|%
Well, we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas.|sv
Yeah.|b
Not as bad as Houston,|sv
but, exactly what you're describing is what happens all over.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
yeah,|aa
I've noticed that.|sd
Well, now, do you live in a, a home, or --|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
or, -|%
Uh, we've got a house,|sd
let's see,|^h
we moved in about four years ago|sd
and it was, it had previously been unoccupied,|sd
but it had existed for three years.|sd
Okay.|bk
This is a whole block of homes that, uh, a builder built all of them|sd
and, I guess he, he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away,|sd
So the whole block was all foreclosed.|sd
Oh.|b
And, so, some were vacant for quite a while before they, you know, they finally sold them because there were so many.|sd
Well, your, was your house in good shape,|qy
was it damaged?|qy
Yes,|ny
no,|nn
the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open|sd
Oh, it was?|bh
But, -|%
yeah.|%
Oh.|bk
So we just, you know, we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that.|sd
I see.|b
And, uh, we're really, we haven't had any problems|sd
and, you know, we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything.|sd
But the prices are much lower here|sd
and this was definitely not a fix up special,|sd
but I'll tell you,|^h
it takes all my time|sd
Between, we put in our own sprinkler system|sd
and I just finished repainting the exterior and, you know, making drapes and buying furniture,|sd
it's just a money pit. Really is.|sv
Yes,|aa
I am --|sd
I, where I live is a house that's seventeen years old when I bought it.|sd
And we bought it from someone who was in it,|sd
but before they had it, I found out after I had been in the house, it, it had sat empty for the better part of a year.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I'm not sure what happened,|sd
but I do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for, for about four years.|sd
Oh, no.|ba
I, I, I found a lot of things,|sd
but, -|%
I say Arlington, Texas now because I talked one night to somebody in Arlington, Virginia.|sd
Oh, my,|ba
yeah.|%
Well, and Plano, Texas rather than Plano, Illinois.|sd
Oh, do they have one?|qy
Yes,|ny
they do.|sd
Oh, I didn't know that.|sd
Well, I learned something already|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, let's see,|^h
the three questions are what, uh, -|%
How much time do you spend with your children?|qw
Very little.|sd
Oh|bk
What?|br
They're grown and gone.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
well, mine is, uh, down at U T Austin at college|sd
and the other one is in high school.|sd
Huh.|b
So you do spend less time then?|qy
Yeah --|ny
C-, -|%
-- because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us.|sd
They want to be with their friends.|qy^d
How old are your kids?|qw
Are they married or what?|qy
Uh, yes,|ny
I have, uh, two married, two almo-, and then two almost married|sd
and the other two, I'm not sure.|sd
Well,|sd
Oh, boy, you have a lot of kids.|sv
Yeah,|aa
we have, between the spouse and myself we have six.|sd
Oh, well, that's kind of nice, though.|ba
You --|qy
Because I came with a split family|sd
and --|sd
Well, no,|nn
there is so much of them are gone|sd
and they're doing their own things|sd
and --|sd
Well, that's true.|aa
They have to see their other parent, I guess --|qy^d
Yeah --|ny
-- and sometimes they want to do their own thing,|sd
so --|sd
I know.|ba
And, and you know what?|qh
What?|qw
Sometimes that's okay.|sd
I know|ba
Because, -|%
That's what my mother said one time.|sd
You know, right,|b
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time --|qh
Right.|b
No,|aa
that's true,|aa
and if they force them to, you know --|sv
Yeah.|b
That becomes a drudgery|sv
Well, do they all live in the area?|qy
n-, got, of the six, we've got four around here.|na
Uh-huh,|b
oh, wow.|ba
Uh, you know, well, we're talking like north Texas.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then, one is in Vermont, uh, Montpe-, Mont-, Montpelier --|sd
Golly.|ba
and the other one is in Everett, Washington.|sd
How did they end up so far away?|qw
Well, that is, that's, the, the, my little pair.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, and, uh, -|%
Those are the youngest ones?|qy
Yeah,|ny
well, the s-, -|%
the, the, the, the fourth and fifth child of the --|sd

Vermont.|b^m
So, -|%
So they wanted to make their homes there.|bf
Yeah,|aa
that's where they've gone to make their homes.|sd
My goodness.|ba
Are they, are those two married?|qy
No.|nn
They, uh, just working up there or going to school or what?|qy
Well, uh, let's see,|^h
yeah,|ny
I guess you'd say J R is working, going to s-, trying to go to school.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I wish to God he would go back.|sd
Oh, they do.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, I certainly hope so.|sd
I mean, I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T|sd
and I'm, I'm going to U T A right now myself|sd
so --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, it's, oh, I agree it's never too late.|aa
Right.|b
And, -|%
Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students.|sv
Yeah,|aa
and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I say --|sd
Oh, my,|ba
uh-huh.|%
Yes,|aa
why not because that's a, a lot of times, well, it's, -|sv
I believe that, uh, we in that category, -|sv
and I'm not in that category quite yet --|sd
No.|aa
-- but, we are seasoned minds.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
you're really ready to learn finally.|sv
Yes,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
I mean, I don't know why I even went to college when I was seventeen.|sd
Yeah,|b
it was, -|%
It was a complete waste of money.|sv
Yeah,|aa
settle down, -|%
we know what we're wanting to, to, uh, study|sv
and, uh --|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
We, -|%
Right|aa
and, uh, -|%
And we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in --|sv
No.|aa
We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning|sv
At seven,|aa
yeah.|aa
We're past, yeah, we're past that age|sv
Yes,|aa
we're, we're smarter now.|sv
We know what we can do|sv
Yeah,|aa
right,|aa
uh, so let's see.|^h
So mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so the second question, forgot what the second question,|sd
What was it, uh,|t1
h-, what do the trends in families|qo
and do we approve what other,|qy
Well, uh, the trends in the families were to spread apart, do your own thing.|sv
That's right.|aa
But I have seen --|sd
A change?|qy
I was going to say the same thing.|sd
schools are --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and between a person's religion, uh, their, their faith in their maker --|sv
Right.|b
Right.|b
and the family -- -|%
Are going to have to solve some of the problem, huh.|qy
-- those are the two that can, that, that have the wherewithal|sv
and, of course, Judeo-Christianity, uh, and of the Jewish folks, too, believe that the family unit is the one that was given the, uh, uh, mission by the Lord --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So when another group of, of, uh, people step in, try to do it, they're, they're tromping on our territory, so to speak,|sv
so -- -|%
Oh.|b
-- I firmly believe that, uh,|sd
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
You think you're getting your money's worth?|qy
Uh, never|ng
Uh, the only thing I'm, I'm thankful of is that we don't have to pay any income tax in, in Texas.|sd
Well, that's probably the next year's agenda.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Boy, I tell you what,|^h
I sure hope they don't pass something like that.|sd
Oh, yeah.|aa
They're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around,|sv
and I, I think one way or the other, we're going to pay for the bureaucracy, I guess.|sv
Uh, it's one area that is really, I, I think hurting the economy more than anything.|sv
I think the taxes have just, every time you turn around they, they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products,|sv
and I, I, I think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now.|sv
Well, I, I tell you, um,|^h
I remember every time, it seems like, we turned around, they're adding another nickel or --|sd
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
And actually, that one, the, the, the taxes on gasoline don't, don't bug me as much as, uh, uh, what are we, eight and a quarter percent sales tax?|qw
Yep,|ny
that's right.|aa
And every time you go to buy anything now, uh, -|sv
even, you know, they, they tax food.|sv
That's the one that really kind of bothers me.|sd
Well, I think that, uh, that the problem with the sales tax, of course, is it's an unfair tax across the board, uh, as far as ability to pay, which a-, allegedly, allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards.|sv
But, uh, now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of, you know, taxes on everything they buy, and where people that make, you know, two hundred, three hundred thousand dollars a year, certainly a portion of that, they aren't going to be paying taxes on, you know.|sv
And, uh, that's the unfair equity, inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue,|sv
but I don't think it is anymore, not in Texas anyway.|sd
Oh, I got you, because people that, uh, don't make very much money wind up spending it all.|sv
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
Yeah,|b
whatever they spent it on, they have to pay tax on.|sv
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
And that's the unfairness of the thing,|sv
but, uh, I think taxes generally are unfair|sv
so -|%
Wha-, what do you think of that new luxury car tax, anything over ten thou-, or thirty thousand dollars?|qo
Well, you know, like other things, if they don't affect you, you don't worry about them too much.|arp_nd
I have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still,|sd
so it doesn't, -|%
I, I think, uh, you know, generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line, which is, uh, you know. -|sv
Oh, sure.|aa
And, uh, I guess if people got thirty, forty thousand bucks to spend on a car, uh, that's their prerogative, you know|sv
I, I, I don't have a whole of sympathy on that .|sd
You, maybe you buy that, you know,|qy^d
and I don't mean to be knocking, uh, -|sd
No,|nn
uh, no,|nn
I haven't,|sd
but it, it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax, uh, on top of it.|sv
And there's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand.|sv
Yeah,|aa
there are,|aa
there are.|aa
And the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that, I guess, you know, unless they really want it, buy something that, you know, -|sv
more, well, it, it's just like having taxes on, or exemptions for kids, you know.|sv
It's a way of increasing the population, that, that was one of the initial ideas of, you know, giving exemptions on kids, on, on federal taxes.|sv
Yeah.|b
And where you exempt things, like, uh, uh, one of the best things I heard on taxes to stimulate the economy, someone, brilliant deductor, probably Lloyd Bentsen, said that all, you know, if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes --|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
Now, I don't know if that's true or not,|sd
but if you look on all interest things, not just credit cards, but on your cars and, you know, a-, any kind of interest that you're paying, from a personal point of view, that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers.|sv
Sure.|aa
So that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go, you know, tax things that they don't, you know, to a degree, well, like booze, you know,|sv
example, they keep raising the taxes on booze,|sv
it gets to the point, you know, it makes drunks sober, you know|sv
They quit buying it.|sv
Well, what, what about the taxes on cigarettes?|qo
Well, tell me about your home.|ad
Okay.|aa
Uh, right now we're living in, -|sd
well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys.|sd
And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh,|sd
but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us.|sd
So it was enough.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half.|sd
Because it's not a full two story.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house|sd
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.|sd
Huh.|b
And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.|sd
It sounds nice.|ba
It's, uh, pretty nice.|aa
Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already|sd
Oh, yeah?|bh
Yeah.|ny
It was a, -|%
Landmark is the one who built it.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, you know, these guys that gambled high --|sv
Yeah.|b
That's true.|aa
And, uh --|sd
Exactly what happened to them.|aa
I'm building my own house.|sd
Oh, that's nice.|ba
And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today|sd
Oh, really.|bh
Yeah.|ny
Are you doing it yourself?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Wow.|ba
I used to be a builder.|sd
Oh, that's nice.|ba
And I retired about five years ago and --|sd
Oh, I see.|b
Huh.|b
And now I'm a college educated builder|sd
There's still no work, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials|sd
so I did.|sd
That's great.|ba
And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.|sd
R-, -|%
is that so?|bh
I didn't know that.|sd
You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house|sd
but you can't borrow the money to build your own.|sd
Well that sounds kind of dumb.|ba
Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then it doesn't sell|sd
and then the bank's --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Well. -|%
Huh.|b
As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?|sv
That's right|aa
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple.|sd
It's designed to be added on to.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's good.|ba
Yeah.|b
Well, I figure it's just me and my wife|sd
but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,|sd
so I want --|sd
Yeah.|b
How big a lot do you got it on?|qw
Ten acres.|sd
Wow.|ba
That's nice.|ba
That's real nice.|ba
Well, yeah.|aa
It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.|sd
He's on the other side of a hill.|sd
Oh.|b
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.|sd
Seriously.|sd
God.|ba
That's pretty good.|ba
Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy|sd
but, you know, he's -- -|%
Uh-huh.|b
-- I can just make out his place, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
And, uh, -|%
Oh, that's pretty good.|ba
Yeah.|aa
Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?|qy
Well, it's got a, a very small furnace.|arp_nd
Uh-huh.|b
And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, lo-, these many months --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I have not had to use the heat.|sd
Wow.|ba
Because it's all geothermal.|sd
Yeah.|b
That's pretty good.|ba
And with all the, -|%
see I've got, -|%
on the south side is all glass.|sd
Well, as much as I could get in it, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet.|sd
So it's almost all glass.|sd
Wow.|ba
And, uh, -|%
My wife would love that|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
I mean, you know.|sd
She loves lots of windows.|sd
That's great.|ba
So, uh, -|%
Is it a single story?|qy
Well, not really.|arp_nd
It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.|sd
Oh, I see.|bk
So the first, you know, -|%
the, the, the, -|%
what I call residential level --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I see.|bk
And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.|sd
Oh.|bk
So I've got a pretty good grade there.|sv
Yeah.|b
And then when I put the verandas whi-, which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?|qy
Exactly.|na
Yeah.|b
I, I've always liked that.|sd
The, -|%
you know, I, we don't have much yard|sd
but I built a small deck in the back.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
so you have eight children.|bf
Um, what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together.|qo
Oh, we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging, bicycling, uh, going to the park, um, some time watching V C R --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
we know how that goes.|ba
Uh, with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation.|sv
That's right.|aa
Well, that's fun.|ba
So, um, let's see, uh,|^h
some of the things we do together as a family, we like to play games a lot,|sd
and you may think this is funny,|sv
but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek,|sd
and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark --|sd
Yeah.|b
and that is so fun.|sd
The kids just get a crack out of that.|sd
Um, we like, we do like to go to the park, too you, uh, like your family.|sd
Um, we don't do a lot of vacationing.|sd
Have you taken a lot of vacations together|qy
or, -|%
Most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa.|no
Uh-huh,|b
and whe-, -|%
We get an occasional one or two day thing --|sd
Oh.|bk
-- but most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa.|sd
Oh, now where do they live?|qw
In Arizona.|sd
Oh, so that's a bit of a drive for you there.|qy^d
Yes.|ny
Oh, so you like to go there for the holidays|qy^d
and. -|%
Oh, we don't go very often for holidays.|arp_nd
Generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays --|arp_nd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, uh-huh.|b
Uh, what are the ages of your kids then?|qw
They range from twenty-four to five.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
So you have some in the nest and some out, huh.|qy
That's right.|na
How old are your children?|qw
We have, -|%
ours start at twelve|sd
and then they go down to four.|sd
I think the hardest thing for us has been, is to find ac-, you know, leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together --|sd
I bet,|ba
yeah.|%
like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but the young kids don't understand it --|sd
Yes,|b
uh-huh.|b
-- and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that,|sd
and. -|%
Yes,|b
and then if you want to play something on the little kids' level, then the older kids get real bored,|sv
and they want to do something else.|sv
So. -|%
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I can, I can relate to that.|ba
Um, do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one?|qy
I think it's improving, actually.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
We had an interesting experience the other day.|sd
We, we have pretty much a, a routine that we spend,|sd
we don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we just kind of keep them at home --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and our next door neighbor, uh, -|sd
we were at a soccer game Saturday,|sd
and our next door neighbor was there,|sd
and somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend Saturday night at their house --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and she said, no, Sunday's our family day --|sd
Uh-huh|b
-- and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them.|^q
That's good.|ba
And I think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now.|sv
Oh, good.|ba
I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now.|sv
I think so,|aa
and I feel like, you know, like President Bush, Bush has mentioned quite often, that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation,|sd
and it does begin with the families at home --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- and so I, I'm a firm believer in that, too.|sd
I think a lot of people are panicked, how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something.|sv
So. -|%
Yes,|aa
that's, that's true.|aa
Well, we see that a lot out here in Utah,|sd
and, um, hopefully, hopefully it's going to spread, huh. .|sd
Utah's a lot better than Texas.|sv
Oh.|b
Um, do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas,|qy
or. -|%
Very few.|ng
Very few.|b^m
You feel like you're in the minority?|qy
Oh, definitely.|na
When we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense.|sd
Oh, dear|ba
But, uh. -|%
Well, out here in Utah, five is about the --|sd

yeah.|%
My wife and I were in Utah until --|sd

Never been back, since then,|sd

Yeah.|b
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Martin, do you do any exercise?|qy
Yes,|ny
I do.|sd
Uh, I like to, uh, play basketball and weight lifting.|sd
Those are probably the two main things I like to do.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, so those are more or less indoor sports.|qy^d
How's the --|qw
Yeah.|ny
Um, in, in, in the winter, you, typically it's, it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis.|sd
Um, I like to play tennis in the --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but in the winter it gets pretty cold.|sd
Oh.|bk
Um, yeah,|b
so it's mostly indoor sports, I think, in the winter.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, how about yourself?|qo
Well, yeah,|^h
I'm on a exercise program.|sd
I'm riding my Aerodyne bike, um --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I'm just about ready to up it to up to forty-five minutes a morning,|sd
and I feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time.|sd
It's --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Do you do, uh, any anaerobic type, weight lifting or weight training type exercise?|qy
No,|nn
huh-uh.|nn
I, first of all I'd like to get my weight off.|sd
I'm about fifty pounds overweight,|sd
and so I'd like to get the weight off,|sd
and then I'd really like to get into that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, we have a, my husband and I have a, a, aerobic video that's called The Firm.|sd
I don't know if you've heard of it,|qy^d
but it's a, an aerobic video with, not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down,|sd
but you're using weights,|sd
and that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done.|sd
It's --|sd
Huh.|b
Yes,|b
it's, it's, it's aero-, it's similar to aerobics with weights --|sv
Yes,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
-- but it's like low impact aerobics, just --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
are you familiar with, um, step or bench aerobics?|qy
Um, no,|nn
I mean, yes,|ny
I am,|sd
but I have never done it myself.|sd
Have you done that?|qy
Uh, yes,|ny
I have.|sd
In, in Atlanta that's, um, -|%
most of the health clubs --|sv
Oh.|b
that's the, that's the in thing.|sv
That's the big thing, huh?|bh
At first it was just regular aerobics,|sv
but now bench or step aerobics have --|sv
Oh.|bk
So how is that?|qw
Um, it, they call it a low impact aerobics,|sd
and it's supposed to burn off more calories --|sd
Oh.|bk
And from when I've done it, it does give you a good, a real good workout.|sd
But only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees --|sv
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
They, they seem to think that it, it won't,|sv
but you never know.|sv
Now, if, um, playing basketball, are you knees, -|%
do you have healthy knees?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I, I think my ankles probably are my main weak point.|sd
Oh, dear|ba
But, I've, I've kind of taken care of that.|sd
I wear high tops and then also an an-, a support ankle brace which is very stiff --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, um, we-, wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so.|sd
Oh, that's good.|ba
Well that sounds, you sound just like my husband.|sd
He --|sd
Yeah.|b
and, oh, he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy.|sd
Yeah,|b
I. -|%
So that's what he does,|sd
he wears his, his brace and his high tops|sd
and, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
I did, I injured mine so many times that --|sd
Oh.|b
Oh, .|b
I mean, it would only take three or four days|sd
and I could play again on it --|sd
Wow|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, dear.|ba
Oh.|%
But, um, so how, how successful is your exercise video?|qw
It is amazing how fast you take off the inches --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I would, once I start my forty-, I'd like to do the forty-five minutes a day on the bike for a week,|sd
and then, every other day I'd like to incorporate the video, and then the bike on the other day.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, it is really amazing how fast the inches come off,|sd
and the muscle builds --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, you can start, -|%
they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month|sd
and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells, and then build up to your, uh, twenty-five pound dumbbells --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video|sd
and it's a hour long video,|sd
so. -|%
So it's a good workout.|bf
It is,|aa
yeah,|aa
I really enjoy that,|sd
so I'm looking forward to losing this weight and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, in the winter, I guess, there's a lot of, -|qy^d
it's quite cold and --|qy^d
Yes.|ny
Yes.|ny
Now this one has been quite mild.|sd
Um, we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter, because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground.|sd
It was quite chilly|sd
but not, -|%
Hello.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I pressed the button one,|sd
so we're recording right now.|sd
I'm sorry|fa
That's okay.|bd
I'm Bill from Raleigh.|sd
Okay,|b
and I'm Melanie from Harrisville, Utah.|sd
Oh, another one from a different state besides Texas.|sd
Yeah.|b
Um, okay,|b
Bill, we're talking about family reunions.|sd
Right.|b
Okay, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
have you ever had to plan a family reunion?|qy
Uh, yes|ny
and no,|nn
it wasn't really a fa-, a planning one,|sd
but it was kind of, uh, it was a birthday --|sd
Oh.|bk
-- and I brought a lot of family together then.|sd
Uh-huh.|bk
And how did you feel it went?|qo
It went pretty good.|sd
I'm, I've worked in hotels,|sd
so I, I kind of know how to do these things.|sd
Oh.|bk
I used to, you know.|sd
All this planning and, and getting together and such.|qy^d
Um, oh, let's see what else.|^h
Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday,|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
She has like seven sisters I think.|sd
Oh, boy|ba
They show up and all their kids.|sd
And then all, she has, uh, -|%
I have like, uh, -|%
let's see,|^h
she has four sons and two daughters,|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so it's a pretty big reunion,|sd
it's about two hundred people, maybe.|sd
Oh, my word.|ba
Well, what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together?|qo
Um, the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, you know, could eat comfortably and, and everything, uh.|sd
Uh-huh.|bk
I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, um, for the rent, we rented like a, a rescue squad building or something --|sd
Oh.|bk
Uh-huh.|bk
And, uh, each one of the, everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for like soft drinks|sd
and --|sd
Oh.|bk
Oh, that's good.|ba
And each person in the family, you know, brought a dish, or something.|sd
Uh-huh,|bk
and then did you have a main meal,|qy
or did everyone just bring, -|%
it was just pot luck.|qy^d
It was kind of pot luck.|na
Uh-huh.|b
You know, everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
show off a little bit|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
And of course my grandmother's food was, as always, gone first --|sd
Oh.|bk
Oh.|bk
Now how old is she?|qw
Uh, she's eighty-six.|sd
Oh, goodness.|ba
Is she pretty spry, is she, you know, pretty.|qy
Now she does, -|%
she looks probably like she's in her early sixties --|na
Oh, wow.|ba
-- and if she didn't have arthritis, she'd get around better --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|bk
Oh, that's neat, that she's in good health, and that, at that age.|ba
Yeah.|%
Oh, yeah.|b^m
My nickname for her is Honey Woman.|sd
That's what I call her.|sd
Really.|b
Well that sounds fun.|ba
Well, I I had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago,|sd
and there were, -|%
we sent out five hundred, uh, announcements, because our family is quite large, like your, your family there.|sd
And so that was a real challenge,|sd
and I was president of our family reunion for two years,|sd
and I wasn't very at that duty, for two years in a row,|sd
but I found that advance planning was the key to success.|sd
Uh, also one thing that's helpful,|sv
and I don't know if your family's spread out or whatever --|qy^d
Uh-huh.|ny
-- but most of, all my family lives like in the same county|sd
so -|%
Oh, that's wonderful, though -|ba
But it's just kind of like get on the telephone|ad
and,|^q
Oh.|b
-- and everybody just shows up.|sv
Oh, well, that is, that is helpful.|aa
Yeah,|%
our family ranges from, oh, goodness, well, Australia,|sd
I have a brother lives in Australia, to, uh, Boise, Idaho, and, and, uh, all kinds of places.|sd
I would say you're spread out, then.|sv
We are|aa
Uh, my immediate family, you know, my, my parents and my brothers and sisters, I guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever,|sd
because my dad was in the Army|sd
and we're --|sd
Oh.|b
But since they've moved back to Carolinas, we still are the only ones do not live in --|sd
In. -|%
Oh.|b
I live in Raleigh,|sd
and then my, my parents live in Greenville,|sd
and I have one brother and his wife --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So I mean, we're, we're spread out,|sd
but --|sd
Boy.|ba
so. -|%
Oh, my gosh.|ba
Nobody moves away except us|sd
They must really like it there.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
I got out as soon as I graduated.|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh.|b
Just like this town is too small for me,|sd
Good-bye.|^q
Oh, you're ready to move on to bi-, -|qy^d
How do you feel about gun control?|qo
Well, uh, I mean I don't think that guns should be outlawed --|sv
Um.|b
-- but it's going to, -|%
a lot of the stuff that, -|%
I mean all you do is to get guns --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well, don't you think that you know, just having, you know, some, you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with, with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry.|qy
Yeah,|ny
that, -|%
well do you even know what the procedures are now?|qy
Um.|b
There is no national, -|sd
But, it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun, especially if you have the money to pay for it.|sv
Uh, in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh, and I know, I know that like in a lot of states you could, you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before. You know, be, be obviously insane,|sd
and then, you, you know but have your legal right to get a gun.|sd
Huh. I didn't know that.|sd
Well, that's pretty scary.|ba
So, does, now do they want us to say where we feel about it, like in rating it one to ten.|qy
Uh, yeah,|ny
I'd probably, I'd probably say about a five.|sd
That's where I would probably be|sd
Seems like it's a good safe number to pick, you know.|sv
Well, I mean, I mean I don't really know what they can, how they can really enforce the laws any better --|sd
Uh-huh|b
-- because I mean I do think that some people need them and, like, for protection and stuff --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I can understand them wanting to have them,|sd
but then again it's just like all those nuts out there.|sv
Well, you know, uh, uh, no-,|%
if you are looking at like you know country that, uh, where they do have a lot more gun control, like England and places like that, you know|sv
the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much.|sv
It has?|bh
Because then, -|%
Well I mean yeah.|ny
The, uh, the -|%
in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States.|sv
Um.|b
Uh, you know, I mean, the problem though, you know, they, if the, since the United States had this, you know, pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think, you know, if you were introduced, you know, any controls, it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already.|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, so it's, it's really kind of a complex problem.|sv
Well, is the crime that bad there in Atlanta?|qy
Uh, I'm not really sure how bad it is.|no
I've, I've not really had that many problems with it,|sd
but I mean apparently we, we were ranked pretty high up.|sd
Yeah|b
I know Dallas is.|sd
Uh. I mean, I think, you know, in the te-, -|%
I mean I think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.|sd
I don't know if Dallas is in the top three --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but. Do you own a gun?|qy
No.|nn
I've thought about getting one.|sd
If I get one, I think I will probably, you know, get something.|sd
I probably wouldn't get a hand gun.|sd
I would probably get like a shotgun.|sd
Just for protecting myself. You know, from --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I do kind of live in the downtown area.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know and shotguns are really good because they're, -|sv
I mean somebody is not going to break in, steal it, and you know, use it to mug someone, you know.|sv
That's true.|aa
Uh, and you know, you, -|%
yeah,|%
I just don't understand these people, you know, like when they, they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves.|sd
They go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know, -|sv
they are probably going to miss the person|sv
and, and they're going to shoot through five wall,|sv
I mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon.|sv
You can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of --|sv
Yeah.|b
You pretty much stop them.|sv
And, you don't, -|%
then the actual shot doesn't go that far, you know, a wall will stop it pretty much.|sv
and, uh, my Dad gave me a gun --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but I never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so I finally ended up giving it back to him.|sd
I said I don't want it.|sd
I don't want to be responsible for it because --|^q
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
that, that really does scare me. People, you know, that have guns|sd
because you know, if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot, -|sv
but you pick up the gun and point it at the person --|sv
Yeah.|b
And they get it from you.|sv
And you know, you're pretty much dead you know.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Set them off.|^2
and, and, well I mean, you, you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he, unless, you know that you are a real danger to them|sv
and then you know if you, if they manage to get the gun from you, you know their first reaction is going to be you know, stop you.|sv
Yeah,|aa
well that's why I ended up giving it back to him.|sd
I thought well --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I just didn't want the responsibility.|sd
Um.|b
So. Well, uh, did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever?|qy
Yeah,|ny
the, did it happen at a cafeteria or something?|qy
Yeah,|ny
right.|na
That kind of --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I would be scared selling guns to people.|sd
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Uh, first, um, I need to know, uh, how do you feel about, uh, about sending, uh, an elderly, uh, family member to a nursing home?|qo
Well, of course, it's, you know, it's one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do, you know. Unless it's just, you know, really, you know, and, uh, for their, uh, you know, for their own good.|sv
Yes.|aa
Yeah.|aa
I'd be very very careful and, uh, you know, checking them out.|sd
Uh, our, -|%
had t-, place my mother in a nursing home.|sd
She had a rather massive stroke about, uh, about --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, we were, I was fortunate in that|sd
I was personally acquainted with the, uh, people who, uh, ran the nursing home in our little hometown.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, I was very comfortable, you know, in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it.|sd
But there's, -|%
well, I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be, you know, could not take care of herself anymore, was confined to a nursing home for a while|sd
that was really not a very good experience.|sd
Uh, it had to be done in a hurry.|sd
I mean, we didn't have, you know, like six months to check all of these places out.|sd
And it was really not, not very good, uh, deal.|sd
Yeah.|b
We were not really happy with,|sd
Yeah.|b
Fortunately, she only had to stay in a few weeks|sd
and she was able to, to return to her apartment again.|sd
But it's really a big, uh, big, uh,|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, is there something else we could have done, you know, in checking out all the places that, uh, might be available.|qh
Of course, you know, there's not one on every corner,|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|aa
Yeah.|aa
Probably the hardest thing in, in my family, uh, my grandmother, she had to be put in a nursing home|sd
and, um, she had used the walker for, for quite some time, probably about six to nine months.|sd
And, um, she had a fall|sd
and, uh, finally, uh, she had Parkinson's disease,|sd
Oh.|b
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house.|sd
Right.|b
Then she lived in an apartment|sd
and, uh, that was even harder --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Because it was, you know, it was just a change of, change of location|sd
and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling.|sd
Yes.|b
I mean, she tr-, she had, she had children all across the United States --|sd
Uh-huh|b
-- and, you know, she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children.|sd
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, um, that was pretty heart-rending for her.|sd
I can imagine.|ba
I think when she finally came to the realization that, you know, no, I cannot, I cannot take care of myself.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's tough.|ba
That's tough.|ba
Yeah.|aa
I mean, for somebody who is, you know, for most of their life has, has, uh, not just merely had a farm but had ten children --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, you know, facing that situation, it's, it's quite a dilemma.|sv
Yes.|aa
I think, -|%
my mother, excuse me. -|fa
Go ahead.|ad
Yeah.|aa
Well, my, uh, my, uh, -|%
probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think that they, they had a great deal of, um, -|sd
all the brothers and sisters got together|sd
and they actually had a conference.|sd
That's great.|ba
And, I mean, it was just, it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family, getting down together and doing that.|sd
That's right.|aa
And, and just the children were involved in the decision, because it involved just them.|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
and everybody had duties --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, whether it was just, you know, giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yep.|b
You were very,|sv
And they, -|%
I know.|aa
They, and, well, they had, well, they had, they had seen it coming.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, so, -|%
I mean, it, -|%
I mean, I, I, I, I har-, I, I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|aa
Absolutely.|aa
Unfortunately, a lot of times it, responsibilities like that seem to fall to, you know, maybe one child in the whole family, you know.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|aa
Well, we, we, -|%
And, uh, it's usually not a very smooth,|sv
Yeah.|b
We were, I was lucky too that I only have one brother.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, fortunately, we agreed, you know, on exactly, you know, what we thought should be done.|sd
My mother also was very very independent.|sd
She had her own, still had her own little house and still driving her own car,|sd
Yeah.|b
We were lucky in, that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really, you know, really much aware of what was going on.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That nursing home life would not have been, you know, anything of her choosing,|sd
of course, she would, she would not have been happy there at all.|sd
Um.|b
But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Well, with my, with my grandmother I think it was, it was such that, uh, that she did not have the problem with, -|sd
she was very well aware|sd
and her daughter came and visited her --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- at least her daughter,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
That's great.|ba
And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest, -|sv
um, I, I, I think it would be, -|sv
it was more of a relief --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Sure.|aa
And, um, -|%
I mean, but she was truly, she was truly aware.|sd
I mean, I, I, I di-, I don't know how I would, how I would deal if one of my parents came with, with Alzheimer's.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That would be tough.|sv
Yes.|aa
Absolutely.|aa
And, um, I, I, I think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily, you know, like the quantity of care --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
That the people that worked there --|sd
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
It would, -|%
I think, I think, I think, you know for myself I, I see that as probably the, the, what everything would hinge upon.|sd
Oh,|b
Is it, -|%
how close is it to a home environment.|qh
Yes.|aa
That's right.|aa
That's the, that's probably the major question.|sv
I think that great strides are being made nowadays in, in caring for the elderly, you know, in several, in a,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Just people are, of course, populations getting older.|sv
Yeah.|aa
You know it's, it's interesting that, that a lot, the population of the United States is changing because, you know, uh, now that so many more minorities, where they have had extended families for such a long time.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Um, matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
It wasn't,|%
true.|aa
But, I guess as we become more industrialized and more, you know, less in a rural situation --|sv
Yes, um.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
That's right.|aa
Sure.|aa
Absolutely.|aa
And,|sv
Yeah.|aa
I, I, I think that perhaps, perhaps the extended family, you know, that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care.|sv
Yes.|b
You know I mean, of course there, there comes other issues, you know, whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like are going to be a good, they're going to be a good caretaker for our children.|sv
Yes,|b
But, -|%
just because they're grandparents.|sv
I mean they raised us after all.|sd
Yeah.|aa
Just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer.|sv
Yeah.|aa
But, uh, I, I, I think that, you know, we always, uh, I mean, I've, I've had a lot of good experiences with, uh, with many many people especially where they've had, uh, extended family.|sd
And I, and I, I kind of see that, that, you know, perhaps, you know, we may need to like get close to the family environment and --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, uh, it's, -|%
money seems to be too big of an issue.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
sure.|aa
realistically it is.|aa
and I, I think, I think that we may not, that may be, you know, perhaps if we put money on the back burner --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That would,|aa
I mean,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- but the qua-, but actually have a truer standard of living.|sv
Right.|aa
That's just a matter of defining priorities, I guess --|sv
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|b
I think your right.|aa
Okay.|b
Well, I guess that was it|fc
Okay.|fc
It was good talking to you.|fc
Okay.|fc
Yeah.|fc
All right.|fc
Take care.|fc
Hey.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Well, the first thing for me is I wonder, I see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is, um, if privacy is something that disturbs your private state, I mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state,|sv
that's one thing,|sv
and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it, in other words, finds something out about you that's another.|sv
And the first kind of invasion of, the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me, and very much everyday in this country,|sv
but in the second time, at least overtly, uh, where someone comes in and, uh, finds out information about you that should be private, uh, does not seem, uh, um, obviously, everyday.|sv
I, I think I agree with that.|aa
I think in a good example on the typical thing that happens, uh, when the phone rang|sv
and it's T I calling,|sd
my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message|sd
and then I realize, oh, no, this is something I solicited,|sd
That's right|aa
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion|sd
but after that I realized, no, I, I really wanted this|sd
and it was sort of exciting|sd
and so,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right,|aa
it turned out to be, uh, uh, an invitation.|bf
Exactly.|aa
Uh, and at the same time I think that I receive on, on the order of, uh, probably, seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it.|sd
From, from personal parties or from these, um, phone answer, phone, uh,|qy
Commercial,|sd
Oh, that, that's a remarkable number.|ba
I get them rarely|sd
and I'm still astounded that, that one, they let anyone do them and two, that they have any effect in this whatsoever|sd
Um, because I'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what,|sd
Yeah.|b
I think they prey on people's, um, inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine.|sv
I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say,|sv
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there.|sv
And I think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control|sv
and you, one's feeling obligated,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|aa
Uh-huh.|aa
And, and, uh, that, that then ends up being the, the most common example for me.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second, this one that you raised.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I don't think I would have thought about that.|sd
I think that's a good idea on your part.|sv
I don't typically feel intruded on, on the things, uh, the sense of finding out information.|sd
Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known,|sd
and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I A conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge.|sv
So there's, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it,|sv
and I can't talk about the second one other than to, to, to generate paranoia|sv
It's a surmise|sv
and,|sv
To, to surmise. It is there.|sv
I don't think I'd like the K G B is monitoring my phone or anything like that.|sd
Well, I guess, although, I, well, that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
and I'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
Uh,|sv
uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
but I don't feel invaded by it.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
I don't,|sd
uh-huh.|b
I'm not sure why.|sd
Uh, I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts|sv
and if someone finds out something about me that is true, I, I don't have a sense of loss from that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, you must have a relatively clean conscience then|qy^d
Um, the, the other side of that might be if, if someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense.|sd
Yes,|aa
yes,|aa
ev-, more harmed or something.|sv
Bec-, -|%
right,|aa
because,|sv
Yeah.|b
Tho-, -|%
did you hear about this Lotus data base that was being put together?|qy
Yes,|ny
I did.|sd
I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled it.|sd
That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I would find that there be, cou-, a good possibly that their facts were, were fantasy.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from a, that I would rather they didn't|sd
and that might be the sense of the spending pattern, for instance,|sd
Uh-huh, uh-huh.|b
But then if it turns out to generate incorrect things, that's even worse|sv
so,|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
They had you pegged|^2
Right.|aa
And the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money -|sv
and then all of,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Right.|aa
Exactly.|aa
Yeah.|b
And, um, one of the problems with the Lotus data base was, um, that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information.|sd
I mean, they said they would give it out to only select companies|sd
but, um, you know, just like software is only given out to customers,|sd
I mean, you can't believe that.|sv
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
It would, it would be pirated|sv
and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering, you know, full cash price,|sv
Right.|b
I mean, you know, you can't tell it, what a company really has to do with it|sv
and there's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone, any hacker being able to know what your income is, what your spending habits are,|sv
and, you know, and, and that hacker just has to get in to, in touch with the sneak thief|sv
and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home.|sv
Uh-huh.|aa
And I guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling,|sv
Yeah.|b
so,|sv
Yes.|aa
Exactly.|aa
Uh-huh.|aa
I also thought about it, was of, uh, waiting to talk to you that, another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how to behave such that there isn't.|sd
But I realized I have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy.|sv
If I deviate from social norms of behavior, if I run up and down the street yelling or something, someone's going to invade my privacy very quickly.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And I realize that that, I mean, I can take that for granted|sd
but I used to, I used to live in India|sd
and things are quite different there in terms of that.|sd
There's less of a sense of privacy.|sd
In fact, it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy,|sd
certainly the language I know doesn't,|sd
Oh, that's interesting.|ba
Loneliness is the closest you can come, which is really quite different.|sd
But, but no concept for wanting to be private.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's, it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state, at least officially.|sv
Okay.|b
Um, so there's not, -|%
I mean, doors don't have latches on them.|sd
People don't tend to knock,|sd
you just, -|%
if there's a door closed and you open it because it's in your way|sd
you, people walk in out|sd
and, as a, as a westerner in India, and I was often surprised,|sd
Oh.|b
That, that would be,|sv
You know, it very much is.|aa
But on the other hand, I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and people would leave,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much, if you go out and then act like the lunatic you, you violate the, uh, the norms of social, of, um, public behavior.|sv
Um, people start paying attention to you very much|sv
and they start asking questions and in the sense are invite-, invade, invading your privacy although, if you know what the social norms are, you know, quote unquote, you asked for it.|sv
But it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms.|sv
Yes.|b
And which isn't of, always the case in all cultures,|sv
and it wasn't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that's actually something that's culturally relative.|sd
Tha-, that is true.|aa
I haven't thought about that|sd
and, and that it's fascinating to, to think a lot of someone who doesn't know how to say private.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
And that's really, um, -|%
well, I mean, I, I wonder how people have sex,|sd
I mean, they a-, -|%
you go to India|sd
and it's obvious, you know, the results of sex are quite obvious, as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years.|sd
Um, but I, I just don't quite, um, -|%
there's hope, I actually for al-, -|%
of the time I've spent there, I still don't quite understand how certain things that I assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy.|sd
Yes.|b
Because anyone can be alone for some period of time|sd
but for me a lot of what I do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people wil-,|sd
Yes.|b
And if that's gone, um, I, I really don't know how to live very well,|sd
and I wonder, I really do wonder how people do that.|sd
That's interesting.|ba
Are th-, are there any other specific things that, that you feel like, where, where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency?|qy
All the class-, the other classic examples, the Jehovah's Witness or, or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door, um, which is more intrusive because I have to really tell someone to go away.|na
And there's that sense of, I have now opened my door they now see what I look like, what I live like|sd
and nor-, and they're doing something that normally I really only invite,|sd
Okay.|bk
Because I, any, anyone, any friend, anyone I give my number to is welcome to call me,|sd
but no one is just welcome to come by my house.|sd
So that is more of a sense of invasion.|sv
So, that's another example of the invasion because of the not so ... -|%
Hi Diana.|fp
Hi|fp
Have you all been able to do much as a family these days?|qy
Pardon me.|br
Have you all been able to do much as, uh, as a full family these days, all of you.|qy

an, an then, uh, you know, my husband enjoys spending time with the kids, you know,|sd
he'll, he'll take them out just to be with them.|sd

an, -|%
That's wha-, yeah, that's what we mostly do, pretty simple things.|sd
Yeah.|b
Especially since my youngest one is excuse me, only fourteen months.|sd
Right.|b
She, she's really getting to the age where she's playing,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
and with, you know, me being at home and just having the one income, you know, you don't have, this lot of extra money to, to do a lot of, you know, extra things.|sd
That's right.|aa
So, you, you make more fun than, you know. -|sv
You know the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or,|sd
Oh that's a big thrill for them.|sv
they, they think that's a lot of fun.|sd
So we just, we try to spend as much time as we can.|sd
We, you know -|%
our, our whole weekends are divi-, are devoted to our children except for we might go out, you know, one evening or something,|sd
Yeah.|b
but during the day, you know, it's all devoted to our kids|sd
and they come, go to church with us|sd
and so. -|%
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
Yeah,|b
so. -|%
Have, um, have you ever been to the Science, it's called the Science Place?|qy
Yes,|ny
yes,|ny
that's what. -|%
We ju-, we haven't lived here too long|sd
and we went there a couple of weeks ago|sd
and, uh, -|%
Uh-huh,|b
the kids thought that was wonderful.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
we, -|%
I guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two.|sd
We've only been in, I think it's Science Place Two.|sd
I, is, I'm not sure which one we went into,|sd
it was about a year or so ago, when we went.|sd
The one we went in had, uh, -|sd
the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that, like a kid's place area.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
That really seem, they really seemed to go wild in there.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah|aa
they had a lot of fun in there|sd
and, uh, there's, uh, there's some petting, you know, like, uh, uh, -|sd
I think it's Owens Country Farms has a free petting, you know, like a farm that you can go to|sd
and the kids can pet animals and stuff.|sd
Where's that.|qw
That's on Plano Road,|sd
uh, it's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road,|sd
it's like a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And that's a lot of fun.|sd
Oh yeah.|b
They have tours going through there|sd
and, uh, the kids think that was a lot of fun, too.|sd
Oh, that does sound like fun.|ba
It's a little bit of a ways,|sv
We take, you know, whenever we take them to Showbiz -|sd
or they think it's wonderful just to go to McDonald's, you know,|sd
they don't go for the food|sd
they go for the, to play around|sd
and,|sd
That's right.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
and it's a indoor fun park|sd
and it has a bunch of different rides for kids.|sd
That's sounds fun too.|ba
And parents get in free|sd
and it's like, during the week,|sd
it's like five dollars admission per child, all day.|sd
And, and you said about Plano and Campbell is the petting,|qy^d
The petting farm,|^2
yeah.|ny
That sounds fun|ba
I think maybe we'll try to do that.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah|b
and the one in Mesquite is, uh, Scyene exit.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it's, it's, uh, -|%
the kids just had a wonderful time there,|sd
they, you know, you just pay that admission,|sd
and then all the, the, the rides are free.|sd
You know, of course, they have all the little video games and, you know, those little quarter rides, you know, to, and stuff like that|sd
but,|sd
Yeah.|b
You can have birthday parties there|sd
an, I think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza cause there's more for them to do.|sv
Because they can just do, -|%
you don't have to have tokens for everything.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
right.|na
Yeah.|b
So they had a lot of fun.|sd
That does sound like fun.|ba
Well I've gotten some good ideas from you|sd
Yeah.|b
I, we try to do a lot of things as a family and, you know, inexpensively as possible,|sd
so. -|%
Definitely.|aa
Well, I think, I don't know if we've done five minutes|fc

that will be good,|fc

Well, um, with credit cards is, me, I, uh, I try to get maybe just one or two,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I don't, I don't like having credit cards for every store.|sd
I, I, uh, I just don't like them|sd
What are you afraid of with them?|qw
What am I afraid of?|qy
Yes.|ny
Um, I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much.|sd
I just, uh, don't think that I need them, you know.|sv
I, -|%
uh, they are tempting at times,|sv
but I, I just, you know, sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing everything about me, you know,|sd
so, -|%
Well, that's very, can be very, very true.|aa
So, and th-, you know, everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money|sv
so, -|%
Well, that's the idea.|sv
They figure that,|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and, -|%
That's right.|aa
See they make money off of it, whether you use it or not.|sv
Absolutely.|aa
Well, the other thing, of course, is the fact that they hope,|sv
That's right.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
I use mine a great deal, um, for groceries, for everything that I can and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's what I do.|sd
right.|%
That's what I do.|sd
Just a second. to child in|ad
Sorry|fa
That's all right.|bd
Sounds like you have a little one there.|bf
I have two little ones.|sd
Yes.|aa
Oh, you have.|bh
Yeah.|ny
So tha-, -|%
Great.|ba
How old are they?|qw
um, four and two and half.|sd
Oh, boy. Those are two very active ages|sv
Yes.|aa
So, yeah,|aa
um, I'm, I'm like you|sv
I, I use my, only use my credit card for, um, you know, when I, you know, -|sd
I just use it whenever I feel like I don't want to write a check,|sd
and then, but I don't charge anything that I can't payoff at the end of the month.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
Well, uh, do you, uh, do you ever use the A T M machines?|qy
No,|nn
I never do.|sd
My husband does at work just to get cash out,|sd
but, uh, I take the checkbook|sd
so I, you know, I, just, if I need cash, I just tell him|sd
and he gets it out|sd
and I don't even think I know my number|sd
Well, I find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That's right.|aa
See we, he couldn't do without it, h-, but, you know, since he can just do it right there at work,|sd
Oh, that helps.|^2
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
Well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use their A, their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very day on.|sv
You're right.|aa
And that's kind of silly.|sv
Yeah right.|aa
Absolutely.|aa
Yeah.|b
Because they,|sv
You're defeating the purpose.|sv
The idea is to use their money|sv
Yeah.|b
And, uh, during that whole month and,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
I mean, I get, I get at least one or two a week.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Because I, -|%
Well, I think that's the only thing you can do, is just say no and mean no and,|sv
Yeah.|aa
It's like,|sd
Well, i-, -|%
You've already been preapproved.|^q
oh, absolutely,|aa
preapproved.|aa
That's their favorite word.|sv
Yes.|aa
Everybody in the country is preapproved, I think.|sv
I think so, you're right.|aa
So, -|%
Well, it's interesting, uh, that, uh,|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
And, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, I didn't realize I had this much,|sv
That much stuff.|^2
Right.|b
And, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it.|sv
Well, and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and, I mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it does because you're, you know, you, you're, you know, you're just co-, costing yourself more money because you, if you can't make the monthly, the minimum payment, you're paying interest,|sv
That's right.|ba
so, -|%
That's right.|ba
Yeah|b
so, -|%

That's the only thing I found out tonight|sd
Oh, you found that out tonight?|qy
Yeah.|ny
I haven't even heard that,|^h
that's great.|ba
I think he deserves every penny of it.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting.|sd
Well, isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
Wonder because football, -|%
And they play a lot, they play a lot longer season, too.|sd
And a lot more games, right?|qy
Yeah,|ny
that's exactly right.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
But I think, let's see,|^h
the teams that were there last year were, see, somebody from California,|sd
I don't even know who won the pennant last year.|qw^d
Beats me.|no
I mean, I know Yankees have won a lot games|sv
Yeah|b
Not lately though|sv
We have been talking about this,|sd
I tried to call earlier,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we had made a list of all these, uh, baseball teams and the cities that they were from,|sd
then I started cleaning|sd
and I don't even know where I even put that paper|sd
Threw it away|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
I was just cleaning and throwing,|sd
Oh, gosh.|ba
Let's see.|^h
The teams that, -|%
I think the A's were in it last year.|sd
The Oakland A's, and I think it was, I don't think it was an all California baseball.|sd
Well, have you ever played baseball?|qy
I played softball.|no
Well, that's what I did when I was growing up.|sd
Yeah.|b
That was fun.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's fun|aa
That's a whole different sport.|sv
Uh-huh. in|b
Yeah,|b
let's see,|^h
but I think, I think the Rangers need to go|sv
and I think the Pirates will go.|sv
And, uh, let's see,|^h
Rangers have got a new guy this year,|sd
I don't even remember his name either.|sd
Do you ever go see the Rangers?|qy
Every once in a while I, I like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there, not very many people out there.|na
It's a lot more fun when your not fighting a crowd.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I think it's fun,|sv
I like just looking at the billboards.|sd
Yeah.|b
B-, -|%
sometimes when I, if you go out there during the day, you just fry under the sun.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it's nice at night.|sv
Yeah.|aa
That's when I've been.|sd
It is. -|aa
Well, -|%
And do you know anything about that new stadium,|qy
have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there?|qy
No.|nn
Yeah,|b
that, that huge -|%
it's suppose to be a huge stadium|sd
and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it.|sd
And, uh, they're going to try to make it a real community center out there.|sd
Cou-, -|%
And your going to be able to buy your, -|qy
what was, no, wait about the liquor? -|qy
That's, that's in, uh, Texas stadium where the football players,|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
so you, -|%
and they're never going to let liquor in there.|sd
Well, they're trying.|sv
I know,|aa
but they try every year|sv
and every year they get thrown out.|sv
It's so stupid because they let you take it in there,|sv
but they don't, they don't allow you to sell it, don't allow them to sell it there.|sd
Uh-huh|b
But, uh, that new stadium's going to be real nice,|sd
and I heard that there's, uh, that you can bid on that stadium|sd
last night on the news I heard that they said you could, you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you,|sd
so. -|%
Uh-huh,|b
right.|b
And it's going to go to the highest bidder|sd
Oh Well, that's the way to do it.|sv
Yeah,|aa
so that could be your, you know, fifteen minutes of fame.|sv
You hear that?|qh
That's my kids turning on their music.|sd
Oh.|b
to child in the Holly turn it down.|t3
I think it's the Bart man, the Simpsons|sd
Oh, God I stay away from them.|sd
I wish I could|sd
I bet you do.|ba
Well, where are you?|qw
In Plano.|sd
Okay,|bk
I'm in Garland.|sd

my h-, my husband teaches in Plano.|sd
Oh, what's he teach?|qw
C V A E.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, what do you do?|qo
I teach,|sd
but I teach for Dallas.|sd
Oh, you do?|bh
For right now.|na
I'm trying to get out.|sd
Is that a tough system to be in?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Real hard?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Yeah,|b
I would think it,|ba
I mean it's good because they, they try new things, you know,|sv
but it's like, they'll try something|sd
and then they throw it out, and get something else, you know,|sd
Yeah.|b
and you get tired of that.|sv
That's typical bureaucracy though.|sv
That's, that's, I think it's going to be any where you go|sv
it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones,|sv
Yeah.|b
I don't know,|h
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad.|sv
Well, but they can't be though,|ar
they don't have as much money.|sv
Yeah,|b
Most of the time.|sv
but the politics, the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes.|sv
Oh man, in Dallas you don't even know who's in, in administration,|sd
there's so many of them|sd
You don't even know who to payoff, huh?|qh
I mean, somebody walks in the, a classroom|sd
and you don't know what they're there for, you know, when they're coming, how long they're going to be,|sd
Yeah,|b
oh, how funny.|ba
you know, it's just there they are|sd
and they're writing the whole time|sd
No communication whatsoever.|qy^d
No.|nn
I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything,|sd
and I finally just got to where I go, okay, I'm Debbie Moore, you know, may I ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
Because, you know, you never know where they are going what they'll report|sd
or, -|%
I know.|aa
and they'll tell you they've written something down,|sd
and you hope they're telling you the truth.|sd
And you never see it.|qy^d
No|nn
huh-uh.|nn
That's got to be frustrating.|ba
Oh, it is.|aa
How long you taught, taught in Dallas schools?|qw
Uh, this is my eleventh year.|sd
Ugh, that's about, uh, ten too many.|sv
No,|ar
actually it's, -|%
now my job's good,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
and all I do is teach reading all day long,|sd
Oh.|b
and it's just ten children at a time.|sd
Oh, well, that's not bad.|ba
No.|aa
It's good,|aa
and you've got a lot of federal money, too.|sd
But hasn't it changed a lot over the years?|qy
Teaching?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Oh, yes.|ny
Or working in the system.|qy^d
Yes,|ny
when I first started teaching, I remember I went to my -|sd
and I said, okay, I want to see a curriculum guide, you know,|sd
so I'll know what I'm suppose to teach|^q
and they go, we don't have one.|sd
We don't even know where one is.|^q
Oh, God|ba
And so I go, okay, I mean, you just, you did what you wanted to do,|sd
How funny.|ba
and now they tell you what to teach and how long and, you know, what day,|sd
Yeah,|b
you don't know which is,|sv
Yeah.|b
No,|ar
I know which is worse.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I guess so.|aa
Yeah,|aa
being told what to do is worse.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So, how long are we suppose to talk for?|qw
Well, you can talk for ten minutes|sd
but you don't have to.|sd
Oh, you can?|bh
Yeah,|ny
and no,|nn
if you talk to ten then they come ov-, on and say, oh, you've extended your limit,|sd
and please say good-bye within the next five seconds.|^q
Oh, I haven't ever talked that long.|sd
Well, you know, I hadn't either till last night, I was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland, Ohio,|sd
Uh-huh .|b
and we started talking about gangs, you know.|sd
He lives in Cleveland?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Wow.|ba
And, everybody else that I've talked to has been right around here.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, she was real interesting.|sd
Huh.|b
And then tonight this woman called,|sd
have you taken any incoming calls?|qy
Th-, yours is my second one.|na
Okay.|bk
So hers was the first one I got, gotten|sd
and, uh, and she was telling me all her problems, you know,|sd
and it went over ten minutes.|sd
Did she, did she, did you all not talk about the topic at all?|qy
Well, yeah,|ny
we did,|sd
but the topic was boring I thought.|sd
Oh.|bk
What would you serve, uh, if you were having a dinner party?|qw
Oh, gosh, all the other, -|%
the one I talked about the other night was good,|sd
it was, um, about movies, you know, what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that.|sd
Oh yeah,|b
I could go on and on about that.|sd
Me, too, because we go all the time,|sd
the guy I was talking to never goes,|sd
he was, boy it sounds like your really up on this.|sd
I said, I see at least two a week|sd
Ugh, neat.|ba
So, that was real good to talk about that.|sd
Have you seen like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?|qy
No.|nn
You've got to go see that.|ad
The last one I saw was DANCES OF THE, WITH THE WOLVES, WOLVES.|sd
Yeah,|b
we talked about that one too.|sd
And he, he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards, he thought it was too long|sd
but I, -|%
Oh, I enjoyed it.|sd
I did, too.|sd
I mean, it was just more for my money.|sv
Yeah.|b
I didn't think it was too long at all.|sd
Uh, he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch.|sd
Huh.|b
The other one you need to go see is SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.|ad
Uh-huh.|aa
And, how old are your kids?|qw
One is eight|sd
and one is eleven.|sd
You probably don't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.|ad
It's, it's not, it's not too cool for kids.|sv
They usually pick their own.|sd
I bet they do.|ba
You know, they've got it all figured out.|sd
Yeah,|b
they want to see all the horror movies.|qy^d
Well, and Ninja Turtles.|arp_nd
Yeah,|b
Ninja Turtles, got to have those.|aa
But most of the time really we watch them on the video.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
you brin-, -|%
that's, -|%
Don't you?|qy
Just massive rental.|qy^d
well heck, that's a lot cheaper then, uh,|sv
Going to, -|%
I know.|aa
Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one ni-, one time.|sv
That's what we do, especially when it's bad weather, man, just,|sd
Yeah.|b
Of course, you have to get there early if you want to get anything,|sv
I know in|aa
It's good when you go to Tom Thumb though|sv
and they're cheap|sv
and nobody has got them yet.|sv
That's true.|aa
Unbelievable|ba
That's true.|aa
We saw, um, HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COWBOYS, tonight.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It was okay,|sd
it was kind of slow,|sd
and I felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end, you know.|sd
It just, it, -|%
I don't know,|h
it one of those movies it's not going to be around long,|sd
it will be a dollar movie in no time.|sd
Do you read?|qy
Not very much,|ng
no.|nn
No?|bh
I don't have the patience to read|sd
See I do that to make myself go to sleep at night.|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh, my Mom and Dad read all the time.|sd
You saw FIELD OF DREAMS, right, a long time ago?|qy
Yeah,|ny
sure did.|sd
Well, I was reading the book,|sd
and it's called SHOELESS JOE.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
It was so wonderful.|sd
And then I was, um, I decided, well, I like this author,|sd
so I got a, uh, book of his short stories,|sd
and that's been real good.|sd
Who is the, is the author?|qw
Don't, don't ask me|no
Oh|bk
The GHOST OF SHOELESS JOE was the name of the book.|sd
Shoeless Joe.|b^m
Was it like the movie?|qy
Yes,|ny
Okay.|bk
quite a, quite a bit.|sd
But, you know, in the movie the guy was black,|sd
Right.|b
he wasn't in the book,|sd
Huh.|b
that's one difference.|sd
There really wasn't a lot of difference.|sd
I didn't,|sd
see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie.|sd
That's interesting.|ba
That was a good movie, too.|sv
Well, do you think we covered baseball?|qy
I think so|na
Okay,|fc
well, have a good night.|fc
Well, um, I'm, uh, pretty pro gun control over all.|sd
I, uh, I've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control|sd
and, uh, I must say that there are a couple of arguments against, uh, strong gun control which I find very compelling, although most the people who argue gun control with me I find, uh, use sort of canned arguments, you know, sort of the N R A slogan arguments|sd
and, um, uh, see I've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it. Um,|sd
I guess on a one, a scale of one of ten I'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns|sd
and I have to admit most of that is, uh, strong personal distaste.|sd
I don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort. Um,|sd
and, uh, guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me.|sd
Well, me being from Texas -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I hope you're ready for this.|qy^d
Um, uh, I'll give it a try.|na
I've got my Texan stereotypes in place.|sd
Well, I'm not your stereotypical Texan.|sd
I was raised around guns, hunting.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So I don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I resp-, I respect them and what their capabilities are.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military, as a Green Beret, I definitely respect the power of weaponry.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's pretty power isn't it|qy
And here in Houston, as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country, -|sd
and here, here, here you go,|^h
here you, -|%
this will be border line N R A which I am not a member of.|sd
Okay.|b
Okay.|b
When you, I mean, you've heard the, the slogan, um, if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns.|qy^d
Uh-huh.|ny
That applies to anything as well as guns.|sv
a gun. -|%
Well, you, you've got, -|%
well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs|sv
and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And they get out their little Mac tens,|sv
they get out their little uzis|sv
and they're going to fight with them.|sv
And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm.|sv
If they want it they'll get it.|sv
I don't care if, if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it|sv
they'll get it|sv
and they'll get across the border.|sv
Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it.|sv
If they want to run a background check on me, fine.|sd
If they want to put a seven day waiting period, fine, again.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
If they want, want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that I've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county, that's fine too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
What I don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it's it wouldn't, -|sv
you don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way, I would hope. I mean, because I mean someone -|sv
the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get to have a gun|sd
and someone the personal sheriff, -|%
Well, -|%
the only, well, the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has, is this guy a convicted felon? Uh,|sv
is he a habitual trouble maker?|^q
Are we picking him up every Saturday,|^q
Yeah.|b
and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems.|^q
You know, just proving that you're a basically a good citizen. -|sv
But if you're not a, if you're not a basically good citizen, -|sv
you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway.|sv
If, if they want the firepower they can get it.|sv
So why hav-, -|%
because it doesn't matter how restrictive your border control points are|sv
they'll get it across the border one way or the other.|sv
So why have any restrictions at all?|qh
Uh, okay.|b
Let-, -|%
go back to that one to ten scale where one,|ad
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
I'd said about an eight.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well, we can could be, -|%
I said the restrictions I would like to see on, for anybody, whether it being for handgun, a rifle, a shotgun, -|sd
I would like to see them go through either,|sd
I'd like to see a law enforcement agency, not N R A,|sd
but whether it be the, your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun.|sv
You got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon, how to safely handle the weapon, how to properly maintain it, the three basics.|sv
Well, that makes a lot of since to me.|aa
I mean, I certainly feel that if, if, we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm|sv
but, uh, I certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do, use it safely as someone learns how to drive, if not more so.|aa
Well, the han-, -|%
in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon,|sv
Yeah|b
Well, I have a bicycle|sd
and that scares me too to tell you the truth because I've been run off the road and all sorts of things.|sd
Well, I'm still, I'm still puzzled though, what is the argument,|qw
how does the argument work if, uh, if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway.|qw
What's the point of putting a restrictio-,|qw
basically, the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway|sv
they're not going to take those courses.|sv
Is it, uh, is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns?|qy
Well there's, -|%
If it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices|sv
does that, uh, mean advantage?|qy
Uh, not necessarily a price thing.|ng
What is happening at least in this state -|sd
and I expect to see it in other states very soon,|sv
legislation been introduced as that, if a citizen of the state, being,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Okay.|b
You, you're, you're from California, right?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
L A area?|qy
Uh, no.|nn
Bay area.|sd
San Francisco,|sd
Okay.|bk
Okay.|bk
You've been to the city?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
And all these people come around,|sv
someone attempts to mug me I would ju-, -|sv
I would, -|%
as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because I can meet him blade for blade.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Now if this legislation comes through,|sd
he pull-, -|%
I'm out with my family --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- we've gone shopping,|sd
we're fixing to get in the car,|sd
this guy comes up,|sd
he pulls a blade on me.|sd
I can pull a gun on him now.|sd
When you're, and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick.|sv
What if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon?|qw
Then it's still equally matched.|sv
Having,|sd
I, -|%
Yeah.|b
Well, -|%
If I'm,|sd
I'm, I'm sure,|b
I'm sure given all,|sv
if I walk into a bad neighborhood I'm sure I'd want to walk through with you because I'm sure you have good, you know, fa-, far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything.|sd
Um, I'm, quite concerned that if you let everyone -|sv
hasn't yet used a gun in a, haven't, hasn't yet committed a felony, -|sv
if you let them all walk around carrying guns -|sv
in this sort of wild west scenario, you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature.|sv
You're going to start getting a lot of gunfire.|sv
It's, it's hard for me to imagine that a, a situation of, you know, -|sd
take it to a logical extreme,|ad
if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire.|sv
I, actually it's no-, -|%
it's more of a police action in itself,|sv
the fact that everybody is packing a piece is a deterrence for someone saying, well, I'm going to mug this guy right here|sv
but hey, he's carrying just as much firepower as I can.|^q
And if they're sca-, if you got to go through a certification course to get where, to where you can carry it in public,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh|b
but. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
In defense of myself, defense of my family or defense of my friends I can blow somebody a way in a heart beat.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
Anybody,|sv
I know,|ba
No.|aa
I, I understand that.|ba
What if, uh, what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake?|qw
This, this is where the question of gun control comes in.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Well, uh, that,|sd
What,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Say a person, uh, uh, get, -|%
all of a sudden my combat in me goes up|sd
and say I've got the vibes, this guy's fixing to do something,|sd
I go ahead and pull my piece.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that I will use it on him|sd
and I will use it right then.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
If he doesn't back up at that point he deserves what he gets because I have sent the clearest signal you mess with me, you mess with my family, I'm going to dust you.|sv
As it stands now I've got to do that with a blade.|sd
And the only reason I feel confid-, com-, com-, comfortable doing that is because of the training I've had.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well as, as someone who would, would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander, I feel more comfortable with people having blades because, uh, you're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly|sd
and, uh, -|%
Well, if I'm the one doing the shooting I don't miss.|sd
That's the kind of training I've had.|sd
I mean ... -|%
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
this is really ironic that this would, I would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away|sd
Oh, no.|ba
And it's just been tearing me up all day|sd
Oh, I bet.|ba
Because we have just been looking all over for him.|sd
We've been to the pound,|sd
we've been to the humane society,|sd
we've been to the adoption center,|sd
we've just been all over the neighborhood,|sd
we've been calling neighbors|sd
So this is just really strange|sd
Oh, I guess so.|aa
Have you lost him before?|qy
No,|nn
this is the first time.|sd
Um, he's gotten out before,|sd
but he's always stayed right here --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
he's never gone away.|sd
And so this is just really strange, you know because, -|sd
What kind of a dog is he?|qw
Um, he's part golden Lab and part, uh, let's see, Alaskan, no, not Alaskan.|sd
I always forget|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, Australian shepherd.|sd
Oh,|bk
boy, he's a big one.|qy^d
he's pretty big.|sd
That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before,|sd
and, I would think, you know, he might, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something.|sd
I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, but, I don't know|h
Oh, well, I hope he comes back,|sd
that's too bad.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Thanks,|ft
I do, too|sd
How long have you had him?|qw
Oh, about two years.|sd
So, he's -|%
Oh, that's tough.|ba
Yeah,|aa
it's really, -|%
gosh, anyway, -|ba
Yeah,|b
you get very attached to animals, don't you?|qy
That, isn't that funny how we do?|qh
Yeah.|ny
I mean, we just really, -|%
Well, you know, they're always there for you|sv
and they don't talk back to you|sv

And, uh, it's kind of pleasant.|sv
Well, they're companions,|sv
Yeah,|aa
sure,|aa
sure.|aa
Well, do you have any?|qy
Yes,|ny
we have a dog, a little white Lhasa.|sd
And her name is Angel.|sd

and his name is Dominique.|sd
We call him Neek.|sd
Um,|b
But, -|%
How do they get along together?|qw
Pretty good.|sd
Uh, we've, we had the, the dog first,|sd
and, uh, she's kind of a wimp|sd
and,|sd
but, uh, she likes him all right.|sd
He, we had another cat about two years ago.|sd
It got leukemia, feline leukemia --|sd
Um.|b
and, uh, then we got this new cat,|sd
so, uh. I have two children|sd
and they really enjoy the animals.|sd
And then my mother who's very elderly lives with us,|sd
and she's really good friends with the dog.|sd
They're very,|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
That's what are so neat about animals,|sv
I mean, they are, you know, like I said, they're, they're really companions, you know,|sv
and they're friends,|sv
That's right.|aa
I mean, they, you can love them all you want|sv
and they love you right back|sv
and they don't -|%
That's right.|ba
They don't care what you look like,|sv
No.|aa
They just love you, unconditionally.|sv
I know.|aa
It's wonderful.|sv
It's just so neat. You know,|sv
it's, -|%
that's, -|%
I don't know|h
this is just so hard.|sd
Oh, I know it has to be.|aa
It's just, it's like I said, we've had him for two years|sd
and he's never, -|%
I mean, he's, he's gotten out,|sd
but he's always been right there.|sd
He's never been gone for, at all --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
-- you know, he's just always been right there when he gets out.|sd
Oh.|b
You know, it's the first time he's ever been gone like this|sd
Oh, that's really too bad,|ba
that's awful, well,|ba
Uh, I, I just knew today, uh, you know, that we looked at the pound, and that we just went all over the place,|sd
and I knew we were going to find him, you know,|sd
and when we didn't it was, like, oh, no,|sd
So I don't know.|h
Well, I, I'll, I hope you'll find him.|sd
You most likely will.|sv
Yeah,|aa
we keep, you know, -|%
they told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center, you know, don't give up hope, you know,|sd
Well, have you put any posters up or anything like that?|qy
We were talking about that tonight since, you know, he, we just, he just got out yesterday|sd
we were just talking about that whether -|sd
we, we were trying to find some pictures of him recently.|sd
We've got so many when he was a puppy|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
you know, but we just don't have a whole lot.|sd
We have him on film, you know, on the video camera|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
You know, but you can't put that on the -|sd
No,|aa
you sure can't.|aa
you know, so|h
Oh, dear.|ba
I, we will probably will put some things up. Some posters and stuff up|sd
Well, that's good.|ba
And hopefully that will help, you know, maybe around the neighborhood.|sd
But, we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood,|sd
so that helps, too, you know, if they can keep, -|sd
They can keep their eyes open,|^2
yeah.|%
yeah,|b^m
so, -|%
That will help.|sv
Well, -|%
I think that if somebody else picks him up, -|sv
I think that, uh, if he gets out he'll come back.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know. I really do, because he knows exactly where he lives,|sd
so -|%
Yeah,|b
yeah|b
he will.|aa
I bet he does.|aa
I know, that it's hard on you.|sd
I know that I'd be worried, too.|sd
I know.|aa
It's just like, it's, it's just so ironic that this would happen|sd
and I would get this, this kind of a call|sd
Yeah,|aa
isn't it, though?|bh
I know,|na
That's, -|%
it's very strange|sd
but, -|%
You know, I know sometimes our cat will, will stay out all night,|sd
and when he's not right at the door in the morning I really worry that something's happened to him, that somebody, he's got in a fight or, you know, somebody's hit him|sd
and, and uh, if he doesn't come by mid morning, then I really get scared.|sd
But he's always come back eventually|sd
so, -|%
Well, that's good.|ba
That's one thing about cats though,|sv
they're so small --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- and, you know, they can get hurt a lot easier.|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, they can get hurt a lot easier,|sv
Yeah,|b
they can.|aa
so that would make you really,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
Well, but he's a real feisty guy.|sd
He fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property.|sd
Is that right?|bh
He's, -|%
cats are really almost more territorial than, than dogs are.|sd
They just really do not want other animals on their property.|sd
They're very, very -|%
he, he just -|%
any cat that comes near, and even a dog he won't, he won't jump at them or anything,|sd
but he'll sit|sd
and he'll watch,|sd
and, I think maybe he would if it came real close,|sd
but he's very protective of our property.|sd
Huh.|b
That's really, -|%
I, I guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so I never had them growing up,|sd
Yeah.|b
so, you know, I never really had them around me, you know,|sd
so I've never owned one you know, since I, -|sd
Well, they're really a lot different than dogs because they're not, they're very independent,|sd
and they're very, he's very affectionate when he wants to be,|sd
but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be, he'll just, he'll, you know either scratch you or run away.|sd
Huh.|b
But when he wants to be, uh, he's really affectionate.|sd
He likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and, and, and snuggle up to you,|sd
and, but if he's not in the mood, you'd better stay away from him.|sd
Huh|b
But, dogs seem to be always in the mood.|sv
They're always, you know, right there, and like, like you to pet them and loving.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true|aa
I, I like the way they come up|sd
and they'll, they'll put their head underneath your hand, you know.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah, oh.|b
that, -|%
and, uh, most dogs do that.|sv
I mean, -|%
Yeah,|aa
they do.|aa
I don't know any that really don't.|sd
I mean, you know, they know exactly how to get that attention, you know,|sv
They sure do.|aa
they just, you know, come up,|sv
and they put your, you know -- -|sv
Yeah.|b
-- or they'll rub their, their head against you, you know|sv
Now, do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs-,|qy
Well, no.|nn
Well, well, he's outside during the day|sd
and then we get home at night we do bring him in.|sd
You have a fenced yard or, -|qy
Uh-huh,|ny
Uh-huh.|b^m
yeah.|ny
The backyard, it's really big, too, for him to run in and stuff.|sd
That's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out|sd
Yeah.|b
and, but, -|%
Well, how did he get out?|qw
He dug a hole under the fence.|sd
Oh, boy.|ba
Well, see, he did, he did it a couple weeks ago, dug a hole,|sd
and, you know, we, we filled it back up --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
He did it again --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so we chained him up --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- you know, but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because, you know, we feel like that's just too restricting for him.|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
So, uh, we got, we, we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it, you know, so that he couldn't get out.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, he kind of ripped through the chicken wire|sd
Oh.|bk
So I can't, -|%
I, I, I just have not, -|%
I don't understand, you know, because it's, like, he's got a good home, you know,|sd
he's got, -|%
I mean, we have two kids, you know, that just love him a lot,|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
You know, it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out, you know,|sd
we just couldn't, -|sd
Well, you know, that, animals are like that.|sv
They like to roam and investigate.|sv
Yeah|aa
I guess that's, -|%
Yeah,|aa
I guess that's probably true.|aa
I don't think it's anything we did|sv
No.|aa
Least I hope not|sd
No.|aa
I'm sure that, yeah, -|sv
No,|aa
I, I know,|aa
I mean he's always, you know, he really does have a good home.|sd
I think that's what really bothers me the most about it|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, it's like, -|%
How are your kids handling it?|qo
Well, I don't know if it's quite hit him, hit them.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I have two girls,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they, they just been real, uh, -|sd
I don't know,|h
at first, you know, they seemed to be upset,|sd
but now it's like, uh, well if he doesn't come home, can we get another dog|sd
yeah,|b
that sounds like kids.|sv
It's like, wait a minute you know,|sd
Oh.|b
poor Buddy, you know.|^q
I said, he's only been gone a day|sd

What's his name,|qw
did you call?|qy
Buddy.|sd
Buddy?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
We, that's was our cat's name that, that, that died.|sd

Oh, yeah.|ny
We named him, uh, we named him Buddy after, uh, Buddy Bell, uh, the Ranger baseball player that used to be here.|sd
Oh|bk
And we used to, -|%
we were really into that when we got him going to the Ranger games,|sd

But, Buddy after Buddy Bell,|sd
so, -|%
That's funny.|ba
But, he was, he was a good cat, too.|sd
We miss him a lot,|sd
Yeah.|b
and I, I feel real guilty because we had him, like, for six years|sd

and he got it.|sd
Oh.|b
And I just felt so bad,|sd
I, it's real contagious|sd
and it's, -|%
and the vet said it runs rampant in this area|sd
I didn't know that.|sd
and if they don't have their booster, any kind of saliva or anything from another cat, if they get in a fight it automatically, like, -|sd
they get it if the other cat has it|sd
so, -|%
I had, I had no idea.|sd
Oh.|b
I did not know that.|sd
Oh.|b
It was, -|%
I just felt terrible.|sd
I knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was, -|sd
he was just getting real skinny. fade|sd
Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

the question was about, uh, physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, uh, I, I don't do it as much as I should.|sd
I try to walk.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, last year I would, I did it every day,|sd
but I've kind of, in ninety-one I've kind of gone down hill.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so I'm not doing it as much as I need to,|sd
but I, I can tell you when I do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better --|sd
I agree|aa
But it's just to get motivated to do it,|sd
and once I get started, and, and, I, I, I ca-, I do it every night.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's just to get, uh, motiv-, motivated again,|sd
and what happened about couple of weeks ago I started again.|sd
And I was walking,|sd
and it got kind of dark.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I was by myself,|sd
and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block.|sd
Ooh.|b
And, so I, I kind of got frightened,|sd
and I kind of use that as an excuse.|sd
All I have to do,|sd
but. -|%
Right.|b
I haven't walked since,|sd
so. -|%
It's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise.|sv
I know what you mean.|ba
Yeah,|aa
it sure is.|aa
It sure is.|aa
How about you?|qo
Do you exercise on a regular basis?|qy
Um, well, I try to.|na
Um, I started at the beginning of this year,|sd
I decided all right, I'm going to start exercising again,|sd
I'm going to be real good,|^q
and I went through the T I fitness center and registered for the, uh, aerobics classes there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they run for two months at a time.|sd
And you have to, you do have to pay to take them.|sd
And I took, I signed up for one that was three nights a week, an hour and a half,|sd
so that was four and a half hours a week.|sd
Oh.|bk
And it cost sixty dollars,|sd
and I thought, okay, that's not cheap,|sd
that'll encourage me to always go since I spent that much money.|^q
Right.|b
And I had a friend of mine going,|sd
so I was real good,|sd
I only missed it about three times.|sd
And then, oh, March came around,|sd
and I signed up again,|sd
and I got, uh, caught up with a class I was taking at T I,|sd
and then I was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after I got out of class.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then I went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the T I up there.|sd
And so that was two weeks I had missed,|sd
and, boy, I tell you what, I've been terrible ever since then.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's once you get out of that habit --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Because I teach school,|sd
and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class.|sd
We went in together and hired a private instructor,|sd
and she came to our school twice a week.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, I, I was, -|%
I would go faithfully,|sd
and then I missed once.|sd
Then I went back again a couple times and missed another time, and then kept missing and never went back again.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think, if you, -|%
you just have to stick with it.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
I think I've been two maybe three times the month of April,|sd
and this session is about to run out.|sd
Now I signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because I am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, and, uh, that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that.|sd
Yeah.|b
lately, uh, there's been nights that I could have gone|sd
and I've found excuses, uh --|sd
Yeah.|b
but I'm fine this week.|sd
I could have gone Monday.|sd
I could have gone tonight,|sd
and I didn't.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, I'm kind of finding excuses,|sd
and now it's kind of like, well, -|sd
this is the last week.|sd
I'll just start fresh next week.|sd
But, I better better do it.|sd
And I think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months.|sd
She started taking tennis lessons,|sd
and so I haven't had that extra motivation, of, of us forcing each other, or not forcing each other --|sd
Yeah.|b
So. -|%
Sure,|b
yeah|b
that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Like it's misery loves company.|sv
I don't really love exercise.|sd
I mean, some I, -|%
the neighbor across the street, she goes, belongs to President's,|sd
and, uh, it's not President's any more.|sd
I don't know what the name of it is anymore.|sd
But she loves it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, it's just, it's an automatic high for her.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
She just enjoys it so much.|sd
And I don't.|sd
Yeah.|b
I'm the same way.|sd
I feel good after I do it,|sd
but I hate it when I'm doing it.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, I just, -|sd
I don't enjoy it at all,|sd
and she just loves it.|sd
So. Even when she doesn't go to the health club, she runs, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, it's a daily thing for her.|sd
So, it, you know, -|%
and it's so hard for me.|sd
I envy her,|sd
I wish I could be that way,|sd
but I don't.|sd
I do too.|sd
and I have an older sister that loves running, too,|sd
and she runs all the time,|sd
but at, to me, it's every minute's agony,|sd
and I, -|%
in fact, I don't run.|sd
I hate to run.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Like when I walk I'll take along a radio or something|sd
and that helps, you know, pass the time.|sd
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
walking is kind of boring.|sv
I do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood,|sd
and we try to, we used to try to get together,|sd
and I think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking.|sd
There's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And it's not as boring if you get several people --|sv
That's right.|aa
-- and you can kind of talk,|sv
and, and it, it makes it pass pretty quickly,|sv
and the aerobics isn't too boring.|sv
I kind of enjoy it when I'm doing it. Um,|sd
it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do, I guess.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
But, uh, I do, I do have to make myself go,|sd
and of course while I'm doing it I feel pretty good,|sd
and after I get finished I feel great.|sd
Oh, it's great afterwards,|sv
yeah.|%
I mean, I can go in there,|sd
I can be, -|%
like a Friday afternoon when I'm tired, it's the end of the week and I just want to go home. And I'll make myself go,|sd
and I'll have headache and everything,|sd
and I get out,|sd
I don't have a headache any more.|sd
I feel great,|sd
and I'm just, -|%
it's amazing how much better I feel.|sd
Yeah.|b
And then just in general, I sleep a lot better --|sd
Yeah,|b
that's right.|aa
-- and I just feel much better.|sd
I mean, I've been kind of dragging the last few weeks,|sd
and I know if I would just get around to exercising --|sd
Exactly --|aa
-- it does,|sv
it gives you energy.|sv
But my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, I'm too tired,|sd
or I have a headache|sd
or, -|%
well, I just got over the flu,|^q
and I'm still kind of draggy|^q
so I better not go|^q
It's kind of a vicious circle isn't it?|qy
Yeah,|ny
it really is.|sd
Yeah,|b
I find, too, that I have more energy when I exercise,|sd
and, you know, it's silly not to,|sv
but, I don't know,|h
it's just a put off.|sv
I don't know why I don't do more,|sd
and I, and I know that it's good for my health.|sd
I know, you know, from everything that you read and you see on television now, exercise is so important to good health.|sd
Right.|b
So, you know, you, not only, you know, you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life.|sv
So. -|%
Right.|b
There's no reason that we shouldn't do it,|sv
but I don't know.|h
It's just hard to make yourself go.|sv
And I, I think one thing I don't like about aerobics is that after I'm finished it's kind of late at night,|sd
and I've been sweaty,|sd
and, and it, you know, -|%
I don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands.|sd
Yeah.|b
So it kind of kills the evening for doing errands.|sd
So I think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better.|sd
Yeah.|b
Of course, I feel like once I've done it, if I'm sweaty I might as well do an extra thirty minutes because you've already kind of shot your night.|sd
Right.|b
But, um, so I'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday, Thursday now that I can just kill two nights, and --|sd
Yeah.|b
Does it cost the same for just two nights or, -|qy
No,|nn
it's less expensive.|sd
Well, that's good, too.|ba
This one was only forty-five dollars.|sd
But I'm glad it's not too totally cheap, because if it was too cheap I would talk myself out of going more, probably.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Since it's more expensive, I think, Okay, you spent that much money, you'd better go|sd
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
So hopefully.|sd
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
it's right there,|sd
and it's, they have a really nice facility at the T I.|sd
They've got two different aerobics rooms,|sd
they have the mirrors.|sd
Of course, sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall --|sv
-- you don't like to see how you work.|sv
But, I guess, sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going.|sv
But, -|%
Yeah,|b
and then they hire private instructors?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Oh, that's great.|ba
And they have ceiling fans in the rooms,|sd
and it's, it's a pretty nice setup. Um,|sd
and of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work.|sd
I think if I had to come home and then go somewhere, I'd never make it.|sd
Yeah.|b
And just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the, the recreation center and do it helps a lot.|sd
Uh-huh.|aa
Yeah,|aa
I can see that would be, uh, easy.|ba
They make it as easy as they possibly can for you.|sv
Oh, yeah|b
Well, um, do a lot of people take advantage of it?|qy
Quite a few do.|na
They have probably, ooh, I'd say fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running,|sd
and they have them anywhere from six in the morning. Uh,|sd
they have some during, during lunch hour that are shorter,|sd
and I guess guys can take advantage of that.|sd
For me, I wouldn't have time to do an hour, hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get, get dressed again.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
But there's a lot more guys that do that one.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, um, they have them, you know, in the evenings,|sd
they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that.|sd
So they have big variety.|sd
They even have some, uh, aerobic, uh, water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool.|sd
I've never done that one before.|sd
But. -|%
Oh, you have a pool there, too?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Oh, how nice.|ba
They've got an olympic pool, and, and basketball courts and sand volleyball.|sd
They've got the full weight room and, uh, the locker rooms with, uh, a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities, and hair dryers, and all the, you know, everything you'd need just about.|sd
Wow.|ba
It's a real, it is a real nice facility.|sd
It's also got a full insid-, inside basketball court,|sd
and I think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things.|sd
But it's, it is very nice.|sd
That's great.|ba
I just don't take as much advantage of it as I should.|sd
Now to use, -|%
I mean, I'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing.|sd
But. -|%
Well, does it cost money like to use the, to exercise in the weight room or to, uh, to tak-, to go swimming.|qy
Do you have to pay for that, too.|qy
Yeah.|ny
You can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities,|sd
and it's about eight dollars a month.|sd
Oh, that's not bad.|ba
No,|aa
not at all|aa
Huh-uh.|b
Pretty cheap.|sv
Um.|b
And then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership,|sd
but, I think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced, from what I've heard.|sd
I think so too,|aa
yeah.|aa
Well, and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?|qy
Hm?|br
People of all ages take advantage of the aerobics?|qy
Oh, yeah,|ny
in fact, uh, the T I-er's families can come in on these things,|sd
Uh, national health insurance, I think, is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive.|sv
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
because, uh, the articles that I've read regarding national health service in Canada and England has indicated that, uh, -|sd
what i-, -|%
stay, stay in line for, uh, four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor.|sd
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
I'm, I'm sort of mixed on this.|sd
I think that the, the answer may lie in, uh, not in so much a, uh, national kind of medical thing that li-, like England has but more of a, um, national insurance, uh, sort of clearinghouse or whatever.|sv
I think that, uh, too many, uh, -|sv
the problem with, with right now is w-, that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through|sv
and, and I think that, I think you, you mentioned Canada.|sd
I think that they have a system where, uh, they, the government deals with the, with, -|sd
I mean, you, you go to whoever you want but file through one, one s-, particular,|sd
Um, I see.|b
and that way they, they are able to reduce prices because they've, you know, it's, it's all one, one centralized thing.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, I, I think that, uh, again having gone through a period when I was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|aa
Uh, I, I was listening, uh, on the radio the other day|sd
and they were talking that, s-, s-, something like this, -|sd
I think they were talking about the fact that, um, the money that could be saved, um, in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider, um, could, uh, could, -|sd
they could make it, i-, i-, provide health insurance to, to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Uh, we're currently, where I'm working now, under Blue Cross.|sd
I don't know what the total cost of the program is|sd
but for dependent coverage I'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that.|sd
Right.|b
So I assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably,|sd
They're probably picking up about half of it.|sd
Right.|b
And that's a pretty good policy,|sv
but if you had something like one of these, uh,|sv
Yeah,|b
H M O.|^2
Yeah,|aa
and they're, they're fairly expensive.|sv
I, I, um, I ha-, I was on an H M O, uh, up until last year --|sd
Yeah.|b
And it was, -|%
I forget how much I paid a month|sd
but it was much, you know, is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, the reason I, I quite was because of, uh, not because I didn't like it,|sd
I, I really kind of did.|sd
Uh, the reason I quite was just because the, the doctor a, a certain doctor that we en-, enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that H M O|sd
so we, my wife decided she wanted to, to stay with that doctor,|sd
Yeah.|b
so, we went to the, to the, the medical insurance that we have at, here at work,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, uh, I, uh, I like the, I like the convenience of the H M O in, in a certain respect because it, uh, even though you're, -|%
once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem.|sv
You know, a lot of people complain saying well, I don't want to, uh, have to be told who I need to go to|sv
but, you know, if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's right.|aa
and then, we did find several good doctors.|sd
And, um, like you say it's, uh, five dollars an office visit.|sd
And, um, my wife was in the hospital had our, had our daughter|sd
and I think her total bill was around three hundred dollars --|sd
Oh, goodness.|ba
Delivery room and everything.|bf
Yeah.|b
Include-, including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay|sd
but that was, that was still included in that pr-, that cost|sd
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
It's really nice because they, th-, you know, their, their attitude is different than, than a regular, uh, insurance, uh, health insurance, uh, the, in, in a, H M O, you know,|sv
they're trying to prevent a problem by, by keeping the cost down at the front end,|sv
Yeah.|b
they, they charge five dollars|sd
a s-,|sd
Yeah.|b
you're more willing to go in and try,|sv
As to a company's benefit,|sv
Yeah.|b
Because they don't have to worry about going in and, and paying,|sv
Right.|b
That's a, -|%
Yeah,|aa
I, I, uh, I, I really liked it.|sd
We both, my wife and I both did.|sd
You, you don't have to worry about filling out forms, uh, you know, for reimbursement and all or, you know, getting paid eight percent of, of whatever.|sv
You just pay the, the five dollars right then|sv
and then you're done with it.|sv
Yeah.|aa
But here again the, the doctor's practices in hospitals,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, you take a hospital, uh, the physical plant itself,|sv
you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building, uh, when the e-, rooms are empty.|sv
Right.|b
So, they spread the costs out over, uh, all the patient costs|sv
and, uh, that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that.|sv
Right.|b
Well, they, and you know, they're also p-, -|%
take-, -|%
they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay.|sv
Right.|b
You know, they, they get a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, people who are j-, just have to be there and can't afford it|sv
and so they, they know they're not going to get pa-,|sv
Yeah.|b
so they,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
My daughter and son-in-law had a baby,|sd
he-, he'll be three in August.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, their insurance plan that they're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital.|sd
Right.|b
And like she went in,|sd
she had the baby|sd
and she was out in two days time.|sd
Right.|b
And it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital,|sd
Right.|b
the, the deductibles didn't apply.|sd
Right.|b
And so that's one way, one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by, uh, -|sv
okay,|^q
if you'll shorten your stay then we will, uh, waive the deductible.|^q
Right.|aa
Our, our insurance is, uh, is doing something similar where they're also going to mor-, -|sd
So what movies have you seen lately?|qw
Well, I saw, um, lately I've seen SOAP DISH.|sd
Oh.|bk
Which was a, -|%
and that was a lot of fun.|sd
It was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things.|sd
Well, see that's something I want to see,|sd
Yeah.|%
that's on my list to see.|sd
Yeah,|b
it was, it was okay.|sd
It was not, um, not a wonderful film|sd
but it was, I mean it was, it was cute but not the biggest laugh I've seen.|sd
Oh, okay.|b
I saw THELMA AND LOUISE.|sd
Oh, did you?|bh
Actually I saw it twice because I liked it so much.|sd
Oh.|b
See that's also on my list.|sd
And it's very, it's really disturbing but a good movie.|sd
A disturbing movie,|b^m
how do you mean?|qo
Well, it was, -|%
um, let's see.|^h
The, um, -|%
it's, it's different,|sd
it's kind of, it's an action adventure kind of, you know, shoot 'em up kind of film.|sd
Right.|b
But it's with women in it instead of men|sd
so that's kind of a --|sv
A switcheroo, huh?|bh
And it made me think a lot about, you know, -|sd
you would applaud Bruce Willis in DIE HARD if he was doing this|sv
but you might not be so --|sv
Right.|b
When the shoe is on the other foot and see how it, -|sv
So, that was kind of interesting.|sd
I've, -|%
but I really enjoyed it.|sd
Oh.|b
So, I w-, -|%
Because that, that just reminds me of, you know, like back in school|sd
and, you know, the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's kind of what it was.|aa
but, -|%
Right.|b
um, yeah.|b
They had started out with that,|sd
then they got into lots of trouble.|sd
Before we found the shopping malls that's what we did.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
well, I'll have to put that, I'll have to keep that on my list then.|sd
Yeah.|b
I also saw that Madonna movie.|sd
Oh.|b
It's TRUTH OR DARE|sd
and that was pretty scandalous.|sd
Scandalous?|b^m
Yeah,|ny
it was kind of, -|sd
yeah,|%
Madonna --|sv
I can imagine.|ba
And so it was, it was interesting|sd
I guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is, huh?|sv
Righ-,|b
well, I think she kept saying that, uh,|sd
they talked about her,|sd
it, it was a film of her concert, um, tour she had taken through all, all around the world.|sd
And they were all to her at the Vatican city and wouldn't let her perform in Rome,|sd
and she,|sd
Huh.|b
It had a social message to it|sd
and, -|%
You just had to find it.|sv
You had to wade through it and find it|sv
Right.|aa
We never quite believed that,|sd
so. -|%
You never quite got to,|sv
I thought that was pushing it a little bit|sv
but, she , -|%
All I know about that woman is that she's an in-, incredible marketeer|sv
She is.|aa
She's rich|sv
Yeah,|aa
and she's rich|aa
and she, -|%
yeah,|%
so. -|%
she's smart at what she does.|sv
She knows how to do that.|sv
She knows how to twist this around, huh?|qy
Yeah.|ny
What did you think about DANCES WITH WOLVES when you saw it?|qo
Well, okay,|b
see, we're getting back to last year.|sd
That's probably the last movie I saw. Um, DANCES WITH WOLVES,|sd
I just adored it.|sd
Really?|bh
How can I tell you.|^h
Um, a couple years ago, I guess, well, maybe ten years ago I, I had read BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean I really liked it a lot.|sd
Right.|b
I mean it was a real consciousness raiser, I guess.|sv
Um, and I only bring up WOUNDED KNEE because that was what ten years ago you read and, and understood, you know, about the American pop, Indian population,|sv
Right.|b
and then everything went away for a couple years,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and now it's back again.|sv
And, you know, it's sort of a popular view of, um, what happened way back then.|sv
Right.|b
Of course, no one will ever know.|sv
Really I don't kn-, -|h
I know,|aa
I was,|%
I wondered if, uh, the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the, the evil tribe, if they were really as bad as it made them to be.|qh
Well, who knows.|no
I mean it, it, it sort of showed like two different types of tribes|sd
like one was a warring tribe,|sd
and the other one was, uh, vegetarian kind of, you know, feel good tribe.|sd
Right|b
so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Nobody can get along peacefully|sv
Yeah,|aa
but I wonder|%
I thought the-, -|%
because they made a big deal about how this, this film was such a big leap for the, the people who, who were the ancestors of the, this Indian tribe|sv
and that, you know, that was so wonderful that they done that|sv
and they, uh, uh, I wonder how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film, -|qh
Oh, I see.|b
if it, -|%
you know, you didn't,|sv
Yeah.|b
Huh.|b
I thought it was a very interesting movie.|sv
Well, I think so.|aa
I, um, I have come to respect a little bit more the, uh, you know, what went on here,|sd
Right.|b
but, but who knows how it's supposed to all end|qh
Uh-huh|aa
Right.|aa
You know on the, on the broad scope I mean, um, like if, uh, it, it, it had a much bigger thing I thin-, -|sv
meaning to me -|%
I think about, you know, just the meaning of, um, the freedom of this country and, and what that really meant.|sv
Right.|b
And that was taking over somebody else's freedoms.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, so you know it, it meant something bigger I think.|sv
But still it was a fantas-, -|sv
I loved the buffalo scene.|sd
And I thought Kevin Costner was just, -|sv
I got a little sick of his mug on the screen every,|sv
I know the -|aa
but he's the director, you know.|sd
Um, but, yeah,|%
I, I just thought it was a really interesting, intense film.|sv
Well, that's good.|ba
Intense I think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast.|sv
That was, that was, it was, it was good.|ba
I looked at my watch only a few times,|sd
Yeah.|b
Ate a lot of popcorn.|sd
But it put me in a really, it put me in a really bad mood,|sd
I don't know why.|sd
Did it really?|bh
Yeah,|ny
we di-, -|%
there were three of us who went.|sd
We were just all grou-, really grouchy when it was over.|sd
Huh.|b
So we decided that may be the mark of a good film.|sd

my mother's side of the family is quite large, or well, was quite large at one time,|sd

Uh-huh.|b
And, -|%
All local.|qy^d
Were they like all in Dallas?|qy
Uh, no, no not, no,|nn
this was, well, I am actually from Mississippi,|sd

Oh.|bk
it, it was around there generally.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Uh, that's where the family --|sd
Just from city to city then .|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
and it was not only in Mississippi, in some other places,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
so. It was, uh, it was a big deal,|sd
but, uh, they tried to, to centralize it in one spot.|sd
So, in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
We rent a pavilion and, and do that|sd
and that's usually works out to be pretty good.|sd
And, uh, they will rent a pavilion on a weekend,|sd

Do you go back?|qy
I have not gone back lately.|ng
In fact, uh, this past Sunday was the, was the reunion,|sd

Not getting to go.|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Uh, just, uh, the distance involved|sd

Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
uh, just not, -|%
I have a younger daughter now|sd
and, uh, I, -|%
it's kind of hard to get her, get her there,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But I am going to, to, uh, hopefully next year get to go back, cause, uh, a lot of the family has not, uh, on her side, my mother's side, has not seen, you know, my daughter,|sd
so -|%
Oh.|b
Do you have brothers and sisters?|qy
I have one brother,|sd
so. -|%
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And, is your mother still living?|qy
Yes.|ny
Oh, so, so you go back and visit with her anyway.|qy^d
Would you not?|^g
Right,|na
yeah.|na
I mean, either way there was family reunion time,|qy
Right, I, I usually see her a,|na
so that's no, no big thing.|sd
But, uh, I, uh, I do, I do enjoy the reunions.|sd
The only problem is that now, uh, originally when we had them, uh, they were mainly my mother's|sd
Relatives,|^2
right.|%
uh, father's.|sd
My mother's father's family had quite a few,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, it was a large reunion of, of, of that group, uh, from that descendants.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, a lot of those people have, -|sd
and at time, you know, they all knew one another.|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
And now it has gotten, uh, that, uh, a lot of those people are d-, have, uh, have died off,|sd
or, you know, what we are left with is the, the relatives of, of,|sd
The next generation,|^2
uh-huh.|%
And so, uh, it's not quite as close as it used to be.|sd
So, I think people feel less of a desire to really go.|sd
I know that, -|%
Wh-, why do you think that it's less close than it used to be?|qo
Well, I, I just think that, uh, you know, at that ti-, -|%
when, when they were a-, -|%
you know, the, those were all brothers and sisters a lot -|sd
and or they were all in the same ar-, geographical location.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together,|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
Right.|b
And as, as time grew, I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth.|sd
And now when they come together it's, it's generally, you know, -|sd
like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the, the closeness that they used to be there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but that's just how it is.|sd
My mother was complaining last year about th-, you know, -|sd
it's dwindling down every year,|sd
you know, that's just, I think --|%
Is that just family's lack of priority, anymore, maybe yes ,|qy
we get so involved in our work lives and just,|sv
Well, yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
that's, uh, -|%
yeah,|%
I think that's some of it.|aa
But, you know, I have, -|%
uh, I, I, -|%
it's just the way, you know, I think society is now, is that we are not, we do not have the extensive family we used to.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It's more of a, you know, a smaller, smaller unit,|sv
and you know, we, we tend to try to do things, I think with our immediate family,|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
Uh -|%
It really makes an effort on, to,|sv
Right,|b
it requires a lot of effort to, to,|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
I mean, I, I used to enjoy going,|sd
I mean I still do kind of enjoy it,|sd
but, uh, it's, it does not, it's not as many people there that I really, really enjoy seeing.|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
You know, I, -|%
it's going just for the sake of getting together,|sd
I think for the family.|sd
And, -|%
Do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group?|qy
Uh,|^h
Um, um, no,|nn
not really.|sd
Tha-, in that, -|%
but, then again, uh, well, I, you know, I have some aunts that, uh, I, I, I do.|sd
That's about th-, -|%
my mother's sisters,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
but I feel closer to them, because I kind of grew up with them.|sd
But,|sd
Right.|b
Uh, you know, and, and generally when I was growing up a lot of those people, the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion,|sd
so, uh -- -|%
Right,|b
right.|b
-- you do not really feel that that really close to them.|sd
Right.|aa
In my, my, uh, father's family, we get together every year at a different location, either Dallas or Oklahoma City.|sd
They had chosen Santa Barbara, California for this summer and, and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, so they cancelled that one and, uh, are looking next year bringing it back closer,|sd
but we have a letter, a family letter,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it usually goes through me twice a year|sd
and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the, your new letter on the top,|sd
and then that's the way it's kept in order.|sd
And then, about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion, you do not feel like, I do not know anything about this person.|sd
You have,|sd
That's a good idea.|ba
So, you are kind of,|sd
Right.|b
And that,|sd
Yeah.|ny
Right.|b
We tried to start that in my husband's family.|sd
His mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago,|sd
and I said, well let's start this letter,|sd
and it just never -|sd
my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us|sd
and that's as far as it got.|sd
I sent it,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in Scottsdale, Arizona,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We are real glad we got together because since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left.|sd
And the sister-in-law died|sd
and the sister is in a nursing home,|sd
so, we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago.|sd

I have that, too.|sd
I'm forty-two,|sd
I need something,|sd
I need more.|sd

I, I said I do like to ski.|sd

So just, you know, -|%
don't, don't be in any hurry.|ad
I'm not, I'm not.|aa
You really should go to Europe.|ad
I went to Europe for six weeks after I graduated from college|sd

I, I mean I could have had that or a down payment on a new car|sd

Uh, six weeks.|sd

It was wonderful,|sd
so you should think about doing something like that.|ad
Uh-huh,|aa
I just had a friend that got back from Europe|sd
and she was there like all winter semester.|sd
We're supposed to talk about crime in the city.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays, doesn't it?|qy
Well, uh, I, -|%
that's, -|%
sure.|na
Uh, I, I think it's -|%
s-, st-, statistics, obviously, vary greatly.|sv
I always thought of Dallas as being a fairly safe place.|sv
Well, it is,|aa
but our crimes up here, uh, as I think it must be in most cities now,|sv
but, uh, I was listening to the news the other day|sd
and they said they thought a lot of it, the reason it was up so was because of the, uh, so many people are without work nowadays,|sd
economy's so bad|sd
Do you really believe that?|qy
I mean, it, it's been up every year for many years|sv
and the economy hasn't been,|qy
That's a good point|ba
That's just what they quoted over the news.|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't know if I believe that or not,|no
but, it, it does seem up|sv
and, -|%
What kind of newspaper do you get down there?|qw
What kind?|qw
Yeah.|ny
Well, we got a, I think we got a pretty good newspaper.|sd
Uh, we have two, the MORNING NEWS and the, uh, TIMES HERALD.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
MORNING NEWS seems to have the largest circulation.|sd
I think it's a pretty good, -|sd
it's a locally owned paper.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
The HERALD is owned, I think, by the TIMES out of, uh, L A, or somewhere.|sd
Yes.|b
But, -|%
D-, do they, do they play up the local crime angles|qy
or d-, or do they, -|%
Well, they don't,|ng
no,|nn
not really, uh,|sd
they don't play it up, I don't think.|sd
Uh, but there, there is too much of it, you know, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
We had our, our, fact about, uh, -|%
last year sometime our home was broken into.|sd
Really?|bh
We, -|%
So this is a topic of personal interest.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
we, uh, uh, -|%
I didn't think ours ever would be burgled into, burgled,|sd
but, so many in our neighborhood had been,|sd
and, uh, because we live on a corner --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
But, uh, we were, so, uh, -|%
So, so you saw this happening in your neighborhood|bf
and you figured it wouldn't happen to you.|bf
Sort of, yeah.|aa
And I never did get a security system,|sd
but since that happened, I certainly have.|sd
Yeah,|b
what kind of system do you have?|qw
It's, uh, uh, I guess excuse me, just a standard. Uh, with the, uh, all the doors and the, uh, infrared thing, you know, motion detector.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Pre-,|sd
Is,|qy
Yes,|ny
yes.|ny
It's monitored and all that.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, -|%
Well, is that a necessary feature to have somebody, you know, at the other end of the line|qy
or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise?|qrr
I think, uh, the thing that makes a lot of noise would, would suffice.|sv
Yeah.|b
I really do.|sv
But, uh, this deal that was part of it for, you know, three years or so --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, but it, uh, -|%
the monitoring is not that bad, though|sd
because, uh, uh, we've goofed it up, you know,|sd
several times you'll hit the wrong key, not intentionally or something|sd
and and they call back pretty quickly,|sd
so I guess it's, you know, I think it's all right.|sd
But I, -|%
to answer your question, I think, uh --|sv
Yeah.|b
whether it, -|%
S-, s-, so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system|qy^d
Uh-huh.|qy
And what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line?|qw
Well, it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly. Tha-, uh, that if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway Supposedly.|sd
How does it do that?|qw
Who knows, you know.|no
But that's a selling point.|sv
And I think they're probably, I think it probably does these things or sur-, supposedly pretty good.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Boy, they sure advertise them, you know, so many of them nowadays.|sv
Sure.|aa
But, uh, well don't, don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there?|qy
Well, yeah, uh,|ny
I'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's.|sd
Down here, we seem to, -|sd
or, or not here, -|%
but the statistics seem to say that.|sv
I don't know.|h
I, I think it's the murder capital of the country now.|sv
Is that right?|bh
Yes.|ny
I would gather probably from drugs.|sv
Absolutely.|aa
And I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, I don't think there's anyplace, -|sv
used to, -|%
years ago, you thought, well, these little small cities and all, wouldn't have that problem,|sv
but they do.|sv
Yeah.|b
We've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it, uh, as anyone, you know.|sd
S-, s-, so, what's the solution?|qh
That's a good question.|ba
I don't know,|no
I don't know what the solution is.|no
I really don't.|no
And all these politicians make, make hay over, you know --|sv
Yeah.|b
but --|sv
Yep.|b
Th-, -|%

so, -|%
Yeah.|b
Supply and demand.|sv
Long as somebody wants to buy it, somebody going to provide it for them|sv
So, I don't know, I don't got, you know, I don't know what the solution is,|sd
I really don't|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't think anyone does, in fact.|sv
Yeah,|b
what, -|%
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
well, do you have a pet?|qy

Well, my husband, -|%
you know, how, sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing.|sv
Oh, no.|b
My husband is a hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman, Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog.|sd
So we have a black Labrador.|sd
Ooh.|bk
Beautiful, gorgeous black Labrador,|sd
but to me, he belongs up in the field, you know, in the --|sd
and, -|%
Well, because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind, uh, he sleeps in the laundry room|arp_nd
and then he goes out for the day.|sd
But this, this is a beautiful dog|sd
and he is wonderful with our little girls|sd
and he is, he's, comes from a purebred line|sd
and there's nothing you could say bad about him, except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person --|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
And this is huge.|sd
You know, course, when he runs around the yard, he just digs,|sd
he doesn't know that he's tearing up things,|sd
but he does.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
And the worst part that I had with him, he's, he's three now --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one,|sd
and I left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour.|sd
And I came home|sd
and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall.|sd
Oh, my word.|ba
And it was in the floor|sd
and I just about lost it|sd
and I called|sd
and I said, come home and get your dog.|sd
And so, he said, well, puppies just chew when they're nervous and I, well, I wish you had told me --|sd
Oh, dear.|ba
and it was about eight months later, he ate a piece of the linoleum.|sd
He kept picking at it|sd
and I didn't kn-, -|sd
the, the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it -|sd
So the last thing he did was, when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard, and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch.|sd
And I told my husband,|sd
I said, you know, it's either me or the dog,|sd
and he looked at me like, well, you know -|sd
Good-bye|^2
He loves this dog|sd
and every night when he comes home from work, he hugs it and talks to him|sd
and he's a good dog,|sd
so it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to|sd
and that's why I laughed when they called with the topic.|sd
I thought, oh, boy, do I have a pet|sd
But, I, I grew up with cats|sd
and I'm very comfortable, -|sd
I love my cats.|sd
Yeah.|b
I had one cat for eighteen years.|sd
I got her when I lived in Hawaii.|sd

Oh, no|ba
Oh, it was just bad.|sd
And my closet -|%

Oh, that's awful,|ba
I never heard of that before.|sv
Oh, it was terrible.|sd
And once she did it, you know, then she would, I mean, she wouldn't, -|sd
if our shoes sat side by side, she would pee in my husband's shoes.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
She must have known he didn't like her or something.|sv
Or the smell or something.|sv
Oh, anyway, I, I, -|%
and I would shut, I would bar the closet doors,|sd

Uh-huh.|bd

Oh, no, I --|sd
See. -|b
We've had two dogs|sd

Oh, no.|ba

Um.|b
-- and people are doing their fires|sd
and I brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there|sd

And how old are your girls?|qw
They're eleven and eight|sd

Oh, okay.|b
I, I hate to cut it off,|sd
I think --|sd
I understand.|ba
so we'll just wait.|ad
Okay,|aa
well -- -|%
Whoever it is will call back.|sv

Well, it's somebody calling for my kids, you know,|sd
jeez.|ba
Yeah,|aa
I know.|aa
Actually, it's my son,|sd
I know it is.|sd
My older boy. He never likes to come home from school.|sd

Salt water or, -|qy^d
No --|nn
Yeah.|b
-- just regular water.|sd
Yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago.|sd
Well, they've, uh, statewide raises,|sd
they raise ours it seems like constantly.|sd
We just, uh, passed a new one, uh,|sd
fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines.|sd
Oh, right|b
Indianapolis got that, didn't they?|qy
Right.|na
And, uh, we had passed a, a provisional one that if, if it did, if they did locate here we would raise our taxes.|sd
But, uh, at least we thought we'd get something back from that.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, how do you feel about taxes?|qo
Well, it seems like a big politics game|sv
like up here, last year, the governor was up for re-election|sd
so he said the budget was fine,|sd
the state didn't have any money|sd
and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money|sd
so they raised all our taxes.|sd
And now it's election time again|sd
so they're trying to lower them.|sd
Oh.|b
So they're just talk about lowering them|sd
but they never do,|sd
they just keep raising them.|sd
I've never seen taxes really go down.|sd
Yeah,|b
me neither.|sd
Well, actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long|sd
so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year|sd
and they're going to lower it for next year.|sd
Oh.|b
I guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget.|sv
I hope they put that in writing|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
they say they're going to lower,|sd
but I'll see.|sd
I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and, uh, that the rich are not paying their share|sv
and of course the poor can't afford it either,|sv
but, uh, I really feel like -|%
and, and I feel like, you know, -|%
I'm a middle class person income wise anyway|sd
and, uh, I get tired of supporting the whole country.|sd
Yeah,|b
so do I.|sd
I mean, I'm a, a middle class barely,|sd
but, uh, I don't think the rich are paying mo-, less, not enough,|sv
I think they're paying too much.|sv
You think the rich are paying too much?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I mean if you're in the, the three, three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month, well, that's ridiculous.|sv
Why bother working?|qh
Well, I don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to, -|sd
I mean, I'm talking about the really rich.|sd
Well, they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make.|sv
Right.|b
That would be fair.|sv
Now I'll go along with that.|aa
Yeah --|b
-- no loopholes or anything.|sv
Everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever.|sv
Right.|aa
Now, I think that would be fair.|aa
Right.|b
And I, you know, -|%
no, no ifs, ands and buts, you know,|sv
no big elaborate laws that say, uh, you know, call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review.|sv
It's just, you know, you make this, you pay ten percent.|sv
If you make a hundred dollars, you pay ten percent,|sv
if you make a million dollars, you pay ten percent.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's the way our state tax is here.|sd
I think it's pretty fair.|sv
Our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate.|sd
Oh|b
So, and, and you withhold no matter what you do,|sd
they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough.|sd
Oh, great,|ba
so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out.|sv
Right,|aa
so now, you know, when you sign your W-Four form or whatever, W-Two --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it's been that way for the last probably ten years.|sd
Yeah,|b
I guess you have to check yes|sv
or you come down to the end of the year|sv
and you don't have it to give it to them.|sv
Right,|aa
unless you have a lot of deductions.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, you know, if you have a lot of federal deduction, it ends up hurting you state wise.|sv
Really?|bh
And you end up owing, you know,|sv
you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal|sv
and you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state.|sv
Ouch|ba
And, uh, it's, it's just ridiculous.|sv
But, I, I don't know.|h
I've, -|%
they just came up with a twenty-five percent increase on personal property in, in Oklahoma county and that is a chunk.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I'll say|ba
I mean twenty-five percent increase.|sd
Y-, -|%
is, -|%
Uh, I guess, uh, I've always been kind of interested in, in, space and stuff.|sd
I've,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Have you been following the, uh, the progress of the space health code ?|qy
Uh, to a degree.|na
I haven't kept up as, uh, much as I would like,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I've just been so busy, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then,|sd
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
I think it's pretty exciting that they can, uh, -|sv
it would be interesting to see if they can find, uh, other planets that are, that will be more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans|sv
and, uh, yeah,|%
I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if, uh, if it, you know, if it is at all possible.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, I wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one,|sd
or right now -|%
but I'm probably getting a little too old for that.|sv
Well, I know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore.|sv
Right.|aa
Yeah.|aa
Well, they, they just made leaps and jumps.|sv
I think a lot of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, uh, uh, equipment and stuff that, -|sv
Yeah,|aa
I agree. Uh,|aa
as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to, to, you know, to visit the, uh, space center out there,|sd
and, uh, one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, that vacuum , uh, little space program was one of the big, you know, backers of that.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's amazing, you know,|sv
you, -|%
it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now.|sv
Yeah.|b
I don't know if you ever watch Gallagher , you know,|qy^d
he's one of the comedians|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh,|ny
yeah,|ny
I've h-, seen him before.|sd
Wh-, i-, what would we do without it?|qh
Yeah.|b
Yo-, we were talking about that just the other day.|sd
What did we do without it back then?|qh
Yeah.|b
I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that have come up .|sv
I know maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh, -|%
concentrated foods for one maybe|sd
I don-,|h
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
it's also just I've, I've often pictured, uh, in my mind, you know, what it would be like to just, what would you find if you just kept on going, kept on going?|qh
Uh-huh.|aa
That's true.|aa
Uh, I guess our minds are so, uh, uh, what is it? Uh, finite --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
I always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually.|sd
It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that, that is, uh, that is something that would be hard to think about.|aa
I agree.|aa
You know like you say we're used to finite things|aa
and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible. -|sv
Yeah.|aa
But, -|%
But, uh, yeah,|b
I would like to see them, uh, do more in that area to make space travel more, uh, something that the ordinary person can, uh, en-, enjoy.|sd
Yeah.|aa
I know it's I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And I, I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, you know, -|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
me too.|sd
I wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore.|sd
Yeah.|b
I think, uh, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't,|sv
Huh.|b
I think that's what made us, uh, progress to the state we are is our curiosity.|sv
Oh, sure.|aa
Sure.|aa
Of course.|aa
That's true.|aa
There must be some better so-, better way of doing this.|sv
A better place to be or whatever, you know|sv
it's, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
So you, you are always looking for something better.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
I know at work, uh, people always complain to me|sd
I, well, you are always whining|sd
and,|sd
Yeah|b
There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it.|sv
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
And if you are just content with being, you know, with the way things are then, you know, then you must lead, lead a pretty dull life.|sv
Yeah.|b
Because if yo-, -|%
Well, they are always finding easier ways|sv
and, you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that. -|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And they are doing it un-, you know, unconsciously.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I guess, uh, you don't really think about it too much.|sv
I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff|sv
but yo-, -|%
it, it's in a subconscious, you know, thing.|sv
You know, somewhere they can sit down and write down what, you know, things that you've improved upon,|sv
you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But you just don't think about them.|sv
Right.|b
And that's true.|aa
I think, uh, you know, -|%
we've gotten different programs at work, you know, to, to, uh, make it visible to management that we are doing things better,|sd
So, how do you feel about capital punishment?|qo
Well, I, I'm not really certain how I, uh, I'm not certain that, that it does a lot of good. I mean, that it ends up, ends up effectively, uh, uh, uh, avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment --|sd
Right,|b
you don't think, -|%
Yet, on the other hand, uh, I don't know,|h
I mean, there is things that -|%
seems like it's, it's, it's the right thing to do.|sv
Now, you know, I mean somebody, a s-, s-, serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns, you know, fifty, fifty children in a school yard,|sv
you kind of, -|%
I don't know.|h
What about yourself?|qo
I, uh, I have the same dilemma, I think. Uh,|sd
it's, you know, it seems right sometimes|sv
and then other times, you don't know.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh,|b
I mean, people, like, -|%
I, -|%
it's been, -|%
I mean, like the Arab societies and stuff end up, uh, having e-, effective, effective punishments|sv
and, and they're extremely severe.|sv
Uh, I, you know, I think to a certain degree, the reason that it, it doesn't serve as a deterrent, uh, may be because y-, you never know if it's going to be a-, applied. Right,|sv
un-, unlike, uh, like in, in Arab societies. If you get, get caught stealing, they chop off your hand|sv
and --|sv
Right.|b
and everybody knows exactly what, what for.|sv
Right.|b
Uh, and, you know, and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact, -|sv
or, or there is a good chance you're going to get off.|sv
Uh-huh.|aa
And also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm,|sv
I mean, sure, their life is taken,|sv
but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway,|sv
so --|sv
so it's more of the easy way out than --|sv
some people, -|%
Yeah.|b
Except that, I mean, the, the average cost to si-, to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is extremely high. I mean, something, I, I was amazed at. Uh, uh, per year,|sv
it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, you know, and it's sort of a sort of a crass perspective --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but on the other hand, uh, uh, you know, I don't, I don't know if it's that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, uh ...|sd
Right,|aa
but then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway,|sd
so --|%
Uh-huh|b
it doesn't, -|%
it seems by, that by, -|%
I don't know,|h
doesn't ever really, p-, uh ... -|%
Oh, I know,|aa
I mean, you can't, -|%
it doesn't,|sv

It doesn't bring back every, -|aa

What state are you in?|qw
I'm in Texas.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
W-, w-, -|%
In Dallas?|qy
No,|nn
I'm in Austin.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Where, where are you calling from?|qw
Uh, right now I'm in Utah,|sd
but I'm from Plano, Texas.|sd
Oh, I see,|bk
uh-huh.|%
So, uh, uh, what are the laws like in Texas?|qw
It's, Texas is, has, is one of the, one of the s-, well, -|%
I guess there is more and more states that are, that are going back to capital punishment.|sd
Uh, Texas has had it for a while.|sd
It's one of the quickest,|sd
it, it, -|%
once it was, it was reallowed, -|sd
I think it was outlawed for a while, but, uh, by the supreme court, I mean, or, the interpretation of the constitution|sd
and it seems like everybody stopped|sd
and then, and then once they sort of reallowed it, Texas was one of the first to, uh, to actually, uh, implement it again.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
They do it by, uh, by, do it by lethal injection.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I'm originally from Kansas|sd
and in Kansas also, uh, they, they almost immediately put back capital punishment|sd
and, uh, there they do it by hanging.|sd
Wow.|ba
Still, uh, they have, -|%
I still remember the, the, the movie, uh, IN COLD BLOOD.|sd
I don't know if you've ever, -|qy^d
I'm sure you're familiar with it,|qy^d
but, have you seen the movie?|qy
I haven't,|ng
no.|nn
Yeah.|b
That way.|sd
And they do it that way?|qy
Yeah,|ny
well, they, they show it,|sd
not, not, -|%
I mean, the, the movie was made in, like, nineteen sixty-two or something like that --|sd
Huh.|b
-- and so it's, uh, it's not particularly graphic,|sd
but on the other hand it's, it's fairly impressive to watch them, you know, walk into the room with gallows.|sd
It's kind of a barn like structure.|sd
Wow.|ba
I think they're there,|sd
I think that capital punishment is, is, uh, in t-, in Utah also.|sd
I'm not really familiar.|sd
Is that right?|bh
Are you there in school?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I am.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, but I think they d-, -|%
a long time ago, I, I remember my dad was telling me this, I think, that, uh, they do it by, like, a bunch of men have guns|sd
and one of them has the real gun in it.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
has, has a, -|%
yeah.|%
So they don't know who killed, -|sd
Has a real bullets -|qy^d
and the rest of them have blanks?|qy^d
Right.|na
Yeah,|b
I, I certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner,|sd
I know that|aa
Yeah,|b
no.|aa
I've always said that if I, if I had to kill and clean and do my own, my own meat, I think I'd become a vegetarian.|sd
I know.|aa
As long as you're sort of safely removed from it, it seems, seems not so, so bad, I guess.|sv
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
All right.|b
Go ahead.|ad
Well, what kind of car would I want to buy.|qw^d
Yeah.|ny
I don't know.|no
The question is, I mean, would I want to buy,|sd
or would I, would I probably actually buy. -|sd
May be two different things.|sv
Oh, well, if you, if you had all your, all the money in the world or something. -|qw^d
If I had all the money I wanted, then that's whole different matter.|sv
No,|b
in that case, I'd, I'd, I don't know.|no
I, I, my dream car for years was a, was a Porsche --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, I don't know if I'd want one of those now.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Of course I would want one if somebody was --|sd
Yeah.|b
But I maybe would buy a B M W.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
What do you have now?|qw
I've got a, uh, a Dodge Daytona.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's actually the first car we ever bought new.|sd
Oh, really.|b
Yeah,|b
we just, we, well, I have -|%
my car is the first one we ever bought new, too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But we just bought another used car, a couple weeks ago, actually.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah|b
me too|sd
So what car do you drive?|qw
What is it?|qw
Uh, mine is a Honda Accord.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
we almost bought one of those.|sd
Do you like it?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I do,|sd
and, and, um, it's funny because, after I bought it, I was doing a lot of business traveling,|sd
and I, -|%
some of the cars that I got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, um, I don't like them as well except, it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics,|sd
and mine is a standard --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- it had a lot more pickup and everything.|sd
Yeah,|aa
you get a little more control over when --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|%
Uh, what, what rental agent did you go to to actually rent --|qw
Um --|b
-- usually AVIS.|sd
To what, AVIS?|br
AVIS.|na
Really.|bh
Yeah.|ny
Huh.|b
I guess, -|%
It's just because we're on, -|sd
I think of it, -|%
I'm not sure those are AVIS or not,|sd
but we have corporate contracts --|sd
I see.|bk
Uh-huh.|b
-- so it depends on your destination, too.|sd
Right.|b
Kind of strange|sd
You work for a big company, then.|qy^d
Work for T I.|no
T I, I see.|bk
Uh-huh. Um,|b
but yeah,|b
I, I, uh, I don't know,|h
I would probably, if I were to buy a car mys-, you know, with the constraints of real money --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Maybe it would, -|%
one thing I, I really liked about, about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have, uh, this seven year warranty.|sv
Oh, really.|b
Um, and it really saved us some big money once.|sd
It did, huh.|bh
Yeah,|ny
they had a whole bunch of things that, that sort of broke at the same time --|sd
Oh, my gosh.|ba
-- and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars,|sd
and I had to pay twenty five for the, -|sd
Oh, that was great.|ba
Yeah,|aa
it was.|aa
That's unusual to hear,|sv
usually, you know something breaks,|sv
you look at the warranty|sv
and it's excluded.|sv
Well, we, we bought the extended, the the extension --|sd
Oh, I see,|b
okay.|b
Oh, you got your money's worth.|sv
Yeah,|aa
we did,|aa
but, you know, we really debated at the beginning,|sd
and --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
that is good.|ba
But, um, we still have, we still have like, you know, coup-, three years left on it.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, I've been lucky.|sd
Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it --|sd
Oh, no.|ba
-- but I was real lucky because it just hit the, um --|sd
Bumper?|qy
Oh.|bk
It didn't actually dent the car or anything.|sd
So it cost me twenty-five bucks to replace --|sd
Well, that was good.|ba
and --|sd
Are you. -|%
so.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, if you were, if you were going to, uh, buy a new car would you buy another, uh, another Accord?|qy
Um, I probably wouldn't, just because I already have one --|ng
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, you know, if I had to make the choice again, I, yeah, I, I'm perfectly happy with what I decided --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and that's a Legend --|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
those are nice .|sv
-- um, but it's, it's a used one --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, um, my husband has really wanted one for a long time,|sd
and the fact that, you know, this c-, this car that I have has performed so well,|sd
and before that I also had an Accord,|sd
it was a real old one --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I bought that used.|sd
I had absolutely no money to my name and bought that,|sd
and it served me real well, too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars.|sd
Right.|b
And. -|%
Yeah,|b
my sister drives one.|sd
She drives a, uh, I don't know, is it Legend --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- it's a, -|%
I'm not certain,|sd
but she's liked it. Um,|sd
Yeah.|b
But, I, I have, I have never had,|sd
and we, -|%
in fact, what I'm driving right now, -|sd
we bought a, we only had one car for a long time,|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And so, uh, I bought a used Yugo --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
How did it go for you?|qw
Oh, well, it's, uh, it's worked.|sd
Hasn't left you stranded.|qy^d
I mean, that's exactly what it is, you know,|no
it's just a, it's a cheap little --|sd
Yeah|aa
I know.|aa
Yeah.|b
-- and, uh. It's actually kind of fun to drive.|sd
I, I, -|%
you know, getting back in the Daytona now, I almost don't like it. You know --|sd
Really.|b
-- it's like too, too mushy,|sd
and it, you know --|sd
Huh.|b
and -- -|%
Well, that's what my husband thinks about my car now, that he's had the Legend --|sd

the steering -- -|%

-- you know, you feel like you're in a boat or something, you know,|sd
it's kind of, -|%
I can't drive that,|sd
the Legend, it's just so huge.|sd
Oh.|b
I, I don't like it,|sd
and it's so, uh, -|%
do you have a P C?|qy
Yes,|ny
I have a Macintosh S E thirty.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
a lot of my friends are into Macintoshes.|sd
I have a, um, P C, a I B M P C myself.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
A two eighty-six.|sd
I'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six. Um.|sd
What do you use yours for mostly?|qw
Um, mostly, um, word processing applications and, uh, just as a dumb terminal.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, but I, um, I think eventually I'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that.|sd
Um, what do you find that you use yours mostly for?|qw
Well, I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base,|sd
and, uh, about the only thing -|%
I am, uh, I'm just starting to get into, uh, a little bit more communications now.|sd
I've just today ordered a fax modem|sd
so I'll be able to --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
you don't have to make a hard copy that way.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, are you using windows?|qy
No,|nn
I, I think I, I'm planning on like moving up, getting a three eighty-six before I move up to windows --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well, it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh|sv
Yeah,|aa
it's, um, -|%
I want, I want to be able I just want it more for multi tasking, which I suppose is also like a Macintosh.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh.|b
Well, the one thing I used to use a, uh, -|sd
I've never used an I B M actually.|sd
I used to use a, just an Apple two E, which of course is --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|aa
that's what I learned a lot of languages on, was an Apple two E in my high school.|sd
But I don't have any, uh, any real programming capabilities on my, uh, Mac right now.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't have, uh, any compilers --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so I'm, uh. -|%
Well, do you use your computer for, um, just things around the house, or in the . -|qy
I use it in my business.|sd
Well, see, what do you do?|qw
I, uh, do, uh, consultation and, and testing of various kinds for, uh, English as a second language programs.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
Um, and, uh, are these like, uh, do these programs, um, -|%
are, are they based on, on a, on a, um, other language,|qy
or are they based, are they based -|%
like a lot of the, um, you know, a lot of the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of, you know, parts of the world,|sv
and the teacher just tries to, tries to teach English, you know, through natural understanding.|sv
That's, uh, exactly what, yeah, that's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You seem to be, uh, better informed than the average person on that.|sv
Well, it was just, uh, when I was high school, I worked for the community school,|sd
and they had a English second language class|sd
and it always seemed strange to me that, you know, all these, all these people that, you know, spoke English not too well, and spoke, you know, a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to, you know, you don't have as many cues,|sv
you can't, don't have hand gestures and things like that.|sv
Right.|aa
Well, now, we, uh, -|%
what I use a computer for is to write materials that --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Most of the stuff that I do is not, uh, interactive --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I use it for t-, uh, data analysis on testing,|sd
so. -|%
Uh, to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that.|qy^d
Well, just, actually, just, uh, item analysis, statistical analysis of the tests, uh.|arp_nd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort.|sd
So it's, involves a lot of spreadsheet use.|sd
Yeah,|b
I would imagine so.|ba
Um, so, um, what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E?|qw
Well, I was doing some of the same stuff, but doing it more slowly|sd
I can't believe, you know, I've got, uh, five, uh, megabytes on this one now --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It, it's . -|%
-- and on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K|sd
Yes,|aa
it's amazing, you know, how, how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much.|sv
I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and you know, then, then we, then I started playing with Apples, you know,|sd
and those had forty-eight,|sd
or, you know, if they were really great --|sd
Oh, the old --|qy
Uh, I know,|sd
and -- -|%
My goodness.|ba
-- there's, I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K|sd
and there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time.|sd
Uh-huh|b
And you know it's just so amazing that generally, you know, if you, if you, -|%
I'm not sure about Macintoshes,|sd
but I know I B M -s, you, you generally, you know, you buy a megabyte at a time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, that's, that's your low-, that's the low end. Uh.|sd
Well the S P thirty goes up to eight --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet.|sd
I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and, and get another, possibly another hard disk.|sd
I don't know.|h
They say that system seven uses a lot of memory.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
I imagine .|ba
Okay, Bill,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
right?|qy
Yes.|ny
Okay, Bill,|bk
have you done much camping?|qy
Uh, yes.|ny
I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I camp, uh, every month, uh, camp at least one weekend|sd
and during the summer we camp, uh, two or three weeks a year|sd
Oh, well, that, that sounds good.|ba
I'd say I camp quite a bit.|sv
Yeah,|aa
you do.|aa
Um, now do you have a lot mountains,|qy
well, you don't have mountains in Texas, do you.|qy
Where do you find places to camp?|qw
Well, uh, we, we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping --|sd
Oh.|bk
-- and we, uh, we also, uh, carry all our equipment with us --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so we canoe down the river and then,|sd
Oh.|bk
Oh, my word.|ba
Well that sounds adventuresome|ba
How about yourself?|qo
Well, um, I've done, oh, I would say quite a bit of camping, mostly with my husband and I.|sd
Um, we have five children,|sd
and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves.|sd
So we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out,|sd
and we have gone up into the mountains and, uh, not necessarily roughed it,|sd
but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains.|sd
Well, that's good.|ba
And, then the boys are, our boys are old enough now,|sd
they're twelve and eleven,|sd
and so, they're involved in the scouting|sd
and they do a lot of camping with the scouts --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week,|sd
and so this year they'll both be going,|sd
and so that's been real enjoyable for them.|sd
Great.|ba
So. -|%
What, uh, what kind of camping do they like best?|qw
Do they like it where they have tents|qy
and, uh, do they cook on stoves?|qy
Um, yes,|ny
they've, well, -|%
no,|nn
actually they've, I remember, they have taken the, the du-, the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire,|sd
and I don't think they've taken the stoves.|sd
Um, last year they camped in tents,|sd
and this year I believe they will be in tents also.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah.|qy^d
Uh-huh,|ny
yeah.|ny
It doesn't get very cold in Texas,|sd
so lots of times we don't even take tents.|sd
Oh, is that right?|bh
We just use trail tarps.|sd
Oh, and what does that consist of?|qw
Uh, it's just a piece of material that has, uh, that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it --|sd
Oh.|bk
Uh-huh.|b
they're very light weight|sd
and we use them when we go backpacking.|sd
So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles, then, uh, -|sd
they're not very heavy, see --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so you carry them with you,|sd
and --|sd
Oh.|bk
Yes,|b
well, see, when, when we go camping here,|sd
we have to take our big huge, heavy sleeping bags, and lots of tents|sd
and, I like to sleep on the air matresses.|sd
I'm not, -|%
my bones are getting so old,|sd
so I like to, I like to sleep on the matresses.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, so, have you had any adventures on your camping trips, with, encounters with wild animals or anything like that?|qy
Ye-, yes,|ny
in fact, uh, um, last month we went camping,|sd
we saw a lot of deer --|sd
Oh.|bk
My word.|ba
Gee.|ba
Uh-huh,|b
so, uh, but, it, even though, uh, it wasn't hunting season, -|sd
and we were with Boy Scouts,|sd
so --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But we got to see a lot of deer --|sd
Oh.|bk
and there's, -|%
of course, we see smaller animals all the time,|sd
and, uh, one thing that is a big concern in the evening, at night, uh, is, uh, make sure that all the food's put away and so forth --|sd
Oh.|b
Do you know what --|qy
Oh.|b
Uh, they're covered like with a heavy armor --|na
Uh-huh.|b
uh-huh.|ny
And possums, and, uh, raccoons.|sd
My word.|ba
And we have those creatures down here that they like to, uh, they like to go hunting for a midnight snack.|sd
Uh-huh|b
And so that, that, uh, that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away.|sd
But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything.|qy
They will if you attack them.|sd
Oh.|bk
But most time they run away from you --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep.|sd
Oh, my word|ba
So. -|%
Well, that sounds a little less fierce than bears.|sv
We, we want to, -|%
Well, what d-, do you think in terms of, uh, benefits?|qo
Well, personally, you know, I think, you know, -|%
of course I'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package|sv
and I think that, uh, we've probably got one of the best around, you know,|sv
besides, they tend to offer ad-, adequate vacation, I guess.|sv
And the paid time off is wonderful,|sv
and, uh, one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered|sd
and I think that is just a, a fabulous one,|sv
so. I don't know if you participate in that or not,|qy^d
but -- -|%
Absolutely.|ny
-- isn't it great?|qy
It's just a, it's just a miracle that how fast that adds up, you know.|sv
Well, I have to agree with that.|aa
You know, I was thinking about, uh, importance of benefits and that kind of thing, other than salary --|sd
Uh-huh|b
Uh-huh.|b
And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed|sd
and I suspect that that's probably true for everyone.|sv
Yeah.|b
When I was much younger it was, uh, less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits.|sd
But as I grow older and my family grows, it, the medical benefits are more important|sd
and the retirement is more important.|sd
I had never really thought of it that way|ba
but I guess that's true, I guess that's true.|aa
I'm still young enough that, that, uh, the vacation's real important to me|sd
and the paid time off is real important to me and, and that kind of thing.|sd
But, uh, you know, I was just, as a matter of fact, I just, uh, celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and, uh, kind of started looking through the, the book because of that, you know,|sd
now that I'm a hundred percent vested, you know, you kind of look through the book and see well, what exactly, what does that mean and what is the pension all about|sd
and, you know, when you're, when you're, you know, in your, -|%
I'm only in my late twenties now,|sd
so you tend not to think about retirement.|sd
But, uh, it's, -|%
I guess now is the time to think about it,|sd
so. Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?|qy
I think they have, uh, a-, one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves.|na
Yeah.|b
And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, uh, CODA Plan.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I suppose if, b-, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan.|sv
Right.|b
But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So it's not, uh, -|%
all by itself it won't be adequate for,|sd
It's not going to build up,|sd
yeah.|aa
So, I have to find a way to supplement that.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, they just, they seem to make it so easy to save.|sv
You know, one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world, -|%
but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds, just coming straight out of my check.|sd
And it's probably not a great investment,|sv
but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know.|sd
I kind of have to trade off, you know.|sd
If you never see it you don't spend it,|sv
so And it's, -|%
I unders-, understand though,|ba
it, -|%
Yeah.|b
Uh, believe me, I do that myself.|sd
Do you?|bh
Yeah?|bh
And I disagree with you.|ar
I don't think it's the worst investment,|sd
Do you really not?|bh
I, I, fr-, you know, I, I debate about whether it's really good or not, you know.|sd
Well, it's, in terms of guaranteed return on investment -|%
and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Uh, it's shown a history that, uh, sure beats anything else.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
That's very true.|aa
We went, uh, and did a, a thing through I B S which is a, like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas|sd
and, uh, one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was, you know, -|sd
they work up this whole big, you know, proposal, profile for you, that, ev-, all the things that you need to work on and you need to do.|sd
And then one of the things that we talked about with her was, you know, the need to save for our son's education.|sd
We have a two year old, you know,|sd
and, and, you know, we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen, you know,|sd
we have to do that now.|sd
And, and uh, they have a way that they can figure, you know, what, you know, -|sd
and he's two now,|sd
in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college, this is how much it'll cost, you know,|sd
and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to, -|sd
it's, what it costs now is ridiculous,|sd
what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary.|sd
And they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a, oh, you know, six percent interest rate, to be able to have, you know, money for his college.|sd
And that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds, is, is, you know, about fifteen hundred dollars a year.|sd
So, I guess it, you know, -|%
in that way, at least we know that that's taken care of, you know.|sd
We, we can worry about other things|sd
so, -|%
I understand,|ba
Yeah.|b
That's,|sd
Yeah,|b
Is it really?|bh
Yeah.|b
Un-, except that mine are a little bit older|sd
and, and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available,|sd
all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there.|^q
Uh-huh.|b
You better make sure that you've got a scholarship.|^q
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
Well, that's what she said to us.|sd
She said, now, do you all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college?|sd
And, and our answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college.|sd
And if he wants to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, you know.|sd
And that was kind of our view on it.|sd
It just costs too much,|sv
you just can't do it, you know.|sv
So, I don't know,|h
it's, it's, -|%
I don't, uh, -|%
it just amazing,|%
it amazes me how much the, the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years.|sd
I just don't know how anybody's going to do it.|sv
And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them.|sd
Uh, I have a, an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be an allergist,|sd
Oh, goodness.|ba
and I said, that's wonderful.|sd
I applaud that.|^q
Let,|^q
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Exactly.|ba
And,|sd
Exactly.|ba
and he says, well, I don't know,|sd
I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.|^q
And I said, that's great.|sd
Let me explain to you how you get scholarships|^q
That's right,|aa
That's right|aa
Well, you know, T I, you know, T I offers some good stuff|sv
and then I think there's, I mean I think there's some negatives,|sv
but there's going to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go.|sv
I have, you know, all, -|%
this is the first really large company I've worked for. I've|sd
always been involved in little small, you know, ind-, privately owned s-, owned firms|sd
and so I've never had the, the big benefit package.|sd
So, I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies, you know.|sd
It, when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what, what they offered.|sd
So, I've been real pleased.|sd
Well, that's fantastic,|ba
Yeah.|b
and on whole o-, I would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors.|sv
Think so?|bh
Uh, I can see some, some potential changes that probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
and you can pick what you want|sv
and, yeah.|aa
now it's up to you|ad
it's menu selection, so,|sv
Right.|b
That sounds really good.|ba
I read a thing,|sd
I don't even remember if it was in the DALLASITE or the INSITE one, about uh, companies allowing you, -|sd
and they said that T I was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days. Which I thought sounded like a good idea.|sd
You know, if you've been there, you know, under five years and you get two weeks of vacation|sd
but that's really not enough|sv
and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying, okay, I'm going to want an extra five days this year|sd
and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know,|sd
and they're deducting it all along,|sd
so you, you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time, you know,|sd
you're really not being paid for them,|sd
the money is actually coming out of your own pocket,|sd
but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once, you know.|sd
So, that is kind of an idea that, that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in|sd
and T I said that they were looking into something like that|sd
so, -|%
Well, I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to a, a standardized compensatory time --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days,|sv
Well, -|%
true.|aa
True.|aa
Uh, and, and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one|sv
or, or, you know, maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
But it should be a standard and, and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate t-, uh, that's running in each department.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well,|%
and, yeah,|%
and, and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person|sd
and, you know, I see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the next, you know, about who gets it and who doesn't get it, you know.|sd
But that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there.|sd
It seems like, it depends on what, what group you happen to be in, what, what you're going to get and what you're not going to get|sv
so, -|%
Well, that's for sure.|aa
Which is the same,|sv
but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,|sv
that's, -|%
Oh, I'm sure personalities always come into play.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, just in this size of organization, -|%
Our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive.|sd
Where do you live?|qw
I live in San Antonio.|sd
San Antonio!|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Well, uh, I live in Garland|sd
and we're just beginning to, -|%
we, we just built a real big recycling center,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but, as far as, uh, trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, they're really not full, full force into it,|sd
but they're trying,|sd
so we're attempting it,|sd
but I wish we could do more.|sd
Yeah,|b
there's, there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio.|sd
I used to work for the power company here|sd
and there was discussion for a while about, uh, building a garbage burning, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it just wasn't cost effective, at the time.|sd
Oh.|b
And there's, there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city|sd
but there isn't any, uh, advertising campaign.|sd
There's just not any push to recycle.|sd
Huh.|b
I recycle my newspapers and, uh, alumi-, my aluminum stuff.|sd
Right,|aa
that's what I do.|sd
But, uh, they make it as hard as possible,|sv
it's not very convenient to do.|sd
Right,|aa
when they put centers and stuff like that. -|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|aa
well we have those, uh, which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans.|sv
I don't know if you all have those things around.|qy^d
Yes.|ny
And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center,|sd
and you can just stop by.|sd
Now everything else like the tra-, uh, paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers|sd
but,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and I started doing that at work.|sd
Um, I put out a, a trash can and, and for people to put their aluminum cans in,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and that's really helped a lot,|sd
I mean, everybody's pitched in|sd
and,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
So, I really, I really like that,|sd
but, people are really concerned,|sv
it's just that sometimes it's not the right people,|sv
Yeah.|b
At work we started, uh, all the recycling stuff.|sd
They're really trying,|sd
I think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year.|sd
Yes.|b
And, uh, that really, started a lot of stuff off,|sd
but, you know sometimes it dwindles down.|sv
Yeah,|b
where I work now we recycle all the computer paper.|sd
That's good.|ba
But that's about the extent of it.|sd
Well that's, uh, -|%
at least your trying something.|ba
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
It's just yeah, -|%
it would be nice if it could be more.|sv
And I'm sure that the, uh, driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so.|sv
Oh do you really.|bh
We sell the paper back to the, uh, to a paper manufacturing company.|sd
Well that's a neat idea.|ba
Well, it, it defrays the cost of buying the paper, I think.|sv
I, -|%
not by much, but it does defray it some.|sv
Right.|b
Enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building.|sv
Well that's, that's really good,|ba
I mean at least they're trying.|ba
Yeah.|b
Yeah|b
I know a lot of companies that waste so much that, -|sd
I'm even trying, -|%
you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building|sd
Yes.|b
and I thought, I don't understand this, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
We're trying to cut cost and everything like that, and, and recycle and all that stuff|^q
and, and here we are wasting.|^q
And I don't understand, sometimes, the way, the thinking, the logic behind it.|sd
Well the last time, uh, someone moved offices in my building|%
and, uh, the, uh, properties people came in with all, with the good cardboard boxes.|sd
Not the cheap ones of course.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, I took several home because I'm moving pretty soon|sd
and they're good boxes.|sd
That's exactly what I did.|sd
And they were just going to throw them away.|sd
Exactly what I did, exactly.|sd
Yeah.|b
Because I didn't want to waste that.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
And it's hard enough to find good packing boxes .|sv
Right|aa
and, and these boxes are, -|%
you can unfold them.|sd
Right.|aa
So, you know, there, they don't take up much storage space.|sd
Exactly right,|aa
well that's very good|ba
Yeah,|b
yeah|b
I, I felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until I realized they would be thrown away,|sd
so. -|%
Right,|aa
right,|aa
I thought, well I was doing them a favor by taking them.|sd
I found about five, uh, about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes,|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh gosh,|ba
so many people need, so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
the ones at the grocery store, half the time, they've pulled the lid off|sd
so you can't use it anyway.|sd
Right,|aa
right,|aa
right.|aa
Those -|%
and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in, with the nice lids. Those get thrown away.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
right.|aa
And I am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes.|sd
That's exactly what I do.|sd
Those are perfect boxes to put files in.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They're good for storage and stuff like that.|sd
That's what I do with a lot of my daughter's things is I'll store her, you know, like her out dated or, out of, out of season clothes in them|sd
and they're just perfect.|sd
What, what I've done in the past, -|%
I don't have any now,|sd
but I would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and you can stack them up and, and leave them out and put things in them, even.|sd
And they look just as good.|^2
That's a smart idea.|ba
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|aa
I think I'll have to try that.|sd
That's really cute.|ba
Yeah|b
well, you know, it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at Target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever.|sd
They're the exact same thing.|sv
That's all they are,|sv
they just made them look fancy.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|aa
You saved me some money.|sd
And you're recycling|sd
yeah.|aa
Well that's neat.|ba
Well do you all have, uh, -|%
we have places that, uh, pay for paper to recycle,|sd
I know you do yours at work,|sd
but for newspaper. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
But ours are real hard to find.|sd
That's the one thing that really discourages me.|sd
I saved pa-, you know, I recycle paper,|sd
but they, -|%
it's almost like they don't want the paper, because they don't pay, at all,|sv
I mean, they're real hard to find the places that pay.|sd
And that's really discouraging.|sd
I mean, I just go ahead and take it to the, the regular place, where it's, you know, they just accept it.|sd
But they, uh, I think they should|sd
yeah,|%
if they want people to recycle I think it's, uh, you know, -|sv
like the aluminum, you know, -|%
it gets people to, uh, doing it, you know,|sv
you might, you don't have to pay them a lot.|sv
Yeah,|b
I live near a Walmart|sd
and there's a big, uh, uh, huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front,|sd
in fact I think there's two of them, that have several openings,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it's for recycling|sd
and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't, -|%
maybe there's two for aluminum.|sd
And you don't get paid|sd
but it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there.|sd
Well that's, that's good.|ba
Yeah.|b
I, -|%
the one thing I don't like about the newspaper also is, uh, -|%
like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk.|sd
You have one for paper and one for just your normal trash,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but in, uh, in the paper one you have to separate.|sd
You have to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper, like magazines.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You can't throw any of that away|sd
and you can't throw certain file type things away,|sd
and I just think it's such a hassle,|sd
it seems like it would be, it would be easy to take it all,|sv
I don't know,|h
of course, I don't know all that about recycling|h
so,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But I do get tired of having to separate paper, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It gets to be, uh, -|%
I guess you have to make it a habit,|sv
I mean, you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
And we had, uh, a write up in our paper, uh, this last time at work about, um, -|sd
they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash|sd
and every other day they do your recycling trash.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And somebody was writing in complaining that the people had, uh, dumped all the trash in the same bin.|sd
Oh.|b
And when they were questioned about it they said well, we're running late,|sd
or we didn't have time to do those bins or something|sd
and that's real discouraging. Thinking you're sitting there working to separate it|sd
and then they, -|%
And someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags.|^2
Right,|aa
right,|aa
so they're, they're really, trying to start keeping an eye out for those, you know -|%
talking to the people again about, you know, -|%
separate them -|%
because that is discouraging when you, when you do that the|sv
It was hard to get used to those two different trash cans.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But luckily that will all get straightened out|sd
and, and they'll, they'll start separating them.|sd
Because, I don't mind doing that,|sd
I feel like I'm doing, uh, doing something for the community when I'm doing that.|sd
Yeah.|b
But anyway. -|%
Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.|fc
You too.|fc
Well, I, thank you.|fc
Bye,|fc
bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
I don't know what the, the last thing I've done as far as car repairs go is, is change oil and filter an, and that kind of stuff.|sd
I haven't gotten really involved in anything, uh, extensive in car repairs in, oh, oh, probably a year or so.|sd
I think the last thing I did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile.|sd
Yeah,|b
I had a similar thing, that I've worked on cars ever since I was, uh, a kid|sd
And that was some time ago,|sd
but I've gotten to the point where, uh, the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that, uh, oh, most of the cars -|sd
I buy, I try to buy as simple a car as possible.|sd
Yeah,|b
I know what you mean.|ba
So, you know, changing the oil, changing the spark plugs -|sd
and most of them now, you know, you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or,|sv
Yeah,|aa
or fuel injected,|^2
and so there's, -|%
so there goes the carburetor|sv
and if the fuel injection system breaks down,|sv
Yeah.|b
No|aa
there's no way.|aa
Somebody once said, uh, I had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it|sd
and a woman asked me what that meant|sd
and I said that means that I can't work on it.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
yeah,|b
basically that's it.|ba
You know, they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that, uh, the guys, average guys can't really go out in the, in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs, uh.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I've got, uh, an eighty-four Chevy van that's, uh, a one ton van with a camper conversion on it.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's got the, the, the good old three fifty,|sd
Absolutely.|aa
Regular gas engine,|sd
and that engine I understand,|sd
I can, wo-, I can actually work on that engine.|sd
Yeah,|b
I used to have, uh, ch-, Chevy van,|sd
it was a short van,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And basically it, it was a motor|sd
and you didn't have all the other junk around it,|sd
Right.|b
and you could get to it to work on it.|sd
Yeah,|b
I had to change the water pump in that, here about a year ago.|sd
And it was really fairly easy.|sd
Take the grill out and the radiator out|sd
and you can just stand there and work on it.|sd
Yeah,|b
the hardest part about, uh, water pump changes is getting all the junk off, before you can get too it.|sv
Well that's true|aa
You're right, you know,|aa
by the time you've finally got down to it, -|sv
I was hoping I could remember where all those other things went.|sd
Well that's kind of the way I was,|sd
I tried to remember as I took stuff off where it went,|sd
and I don't think I had too many nuts and bolts left over when I got it all put back together.|sd
A few years ago I had an Oldsmobile diesel|sd
and, uh, the, -|%
uh, it, -|%
after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it.|sd
And, uh, I bought it when we were living in Lubbock,|sd
when I came back here, I brought the car back here|sd
and, uh, I don't know, diesels got pretty unpopular|sv
and you couldn't sell the thi-, -|sv
I mean, though for what you could get for one,|sv
And, uh, the injector pump went bad|sd
so I found a outfit down here to rebuild it.|sd
and that was probably one of the most miserable things I had gotten into in a long time.|sd
I don't think I'd know where to start with a diesel.|sd
Oh, well, it, you know, i-, -|%
diesels don't require mechanics,|sv
they require plumbers.|sv
Well that's true.|aa
And, uh, -|%
I think the onl-, closest thing I've come to, to a diesel is, I've worked for a tractor repair shop, uh, when I was in high school|sd
and, uh, we used to overhaul farm tractors basically,|sd
Yeah.|b
and they were nearly all, all diesel,|sd
but as far as cars I've never, never been involved with them.|sd
Well the injector nozzle and stuff in, you know, the big diesel farm tractors, you know, what are about the size of your thumb,|sd
and the-, -|%
Well, ye-, yeah,|b
and you ca-, you can get to them.|sv
yeah|aa
you can get to them,|aa
and the ones in, in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with.|sd
Well I, -|%
I've had a lot of good service out of that car,|sd
but, uh, uh, I finally gave it to my son|sd
and he drove it literally into the ground, you know|sd
Yeah.|b
He was out at Tech|sd
and he, he finished it off.|sd
I'm, I guess you're right|aa
the, the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status.|aa
I don't know exactly why.|sd
One of the reasons is -|%
I, I'm beginning to wonder is, where do you get gas at.|qh
I su-, -|%
I don't know if it's still, uh, limited like it was,|qy^d
I don't notice it, probably because I don-, -|sd
What,|qw
the availability?|qy
Huh?|br
You mean the diesel availability?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I don't, I don't notice|sd
but maybe because I'm not looking for it.|sd
Yeah,|b
well I'd bought, uh, a G M C diesel pickup and, uh, loved that thing, you know,|sd
I really liked it.|sd
But it turns out a pickup wasn't what I really needed,|sd
Yeah.|b
and it was the van that I needed then, to buy the, you know, -|sd
traded it in on the Chevy van.|sd
But, uh, sure enjoyed it.|sd
But yo-, you got the, the three fifty in the van?|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah|ny
the three fifty regular gas engine.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's what I like because, they've got plenty of power,|sv
and, uh,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I'm convinced that, uh, Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake,|sv
Yeah|b
co-, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
I'm convinced that the small V eight like the, the Mustang's original two eighty-nine or some of the Chevy two eighty-threes,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but they had enough power t-, pull all this weight.|sv
Yeah.|b
And the four cylinders just don't have it.|sv
I think that little, the little Chevy V eight when it started out in sixty, in fifty-five, I think was two sixty-five, something like that. -|sd
Yeah.|b
Little, you know, not whole lot more than the, than the, than the six cylinder that I think was like about two thirty-five or so. -|sv
But, uh, they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred, small block four hundred that was, uh, the same block, you know, just, just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more, an. -|sv
I think those gu-, those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines, if they would have gone with it,|sv
but. -|%
Well that was, uh, that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up.|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
The two little cars I've got now, -|sd
bought a Mitsubishi Mirage here a couple of years ago|sd
and, and it was normally carbureted|sd
and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong,|sd
Yeah,|b
that's kind of like, -|%
the, the first, well my first car was a fifty-six Mustang|sd
and, uh, over the years, uh, all -|%
I had a, uh, Dodge pickup several years ago,|sd
and, uh, I can't remember the size of the engine|sd
it was a three oh, seven or something like that,|sd
Yeah.|b
but, uh, I remember working on those cars,|sd
you'd open the hood|sd
and there was basically nothing in there but an engine,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Now, you open the hood and it's scary.|sv
Yeah.|b
Like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes.|aa
The friend of ours over here, he's got, uh, sixty-five, or sixty-six Mustang the six cylinder.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, I was look under the hood of that the other day|sd
and like you say, you can see the road.|aa
Yeah.|b
It's amazing.|sv
Well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to.|sv
You coul-, yeah, you could stand in there if you really wanted to, I guess.|sv
My dad's got a new, um, -|sd
I guess it's an eighty-nine or ninety, uh, Chrysler something or other.|sd
It's one of those transverse mounted V sixes, front wheel drive.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
And, uh, he was showing it to me|sd
and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean|sd
and, you know, you can see the three spark plugs there in the front.|sd
And I said well where are the other three.|sd
And he'd never really thought about it.|sd
Yeah.|b
And he says well, hopefully I won't have to change them, before I trade it off.|sd
Yeah,|%
it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall.|sd
Yeah.|b
So they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well when they went to the, -|%
started with the newer engines, you know,|sv
when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much, you know, trouble. Because the three fifty with all the, you know, -|sv
like well, actually, I guess, her-, -|%
within a couple of years ago anyway was the last I've paid any attention to it.|sd
The three oh five was that, that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it had all the air pump and, uh, uh,|sd
Right.|b
Yeah|b
the anti-smog pumps.|sd
And all the anti-smog stuff.|aa
And, uh, boy that was, uh, really a mess back under there under the, in that van.|sd
And all that stuff loads the motor down.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
So it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things.|sv
But that's one good thing|sv
I've got a, uh, eight ninety, uh, Chevy Blazer now|sd
and it's got one, uh, belt on it a serpentine belt.|sd
Oh, it's that one that's about, uh, what an inch and a half wide.|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
Got a bunch of groves in it.|qy^d
I haven't had to replace the thing yet.|sd
It looks like it would be, uh, better than having, -|sd
I've got an, an Olds Toronado that, I think's got six belts on the sucker.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I had to get all those off, you know, when I was replace that, uh, water pump.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, I had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck.|sv
You know, when one of them breaks,|sv
Oh man.|ba
it's, it's the, it's usually that power steering be-, -|sv
or something that's way back in there.|sv
You bet,|ba
everything else's got to come off first.|sv
Everything's got to come off.|aa
Well, it's a pleasure meeting you.|fc
Yeah,|fc
and we'll, uh, -|%
how many times have you done this now?|fc
Is this, -|%
Uh, I've got, uh, five stickers here from T I,|fc
so I guess I've done probably, uh, I'd say seven or eight of them.|fc
Yeah,|fc
I hadn't, uh, hadn't, not gotten any calls here in the last, uh, -|fc
this is the first one in a week or so.|fc
Yeah,|fc
I haven't gotten any calls in two weeks,|fc
so I don't know, if, if it's tapering off, or what.|fc
If ta-, it's winding down or what.|fc
I had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting, uh, answers.|fc
Finding a taker.|fc
So it sounds, -|%
it's taken them ten, fifteen minutes at a time,|fc
so, people are either not, -|fc
no-, -|%
maybe they're burnt out or, -|fc
yeah.|%
Yeah, well.|fc
Anyway let you go.|fc
Thanks for talking.|fc
Okay,|fc
all right.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Okay,|b
so do you do a lot of cooking in your family?|qy
Um, I do some every now and then,|ng
I, I work|sd
and my wife's home during the day|sd
so she usually ends up doing most of it.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
When I was single we used to always cook, around the house.|sd
Yeah,|b
do, do you like to cook.|qy
Huh, yeah,|ny
I really like it,|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
um, there's a few dishes, -|%
like, I, I grew up with the, um, you know, having Polish and Ukrainian food.|sd
Oh, really.|b
And my wife, she likes Italian and stuff,|sd
Oh.|b
so we, we definitely have different tastes,|sd
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
but that's neat though, because you get to have different stuff|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
I'm not, I'm a pretty bad cook|sd
I'm pretty bad.|sd
My husband is really good,|sd
he put himself through college working in restaurants.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
And, uh, he's much better cook than I am,|sd
so, when I was home I still cooked a lot|sd
and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff.|sd
And now, I went back to work about a year and a half ago|sd
so, one of the things that he took over was the cooking|sd
and the kids are thrilled,|sd
they're really happy, that I don't cook anymore.|sd
Uh, they're like, uh, preferring it now, right|qy
Yeah,|ny
they say oh dad, let dad cook mom,|sd
let him do it|^q
But, um, so, so do you all, do you have kids?|qy
You obviously have one.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
two,|sd
uh-huh.|ny
Okay,|bk
you have two.|bf
Yeah,|aa
one is, uh, nine months|sd
and the other is two and a half.|sd
Two and half, oh.|b^m
Yeah,|b
that's the hard part is cooking with, uh, kids around because, uh, becau-, -|%
I was just going to say, makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it|qy
Or are you not at that stage yet?|qrr
Yeah,|ny
it does|sd
Yeah.|b
We try our hardest to get them to eat what we, w-, eat, you know.|sd
Right.|b
And my sister, uh, she's the master of the fast order grill, you know,|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
she can make, uh, she makes six different meals,|sd
but. -|%
Oh my gosh.|ba
Like to have one thing, you know, -|sd
one likes chicken nuggets, the other one like hot dogs,|sd
Oh my gosh,|ba
I couldn't|sd
and then she makes noodles with, uh, with,|sd
Yeah.|b
so, all things. -|%
Boy, I couldn't do that,|sd
I -|%
But, um, yeah,|b
our favorite, -|%
let me think,|^h
I was thinking of the one recipe that, uh, that we made.|sd
I guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy,|sd
and that was, um,|sd
What's that.|qw
Oh really.|b
it has a French name,|sd
it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese, cream sauce with it|sd
and you pour it over rice,|sd
Oh yeah,|b
what's, what is that, Saint Jack or something.|qy
Yeah, uh.|ny
Scallops Saint something,|sd
or, yeah, .|%
Yeah,|b
I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore,|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
but, uh, i-, it was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then, uh, standard cream sauce base and then, uh --|sd
Really,|b
with scallops.|^2
An, and it sounds sort of funny|sv
but it tastes really good.|sd
No,|ar
no,|ar
I'm from New England,|sd
so we, we had, um, a lot of seafood before we moved down here.|sd
And, uh, that sounds delicious to me.|sv
Yeah.|b
That sounds great.|ba
Yeah,|b
but, uh, -|%
I think, we're just thinking of having, a, uh, dinner party.|sd
We went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game,|sd
they had, uh, a murder mystery,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and you came dressed as one of the characters|sd
and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it was really fun|sd
and so we, we were thinking we wanted to do, you know, we were going to try doing it ourselves,|sd
but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table|sd
and that kind of interrupted the game,|sd
so,|sd
Right,|b
yeah.|b
and then you can make that ahead|sd
and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So that's, uh, -|%
Yeah|b
that's another thing|sd
I have a problem with my wife,|sd
Yeah.|b
she, uh, she likes to, um, she doesn't like the beef dishes.|sd
She likes the chicken and fish,|sd
Uh, yeah.|b
and, like I said, we always ate beef and, uh, pork,|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
so -|%
I know,|ba
my husband did too|sd
His parents are Austrian|sd
and they, uh, always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table|sd
Oh yeah,|b
red meat, plenty of good red meat.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
My dad could eat, a, a meal with out any vegetables at all.|sd
Oh, my gosh.|ba
And, uh, Susan's, you know, they had, you know meatless meals, you know.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
My dad wouldn't know what to do.|sd
Oh, gosh,|ba
so do you, -|%
Course, she grew up Catholic|sd
so you know, they,|%
Oh, they did the, -|%
there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have|sv
That you do,|aa
right,|aa
right,|aa
that's just part of it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
we didn't, my family didn't,|sd
but when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that,|sd
but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly,|sd
he never, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
There was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Ther-, there were several things that he liked|sd
but it never was really, something that he would have chosen.|sd
It's just that I cooked|sd
so he had to put up with it|sd
Right.|b
So, but there was one thing that he couldn't stand|sd
and that was soybeans.|sd
I tried it like once or twice|sd
and he just could not eat it,|sd
so I never, -|%
I had, -|%
I was limited.|sd
I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans,|sd
but. -|%
Yeah,|b
it's hard to get a protein content up then|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
That's true|aa
Yeah,|b
I like, I like them every now and then for a change,|sd
ye-, it's nice.|sv
Yeah,|aa
some of the stuff is good,|sv
but it just, it was a tremendous amount of cooking|sd
Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and we had little kids at the time, you know,|sd
when I was home with them, and it, it was just so much cooking,|sd
I couldn't, I don't like to cook.|sd
And I'm not really that great at it|sd
so it just turned out to be too much of a, too much, too much cooking.|sd
So, well, I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there.|ad
No, uh,|ar
he's all done.|sd
He's set,|qy^d
oh okay.|%
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
I set him down.|sd
Okay.|bk
Do you like to bake at all,|qy
or do you, do you get into that's, that,|qrr
Yeah,|ny
we used to do that, um,|sd
my mom, used to go crazy, every Sunday, until my dad like blew up, you know|sd
Yeah|b
Af-, after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy, she stopped doing it.|sd
But, um, she used to have, you know, two dozen sticky buns, three bread rolls, you know, every week.|sd
Really,|b
no kidding.|b
And, um, the sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days|sd
and that would be it.|sd
Yeah,|b
then be gone.|b
I know,|ba
that's the thing about baking.|sv
I used to, I, I don't mind baking at all|sd
and I, I can do a pretty good pie,|sd
we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother|sd
and my mother taught me how to make it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, um, so I can make a pretty mean pie,|sd
but, um, I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening.|sv
We had the same kind of problem.|sd
If you make homemade bread,|sv
Uh-huh|b
I mean, forge-, it's supposed to save you money|sv
but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat|sv
It tastes so good.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
we always, we had that bread that was, uh, um, -|sd
you ever seen the, the starter bread,|qy
I can't remember what it's called,|sd
they call it the, um, Amish bread here|sd
but, -|%
Oh, uh, yeah.|ny
uh, it's made with, -|%
you just le-, leave it out,|sd
Yeah.|b
you know, and you let it spoil sort of.|sd
Yeah,|ny
uh-huh,|ny
I've heard of that, I've heard of it,|sd
but I've never done it.|sd
You know, yeah.|b
That sounds pretty good.|ba
Yeah,|aa
it tasted pretty good, really.|sd
Yeah,|b
oh yeah.|b
But, uh, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad|sd
and then you add all these other ingredients to it,|sd
but. -|%
Yeah,|b
and then you sa-, you make the bread|sd
but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.|sd
Yeah|b
right,|b
ye-, you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else|sd
and that's how they continue the thing.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
yeah.|b
I know, it sounds, it always sounded, -|%
I don't know how safe that was|qh
Yeah,|aa
I know it sounded strange to me too,|sd
I figure, well you're baking it|sv
so, you know, yeah.|%
Yeah|aa
that's true,|aa
that's, that's got to kill anything I guess,|sv
but. -|%
Okay,|b
well, I'll talk to you later.|fc
All right,|fc
well, yeah|fc
thanks.|fc
Where are you calling from by the way, Texas.|fc
Plano.|fc
Where?|fc
Yeah,|fc
Plano, in Texas.|fc
Plano,|fc
okay.|fc
Are you in Texas?|fc
No,|fc
Falls Church, Virginia.|fc
No kidding,|fc
gosh it sounds so close.|fc
Yeah,|fc
I know we've got a good connection,|fc
must be a, uh, T I connection,|fc
yeah.|%
Yeah,|fc
I thought for sure, I thought for sure you were in Dallas or something.|fc
Yeah,|fc
I, I talked to so many people from Texas|fc
that's where practically everybody I talked to is from.|fc
Yeah,|fc
yeah.|fc
I think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state, you know.|fc
Yes|fc
they're doi-, they're trying to get all different amount of people.|fc
Well gee, my husband is from Richmond|fc
and I went to U V A,|fc
that's where we went.|fc
Oh, oh really.|fc
Yeah,|fc
yeah.|fc
Yeah|fc
I went to school at, uh, well I went to school at West Virginia University,|fc
Oh you did,|fc
yeah.|%
but I grew up right here in Falls Church, right outside D C.|fc
Yeah,|fc
boy we'd like to get back over to the East Coast,|fc
I'll tell you.|fc
It's nice over there.|fc
Yeah,|fc
it's sort of funny,|fc
I have people that want to go to Dallas.|fc
Oh, really.|fc
Yeah,|fc
one of my, one of my friends here, he was just talking how he's thinking of leaving the company and going to Dallas,|fc
saying how, -|%
Oh, yeah,|fc
no kidding.|fc
Well, things are doing pretty good down here,|fc
we, we were, we tried to move over to Raleigh last year|fc
and there just was, there was so little, such little going on in Raleigh, you know,|fc
you couldn't get a job to save yourself over there|fc
so we decided we'll try in a couple of years,|fc
but, but business is, -|%
Yeah,|fc
yeah.|fc
We were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash, you know.|fc
Yeah,|fc
you probably could, you probably could,|fc
Well Northern Virginia.|fc
Okay.|fc
Okay,|fc
well it's good talking to you.|fc
Nice talking to you too.|fc
Take care.|fc
Bye, bye,|fc
Bye.|fc
Well, I don't, I mean, I don't know what you think about the, subject,|qw^d
I'd, the, I had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the, the sentencing to, uh, to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that.|sd
I've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while I was waiting for them to phone somebody,|sd
and I don't know that that's not a good idea.|sd
That's not a bad idea|sv
I, -|%
um, uh, that, you know, -|%
they probably, need to change it somehow, uh,|sv
the whole system needs changing,|sv
we've just got too many people in there ,|sv
I agree.|aa
and it's another form of sentencing.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But on that one thing, I, I still think it should be a unanimous decision,|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
I agree.|aa
Yeah.|aa
uh, I think we're getting to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be, um, majority vote.|sv
And that's not going to be good.|sv
I don't like that,|sd
no,|aa
No.|b^m
I don't like that at all.|sd
I know my husband served on a, on a jury a few months ago up here in Denton,|sd
but, uh, it was a guy, it was, it was a drug conviction|sd
and I don't remember|%
he had some cocaine and th-, it was accused of selling it,|sd
and I don't remember exactly how much he had|sd
but, uh, actually not selling it , -|sd
there's a difference,|sd
cr-, cro-, couriering it is what, -|sd
ther-, is supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier|sd
and,|sd
Right.|b
And, uh, they, he's, he sat on that jury|sd
and they found him guilty,|sd
and they went through the sentencing phase and everything|sd
and, uh, you know, they were told that, you know, during the trial that this is this guy's first offense|sd
and he's got this clean record,|sd
and, and they ended up, -|sd
the jury, you know, decided, hey, it's time to crackdown here, you know,|sd
and it was time to do this drug thing|sd
and let's crackdown|^q
and let's really, -|^q
and they sentenced him to fifteen years,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they sentencing him to fifteen years -|sd
and, um, after it was all over, uh, the jud-, they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers, to someone in the let me come over in just a second, okay, and sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers|sd
and they were told that, uh, he would probably serve three,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
However, they could not tell the jud-, the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
So, the jury didn't know about it,|sd
so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense,|sd
Sure .|b
and so, you know, we'll give him fifteen which will teach him a lesson|sd
but it's not just, you know, horrible,|sv
Yeah .|b
and he'd been convicted three times before, you know,|sd
Oh .|b
and, and the jury was very upset|sd
and my husband came home, a home, very upset,|sd
I mean, he felt like that, that they had been tricked, you know,|sd
Right.|b
and so something, -|%
I wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change, you know.|qh
Yeah,|aa
the judge might know|sv
or at least it, it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better,|sv
if it didn't we can come back for something else|sv
or, -|%
That's true.|aa
That's very true.|aa
or, or what we've got, -|%
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
Well, we definitely need a change in the system|sv
and, uh, -|%
Yeah,|aa
obviously what we are doing is not working, you know.|sv
It's not working, too .|aa
No.|aa
It's just piling up on us.|sv
Yeah,|aa
and there's, you know, there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way, shape, or form,|sv
Right.|b
and either they're in there,|sv
Right.|b
and they're going to be right back for the same thing|sv
so the system, -|%
We're just not willing to set a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes,|sv
so. -|%
That's very true.|aa
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b^m
I was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day|sd
and I said, you know, I understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the United States, to -|sd
and,|^q
Uh-huh.|b
but I really believe that we need to take care of ourselves,|^q
Right.|b
I mean, we, -|%
and, and the-, -|%
I know people say, oh, it would be cruel to, you know, pull our aid from these other countries|sv
and, and maybe so,|sv
so tell them, you've got five years.|sv
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
And, we will continue funding you for the next two years,|^q
after two years we'll cut it down seven to seventy fiv-, you know, seventy-five percent.|^q
Uh-huh.|b
And after another year we'll cut it fifty percent,|^q
and in five years, it sh-, -|^q
by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help.|^q
Sure.|aa
And then we'll have all, we'll have, we will have the money if we would do that to,|sv
Yeah.|b
and we're trying to,|sv
Very serious, yeah.|aa
it's just not,|sv
Oh, yeah ,|b
your right , .|aa
I look at the, I look at what, you know, thi-, what, the aid presented to the Kurds|sd
and I, I feel sorry for them|sd
and I know they're suffering|sv
and I know they're dying everyday,|sv
but we've got, you know, kids here in the United States that are dying everyday, too.|sv
Sure.|aa
Oh .|b
and, you know, I don't know.|h
I just have this problem with,|sv
You bet .|ba
so. -|%
Right.|aa
Well, we seem to agree on the jury thing|sv
and, uh, but, uh , we'll need an unanimous verdict|sv
and,|sv
Yep.|aa
I think we should try it, like you say,|sv
Yeah.|b
if it doesn't work, we can always come back,|sv
but I think it would be a good idea to try it.|sv
I do too.|aa
So, anyway, well, we all agree.|sv
Well, good.|ba
Good to hear from you.|fc
You too, bye-bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
So I own a, a P C A T at my home.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Uh-huh,|b
I could never justify owning a personal computer at home, uh,|sd
I mean, that's quite an expense to look for, uh,|sv
well, who is this,|qw
what do you use yours at home for?|qo
Well, that's actually a good question.|arp_nd
My wife works out of the home, our home.|sd
She has an office|sd
and in fact she sits in the office|sd
and she uses it to compose and print out letters.|sd
Okay,|bk
well now. -|%
So that's a very regular use of it that she has.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And in addition to that I tinker around with it.|sd
I'm a computer scientist.|sd
Oh.|bk
And so I write programs to do little things|sd
I'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special.|sd
And also I'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like.|sd
Uh, huh, well, excuse me, I, uh, uh, well I'm a technician, electronics tech.|sd
Years ago T I sent me to their, uh, computer school down in Austin.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, uh, I learned to repair one|sd
but you know I never really learned to operate one.|sd
Oh, that's a key thing.|sv
Well, actually that's a, -|%
there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today.|sv
Yes.|aa
So that yo-, -|%
in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming|sv
but if they were careful, they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But I think you you really hit the nail on the head.|sv
For the average person is exactly what he can use it for.|sv
And if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters|sv
or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage,|sv
whatever|sv
there, your issue is then there really, -|sv
Well, uh, space is a handicap with me,|sd
I live in a motor home.|sd
Oh, I see|b
well. -|%
And I'm preparing for retirement.|sd
I see|b
well, congratulations on that.|ba
And I'm not to far from it another year and a half.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, actually one other thing I might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap.|sv
Yes,|aa
definitely,|aa
but just like the computers.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, remember how they started out running three, four hundred dollars.|sd
Right.|b
Oh, the calculators you mean.|bf
I mean ca-, calculators,|na
I beg your pardon.|fa
Yeah,|aa
they sure do.|aa
Yeah|aa
I actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum.|sd
You can actually buy a whole brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars.|sv
You're kidding.|bh
No.|nn
Including a printer?|qy
Well, actually I wasn't including a printer,|arp_nd
but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars|sd
so make it seven hundred.|sd
A hundred?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Wholly smoke,|ba
a respectable one?|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
Well, see of not being particularly interested I don't keep track of prices on them,|sd
but I'm, I'm, that does amaze me.|sd
Yeah,|b
the prices had plummeted,|sd
you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Huh.|b
And then the keyboard is another fifty,|sd
the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred|sd
and then the disk drive is two fifty.|sd
Well, what, what is a a good brand a inexpensive.|qy
Well, that's that's the deal is you're not buying brands now,|arp_nd
you're buying these knock offs,|sd
so there's, -|%
probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called COMPUTER SHOPPER.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's a big magazine,|sd
it's twelve inches acro-, narrow, the narrow side and --|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages.|sd
But the book is, the magazine is full of these mail order, computer mail-order houses|sd
and they're all competing with each.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So you just flip through there until you find a eighty, eighty-eight computer|sd
that that's called, it's the original P C.|sd
So it's, -|%
we call the T I, I'm sorry an I B M P C compatible.|sd
And you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me.|sd
Uh.|b
And you mix and match|sd
and then you do it by mail-order.|sd
But there's no real brands|sd
it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board.|sd
I see.|bk
How do you go about getting one of those a catalogs?|qo
They're available in, you know, the B Daltons, that that type of thing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You'll notice that in that it's, it's a, it's a, although it's a magazine it's large.|sd
And like I said it's about an inch thick|sd
Uh-huh,|b
well, getting back to the P C -s,|sd
I'll tell you,|^h
I ya, -|%
first of all I don't like a machine that's smarter than me.|sd
And secondly, I did learn this much about computers,|sd
they they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten.|sd
In binary.|sd
That's right|aa
There's great.|ba
Well, anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes.|sd
Oh, yeah|b
One and one equals ten.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's great.|b
Course it's it's kind of an inside joke, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
You can only tell that to somebody who understands binary.|sv
I understand,|ba
that's great,|ba
that's a good joke.|ba
So what, -|%
do you, uh, uh, work with a computers a at T I?|qy
I did for years|na
and then I was a scientist over in central research labs|sd
and just recently I've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, now I I type that one,|sd
but I don't use it anymore.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
well I just recently started using one.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
Uh, I keep track of an inventory here.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And of course now that is where a computer is very handy.|sv
Yes,|aa
I agree.|aa
And, well I, it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
See I'm with the Q R A lab.|sd
Oh, I see|b
that's fascinating.|ba
so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they're dated.|sd
So I have to keep up with them, uh,|sd
and and it's very handy doing it on the computer.|sd
Yeah.|b
I just run a printout every week|sd
and and it puts me right up-to-date what I'm, what I have to do, what I have to ship, what I should be expecting to be returned.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So a, -|%
it it is handy.|sd
Right.|b
And I must admit that up until I did start using one, uh, it was, I had very little interest in computers.|sd
Yes|b
But they are amazing.|sv
Yeah,|aa
they certainly are.|aa
So let's see, see|^h
so I guess with respect to the question, -|sv
yeah,|%
I guess we've kind of covered it.|sv
I think we did.|aa
Great,|ba
nice little conversation with you Jack.|fc
Yeah,|fc
Mike you take care now.|fc
Good day.|fc
Good luck to you.|fc
Thank you.|fc
Same to you.|fc
Uh, I guess I've had to return something|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
but I'm ca-, can't decide,|sd
mostly it's been because I didn't like the color,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
or, um, I'm not sure whether I've had to return that many things, uh,|sd
Well, I'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned.|sd
Oh, are you?|bh
So, for me it's actually a pretty good topic.|sd
Okay,|b
good,|ba
so, we'll talk about that some.|ad
Yeah,|aa
well, we could talk about that,|oo_co_cc
and then we could talk a bit about, um, just quality of products in general,|oo_co_cc
Right.|b
Okay,|aa
I'm going to let you kind of lead the pack,|ad
I-, -|%
let me tell you just a little bit about myself.|^h
I, for years I did all that shopping and whatnot,|sd
but for the last four or five years I've had eye problem,|sd
Oh.|b
and I've had two cornea transplants.|sd
Shopping is no fun anymore|sd
I can imagine.|ba
Well, see I don't, -|%
I can't see good enough, you know,|sd
and, uh, it's hard to tell what I'm doing,|sd
and it's just aggrav-, -|sd
You can't read labels|qy^d
and you can't, -|%
Oh, I just thought of something we have to return|sd
Good.|ba
There you go.|ba
All right.|b
It, it'll come to us,|sv
okay?|qy
Okay.|na
Are you ready?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Laurie, all right|b
Right.|b
All right, uh,|b
tell me about your computer, Laurie,|ad
I think that sounds fascinating.|sv
Well, we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project,|sd
and we called up the company and asked them details on it.|sd
We bought it sort of, your not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with,|sd
and they were very happy with the system,|sd
and they felt they've gotten a good price.|sd
And we went in,|sd
we explained what we needed|sd
and yes|ny
we had to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey to get, to meet these people.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so we went there,|sd
we told them about the stuff|sd
and the guy said, uh, that the computer would fit our needs.|sd
And we -|%
these things won't make any sense to you probably|qy^d
but he told us there were,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, yes.|b
And it's called a user boards|sd
or slots is what it's called.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And he told us there's two sixteen bit slots and two eight bit, sorry, two six-, four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user,|sd
and we can put full size cards in there.|sd
And so we said, great, you know,|sd
we'll buy it,|^q
and we put in our order.|sd
And a week later we went back and picked up the computer.|sd
And then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it|sd
and there's only one slot we could put it in.|sd
Oh, lovely.|ba
And at this point we only have one board|sd
so it wasn't so bad|sd
so we used it a bit,|sd
but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in.|sd
Huh.|b
And, -|%
Oh, no ,|ba
the computer was supposed to have two.|qy^d
Well, it has them|arp_nd
but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it, in it.|sd
Oh, I see.|b
they told us there would be no problem because, you know,|sd
I see.|b
In some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it.|sv
They probably didn't know what they were talking about.|sv
Right.|aa
That's completely it.|aa
The salesman didn't know.|sd
Right.|b
So, we went back in,|sd
and we struck an agreement with the people|sd
who said change the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards.|sd
Huh.|b
Okay.|b
So they did that.|sd
And we said are you sure this will work,|sd
we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway, and et cetera,|^q
and they're, they were doing it at their own costs.|sd
And so we said, fine.|sd
And we went back|sd
and we talked to the person a second time and things like that,|sd
and then we come, we get the computer home,|sd
my husband goes to pick it up last week|sd
and we couldn't go get it sooner because I just had the baby,|sd
and|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh .|b
And, uh, he goes and gets it, brings it home,|sd
first of all they're missing components of it like cables so you can't really test it out.|sd
And then second thing, we still can't put the boards in,|sd
Oh, jeez .|ba
Huh.|b
And see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again|sd
and they say they can, you know, do something different and change some connectors|sd
and we hope so,|sd
but it's a hassle.|sd
Yeah,|aa
it really is.|aa
You kn-, you know, it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on.|sv
Right,|aa
and, and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction.|sv
Right.|b
I think that's the worst part.|sv
I, -|%
So, well, actually some things are pretty good with that because I put it on a gold credit card|sd
and I just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation,|sd
and they said, well, you don't have to pay for it yet.|sd
Now that's an advantage, isn't it?|qy
Yes.|ny
It really is.|sv
I think, uh, uh, there's a lot not to be said for credit|sv
but that's one thing to be said for credit.|sv
It, how ,|sv
Yeah.|b
Right.|aa
So, and so, you know, -|%
And I think that's really important.|sv
Well, because these guys if they, um, give us a hard time we're going to say, you, look, you know,|sd
if, if you can't fix this to our satisfaction,|^q
Yeah.|b
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
And if we do that, -|%
I just tell the credit card company, don't pay the charge,|sd
That's right.|aa
No .|aa
But they'll just, you know,|sd
Yeah,|aa
they will,|aa
That's right.|aa
They will,|aa
Yeah.|b
they will put the kind of clout on them that you can't really do.|sv
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
And, -|%
We, -|%
Hal bought me, uh, uh, small, uh, well, uh, uh, little jam box kind of thing|sd
so I'd, -|%
my, I have my ninety-three year old mother living with us,|sd
and so I, she doesn't remember anything|sd
but to keep her entertained, music and some of these things do help.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I thought well, if I had, uh, a nic-, a nice little, um, tape recorder, you know, so that I could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while. And then also so that I can, uh, uh, copy, uh, parts off, I, I do some musicals and things like this and if I can copy sections off that I can use someplace so I figured well this will be good.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, the first, uh, uh, the first time I turned it on, uh, I was recording,|sd
and the next thing I knew the tape was chewed up in the,|sd
Oh, no.|ba
Okay,|%
so after that then you couldn't get a you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then on the other side, when I, when I, uh, I loa-, loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to, uh, to, uh, videotaping they were doing,|sd
and she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far,|sd
and so you can't, you can't get it to run the right, the right way,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so, uh, -|%
What brand is it?|qw
Do you know?|qy
Yeah,|b
so I, I wish I could tell you|^h
I really don't know which brand it is.|ng
It's , -|%
But I was wondering like, you know|sd
in our case where we knew we were buying a copy -|sd
we weren't buying,|sd
Yeah.|b
and I was wondering if you, -|qy^d
No,|nn
I think this is a, I think this is maybe a name brand|sd
and I suspect that it's probably just a fluke, you know.|sv
I have the papers and everything|sd
and we're going to get, just take it back|sd
but, uh, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Do you buy it at some major store?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I think just, uh, just, uh, one of the maj-, major, I think it was a, you know, I don't, I think it was, uh, you know, like a Highlands or something like this.|sd
Highlands|b^m
chain down there that I don't know up here.|sd
Do they have Highlands up there?|qy
Nope.|nn
Don't they?|bh
Well, this is, is was a regular, uh, electronics store, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, I don't think, I don't think there will be too much problem|sv
but I, I guess I'm not sure whether I think things are not made as well.|sd
I think they deliberately sometimes, um, -|sv
I think a lot of things are not made as well.|sv
Don't you?|bh
What, what, for instance, what are you, -|qw
Um, oh, wel-, -|%
of course, it's hard to think of an exact example,|sd
Yeah.|b
but I think that, um,|%
That's good|ba
they're getting a kind of a, attitude of,|%
yeah,|b
I just have , well, I like electronic stuff,|sd
Yeah.|b
for one thing. I know their, work, you know,|sd
cars I think are not made,|sv
Well, -|%
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
Um,|%
I think that's right.|aa
The fact that, -|%
because I , -|%
they want people to replace it after,|sv
Right.|b
The fact that they, that they have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes, uh, dwells on a fact that, you know, uh, -|sv
I've had, I've known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, they may cost a little more,|sv
but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I had a Toyota|sd
and I loved it.|sd
Yeah.|b
My Toyota did,|sd
It does the,|sv
so, part of it is that we need to develop more of a, of a pride in, in, uh, the kinds of things we do so we make them better.|sv
Good.|ba
Yeah.|aa
And it kind of has to start from the top and, and go clea-, or from the bottom maybe and go clear up.|sv
People, -|%
Well, I think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship.|sv
The people just don't care about,|sv
No.|aa
Yeah.|b
You know, the whole, -|%
nobody cares, no, nobody's,|sv
Yeah.|b
Attitude is, is just get me my dollar so I can go do what I want to do, and, on,|sv
Right,|aa
give me my paycheck, so I can go home.|^q
what I'm doing, right.|sv
I think that's too bad.|sv
And it's a shame too because, uh, when you get right down to it most things, there isn't any, if you do a good job, nobody can pay you enough|sv
There isn't,|sv
Yeah.|b
But if you do a good job, you feel enough satisfaction,|sv
so whatever you're paid is enough.|sv
Yeah,|aa
and also I think, -|%
well, I do research|sd
and so I'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, and you get satisfaction out of it.|sv
That's right,|aa
And,|sv
I think they underestimate how much, how much value the satisfaction -|sv
because the companies that, let, give the attitude that, well, you know, -|sv
you're the last one hired|^q
so you'll be the first one fired,|^q
and we just want you to do your day's work,|^q
Yeah.|b
and we don't really care about you,|^q
Yeah.|b
When you've got that type of attitude on it, the people don't care,|sv
No .|aa
And so, -|%
It probab-, it probably basically goes right back into the h-, home though unfortunately.|sv
Starts with the one person that, you know, -|sv
and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay, you know.|sv
Little value just in whatever you do.|sv
Yeah.|b
The,|sv
Doing a good job of it.|sv
and, -|%
Well, we, uh, -|%
taxes, -|%
everyone thinks taxes are too high I'm sure.|sv
But, uh, I think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases.|sv
What do you think?|qo
Uh, yeah,|aa
I, I think so.|aa
I, I'm, uh, I think I'm, I think I'm, uh, a little out of the ordinary in that, that I, I, uh, I think I'm more worried about the deficit, the national deficit than, than, uh, a lot of other people are and think that we need to, we need to either raise our taxes or, or cutback on something|sv
and I don't know what to cutback on to,|sd
At this stage it's hard, to tell.|sv
And, and, uh,|sd
so I'm no-, I'm, uh, think that the, we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that, uh, for Texas|sv
and, and, -|%
Well, at this stage I think we've taxed property almost to the limit because,|sv
Yeah.|aa
I think so.|aa
Yeah.|b
I know|sv
I live in Richardson --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
But now we're getting public services, the schools, the hospitals|sd
and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there, uh, look what the schools could cost you.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
now I'm, uh, uh, oh, I, -|%
we'd, when we moved to R-, Richardson, one of the reasons we chose it was for the, uh, for the schools. And, and realizing that that, that, that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to, uh, to go for that,|sd
Yeah.|b
Then again the, the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent,|sv
and the public,|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh,|%
Yeah.|b
one of the, -|%
uh, I believe, I don't know which one it is, uh, down there whether it's Hobby or, uh, the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition.|sd
Well if you double the tuition, it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I think that's right.|aa
Yeah.|b
That would provide, uh, possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things, see.|sv
Yeah.|b
The so-called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount,|sv
but I p-, eventually I think you may tax people out of smoking even.|sv
I, I don't, I don't know about that,|ar
I, I, -|%
Yeah|b
Well, I quit ten years ago|sd
so I,|sd
I see.|b
Okay.|b
No, uh,|b
Yeah,|b
well, that, that, that would be true.|aa
That would be true.|aa
But, -|%
I know, uh,|sd
my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes I think.|sd
Huh.|b
But all the various taxing authorities that come through, I think the one tax I resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime.|sv
Yeah,|aa
and, and even if it is, isn't going to, uh, uh, provide you with any, any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your, your home to a business, for instance, you know.|sv
Well, this, this is a thing|sv
I think it's like, uh, back east.|sv
You had to start your public transportation when you started your cities.|sv
You can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it.|sv
If we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
But now,|sv
And, -|%
Yeah,|aa
and the other thing is that when it, when it's, the public transportation is established that early on then, then the business, uh, business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that.|sv
Absolutely.|aa
Whereas in, in, uh, in Dallas here we've, we've got, uh, those patterns were well established before, before we really tried to, tried to do the DART.|sv
And, uh, for instance all the, all the, the, uh, office buildings and stuff that are out here in, in, uh, north Dallas as opposed to downtown, -|sv
uh, to try to, to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the, the metroplex to, to, uh, both those centers of, of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area.|sv
Yeah.|b
yeah.|%
Yeah,|aa
just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere.|sv
Yeah.|b
New York -|%
and some,|sv
Yeah.|b
Right,|aa
right.|aa
Someone made the analogy, uh, with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse.|sd
An old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street.|sd
Well, most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street.|sv
Yeah.|b
And I'm just as guilty as anyone else.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
I drive to work every day by myself, uh, without even, even any thought of car pooling.|sd
Yeah,|b
right.|b
And, uh, most people are that way.|sv
Yep.|aa
Yeah.|b
So, but I,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something.|sd
I felt that was a little, uh, wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying, you know.|sv
A little bit much.|aa
Oh, yeah.|aa
Yep.|aa
Yep.|aa
Oh, the c-, -|%
Well, that's about all I can say at this time.|fc
Yeah,|fc
I th-, I think so,|fc
I think that will probably do it,|fc
so. -|%
Okay,|fc
it's been real nice talking with you.|fc
Good enough.|fc
Bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Uh, do you own a P C by the way?|qy
I'm guessing you probably do.|qy^d
I don't have one in my home here.|ng
My, um, parents have one|sd
and they live just about three miles away,|sd
Oh.|bk
so we use that one.|sd
I see.|bk
And my in-laws also have one,|sd
and they're almost as close.|sd
Right.|b
They're in Richardson.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And what kinds of things do you use it for when you us-, when you go to their hous-, houses to them?|qw
Um, usually, uh, word processing something, um, such as, oh, forms for things, uh, -|sd
Yeah.|b
also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years.|sd
Oh.|b
And we got, -|%
uh, the one that my parents have is an Apple Two E.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I have a sister-in-law who is, who works in the Fort Worth school district.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so she got me copies of, uh, several of the Apple programs --|sd
Great.|ba
Yeah.|b
and so we use those|sd
and there's some, -|%
whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game,|sd
so,|sd
Oh, sure.|b
Um, my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things.|sd
Yeah.|b
he's been applying for jobs and things,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
well, I tell you once you get used to having them you, you get spoiled really quickly.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh,|b
I'm, uh, -|%
my father had a software company,|sd
Oh.|b
and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing,|sd
Yeah.|b
But, um, they're kind of old --|sd
Right.|b
so I'm not sure that we'll be able to do, get too many other programs for it.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Um, I n-, I'm a, a writer by profession|sd
and, uh, when, when I was first here in, in Dallas or in Plano, um, and was finally able to, this is, oh, been like fourteen years ago we moved here. And I was finally able to afford a new typewriter, and I got an I B M Selectric. I thought I had died and gone to heaven because|sd
Oh.|b
I have one of those.|sd
Yeah.|%
Well, then, um, -|%
Mine's broke at the moment,|sd
but -|%
Yeah,|b
ours really needs to have some work done on it|sd
but, but then my husband, um, worked at T I|sd
and I got a, um, this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore, but he got a, um, uh, the, the T I professional and brought that home|sd
and I learned Wordstar on that,|sd
Oh.|b
and, boy once that happened, there was just no way that I could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter.|sd
Yeah,|b
I learned, I, I learned Wordstar, uh,|sd
I did some typing for my father when he had the company --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so I learned that on there too,|sd
that was, -|%
Yeah.|b
Have you ever used, do you use WordPerfect ever? Have you ever used WordPerfect?|qy
Or, -|%
I haven't.|ng
That's the one that my father, -|sd
well, I guess I have used it once or twice.|arp_nd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer.|sd
Right.|b
He's got on I B M.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
That's probably where you've used it.|sv
And, uh, so that's the program that they're using there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah. Um,|b
I have that on my, uh, computer here|sd
and also, um, I do some work at U T D|sd
and, uh, that's what they have there|sd
and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and, and already know the langu-, you know, already know the, the software.|sd
And, um, I don't know from my own experience, um,|sd
WordPerfect is just so much better than, than Wordstar at least the version of Wordstar that I used to have.|sd
It may be improved by now|sd
but, -|%
That's what I've heard.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's, uh, Wordstar was never very intuitive to me.|sv
I mean you know, you, -|%
some of the commands just had nothing to do with, you know, what you were supposed to be doing what they, what they did on the com-, computer|sv
but, uh, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
I mean like going, um, forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just, you know, didn't match with the kinds of keys,|sv
Yeah,|aa
you had to,|sv
Yeah.|b
and, -|%
And, but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways.|sv
And you, and it does a lot of things too that if you, if you do any kind of, uh, research or anything like that where you have to, uh, use footnotes, it is just wonderful.|sv
Oh.|b
Oh, that's neat.|ba
Yeah,|aa
and if you add it, if you put a footnote in, in the middle, you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it, you just change, um, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you.|sd
Oh, how wonderful.|ba
So, you know, it's just, -|%
That, I had heard that that was better.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
And I think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything,|sd
and oh, it was just awful.|sv
So, um, I don't know I think we have just become really spoiled.|sv
But I think,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
I agree|aa
So, um, well, I have not really paid much attention because I -|sd
clock, -|%
although I think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes -|sd
so, um, if you, um, unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with P C -s. -|qy^d
Not too much.|ng
What kind of, what kind of things do you write?|qw
Well, um, I was a technical writer for many years, um,|arp_nd
Oh|bk
and my husband and I actually met in a computer company.|sd
Um, I was a tech writer|sd
and he was an engineer. And, uh, so I did tech writing for a number of years.|sd
to her Go talk to Daddy about it.|t3
Excuse me.|ad
Oh, sure.|aa
to her Go on and talk to Daddy about it|t3
Tell Daddy I unplugged it for you.|t3
But you don't need to drag it down the hall|t3
Got a problem, huh?|qy
Um,|%
Daddy, Daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged|sd
Oh. Trying to figure out what all that was about, huh?|qy
Yeah.|ny
But, um, I have, -|%
um, that, that was the majority of my writing although, um, I have also done oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing.|sd
And, um, for a while I had a, um, uh, a partnership with a, in an advertising agency with another woman who is a, an artist.|sd
So I did some advertising and P R|sd
but, -|%
Huh.|b
um, now I'm, actually I'm, I'm not working anymore.|sd
I'm a student, I'm a graduate student|sd
so I'm doing a lot of writing|sd
but, uh, now all of the sc-, scholastic majors though, -|sd
Yeah.|b
I've done a little, a lot of different kinds,|sd
but I, I just know right now that I couldn't have put out half of what I did if that much without the being in computers|sd
so that's been really great.|sd
And, uh, I'm, so I'm real spoiled.|sd
Yeah.|b
I'm anxious some day to have one here.|sd
Yeah.|b
I'm, -|%
and they just talked to the other day other day about setting something up again|sd
so --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
My nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type --|sd
Good.|ba
so. -|%
That's great.|ba
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b^m
I've, -|%
Well, those are skills that she certainly w-, is going to need early on|sv
and, you know, the,|sv
That's right.|aa
So,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
so. Uh, do yo-, d-, -|%
We've been, we've been, uh, writing a story together.|sd
Oh, neat.|ba
And so I, and I wanted her to put it into the computer,|sd
Yes.|b
Right.|b
Oh, great.|ba
And so I decided well, if she's going to do that, it would be a whole lot easier if she could type|sd
Right|b
So we'll slowly learn just to type here and then --|sd
That's great.|ba
Well, that's a, that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life,|sv
so|sv
Yes,|aa
yes.|aa
I agree.|aa
Well, Nola I have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly.|fc
This is really going to be fun I think,|fc
Yeah.|fc
and, um, my husband is a ham radio operator|fc
and I think about all the people that he talks to all over the, -|fc
Well, Steve, did you go to college?|qy
Yeah.|ny
In fact, I'm still going.|sd
Oh, that's good.|ba
So you probably could give some great advice.|qy^d
Uh, well, I don't know about that,|arp_nd
but I, in fact, I'm in the process of trying to choose a P H D school.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, what's your ca-, what's your interest,|qw
your, uh, -|%
Uh, well, computer science and cognitive science.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
That, that's similar to what, -|%
I'm in a P H D program right now.|sd
Oh, I see.|b
And, uh, my area of expertise, it's information systems, which is a little bit less technical, I think, than, uh, than computer science.|sv
But my area of expertise is, uh, uh, human computer interaction.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
And I think that's one reason why I'm part of this study, uh, because it's of, I'm working with voice systems.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b^m
So, so, good luck.|ba
I guess we should talk about giving advice, though.|ad
Wh-, what, what type of advice do you think you'd give to a, a parent?|qw
To a parent?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Well, you know, the thing is, when you're a kid --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
An, and, I mean, choosing from my experience, you know, I thought, you know, my, I know what I want a lot more than my parents know what I want.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, I don't know,|h
at the same time, you have to decide what is important about the school,|sv
you know, the size of it or, -|sv
Yeah.|aa
I think that's more important probably than even the career vocation, because most people change.|sv
Yeah.|b
I kn-, I know very few people that, uh, started in one field and stayed with it.|sd
You know, they, -|%
I think that's what you just said, you know, having to do more with the size of the school, the environment of the school, uh,|aa
I think that's much more important.|sv
I, I think I'd, I'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school, though, that has a number of different types of programs, you know,|sd
that, uh, some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer,|sv
but some of the, uh, the small, some of the larger small schools, you know, I guess around three or four thousand students --|sv
Yeah.|b
so if the kid does change, they don't have to transfer,|sv
or they don't have to, uh, uh, -|sv
I don't know, they don't have to give up years of, you know, of credit transfer and things.|sv
Yeah.|aa
That's disruptive.|sv
Yeah.|b
I normally, -|%
and, and parents hate to hear this, you know,|sv
because I, I actually teach college,|sd
I hate to, uh, I hate to talk to the parents|sd
because, um one of the reasons is because, you know, the kid doesn't know exactly what they want,|sv
and I always say make sure you major,|sd
I, I think most employers would probably rather hire, you know, a, a three six in, um, in history, uh, to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration.|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
Does that make sense?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Well, yeah,|ny
I see what you're saying.|sd
Yeah.|b
I always, you know, tell them that you should major in something you, you're going to get good grades in.|sv
Yeah.|b
I don't know.|h
Uh, give me five minutes.|t3
Yeah.|b
Oh, you, you're at the office now?|qy
Yeah.|ny
At work?|qy
Yeah.|%
Yeah.|qy
I'm just getting ready to go to lunch|sd
Uh, yeah,|%
that's like what we were saying, though,|sv
would you, uh, advise a private school, or a public school,|qy
I would, I would,|na
you know, what's the trade off there,|qw
what, -|%
I, I tell you,|^h
I live in Maryland,|sd
and the public schools here are,|sd
I teach at a public school, actually,|sd
and I know that the S A T scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public sch-, a lot of the private schools.|sd
And, um, I actually, I would full time at a, at a public school, -|sd
and then right now I'm teaching part time at a private school, at a Catholic institution.|sd
Oh, I see.|bk
And, um and I really think, I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more,|sv
and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated,|sv
where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are public, are, are college educated,|sv
and I don't, I think because it costs less, the kid doesn't take it quite as serious, you know,|sv
they're not, th-, -|%
it, it's the minimal cost.|sv
But I think you can get a good education at public or private|sv
but I think you can also get a bad education at public or private, you know,|sv
I -- -|%
Yeah.|b
-- you have to really, you have to look around at the school.|sv
I, I think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
I think, uh, I would agree with that.|aa
In fact, the thing that, I'm going through the same thing, where in graduate school,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, a particular institution might be better --|sv
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- yet, like, say, you know, the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Yet, if I go to U of I or C M U or, you know, some, you know, any big name school, my quality of education might not be that much better,|sv
but it's the same thing,|sv
there's, you know, what will the name recognition,|sv
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
does it have a big ten football team|qh
or, -|%
Yeah,|aa
yeah|aa
That's that's usually the basic criteria.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I mean, uh, yeah,|aa
is it a PAC ten school, you know.|qh
Yeah.|b
But I think, -|%
yeah,|%
see, I'm, I'm at the University of Maryland, so in this, this region, um, though I go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland, my diploma will still say University of Maryland.|sd
Oh .|b
Um, you know, it doesn't, doesn't differentiate on my diploma, though I would put it on my resume, what program I went to.|sd
But I, I think, you know, I'm actually at a smaller program,|sd
I'm not at the col-, the big College Park campus, you know,|sd
that's the big one with the football team.|sd
Yeah.|b
So I, I think, um, I think you're right, that there's a lot of, there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition.|aa
Um, you know, when I first was applying for graduate schools, I applied to some big programs, you know, in this area, like Stevens Institute of Technology, which is recognized in the Northeast as, as, you know, one step below M I T in a sense,|sd
Yeah.|b
so it's got big name recognition in this area, a big science school, no football team, but a big science school,|sv
Yeah.|b
and technical people know that.|sv
But I don-, -|%
yeah,|%
I think you're right,|aa
you really have to think about that for the job.|sv
I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor's,|sd
and when I, -|%
now, I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs,|sd
I was going to be a teacher,|sd
I was just a high school teacher,|sd
so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of,|sd
Yeah.|b
you know, but then when I went, um, for graduate work, you know, or for a new job, people said to me, you know, Shippensburg State, where is that, you know|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah|b
And, you know, when I went into higher education, even at other universities, they weren't aware of it, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
So I think yeah,|sv
that's important,|sv
um, I think it depends on if you want to be a, if you want a regional job or a national job,|sv
you need that first,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
I, I guess another thing that concerns me is, uh, so many people, it seems like everybody today is still in that job market talking to someone else in|sv
and, uh, um, where was I at?|qw
Oh, go-, in going to school, you get taught the things you learn in school,|sv
but there is also a whole other dimension, I mean the growing up while you're going to school part.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
yeah.|aa
And, uh, actually, in the Midwest especially, a lot of the schools have, like University of Missouri, will have a main campus like Columbia, which is big, multi disciplinary,|sd
Right.|b
and they'll have a satellite campus in a, usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field.|sd
So you've really, uh, I guess sacrificed --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Yeah,|aa
depending on your technical areas.|sv
Yeah,|aa
Yeah.|b^m
I could see that.|ba
But, you know, at some of the large schools, I know that at, at, at University of Maryland where I am, you know, in a P H D program, I, I haven't even met, uh, someone outside of my area of information systems except for, -|sd
Does your family normally have a reunion?|qy
Do you have one,|qy
Well, -|%
that's been, -|%
on my father's side we've really there, uh, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
On my mother's side we've had several,|na
not,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but usually sometimes every few summers.|sd
Well, all, see, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.|sd
Right.|b
So they're pretty much just reunited always --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so it's, it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.|sd
Well, it might be a good time for you to be-, to, to start a tradition.|ad
I know,|aa
that's -|%
You could be responsible for that yourself.|ad
do that, -|%
that's true.|aa
Sure.|b
How about your family?|qo
Well, in my family, let's see, last October was the forty fifth annual --|sd
Wow,|ba
you're,|sv
The first Sunday in October, the Jordan family gets together.|sd
Oh, that's good.|ba
And all of the descendants of the Civil War, I mean, yeah, the Civil War veterans come together,|sd
and they come as far away from California,|sd
and there's usually oh, between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people.|sd
And then where do you meet?|qw
Uh, there's a big community hall in Vernon --|sd
Okay.|bk
and, uh, that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family.|sd
Okay.|bk
Do you have relatives in Vernon --|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Okay.|bk
Right,|na
uh-huh.|ny
A lot of the older family lives in Vernon.|sd
Right.|b
Um, all of his direct descendants, descendants have now died|sd
and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties.|sd
Oh.|bk
So we're talking about second and third great children here.|sd
Right.|b
Uh, I take my boys well, I took them up until this year,|sd
they're grown and gone from home now --|sd
Oh.|b
-- so they, they take their family.|sd
Right.|b
But, uh, let's see,|^h
that would make them, grandfather, great grandfather, great great grandfather,|sd
okay,|%
so it would be the second great grandchild.|sd
And so they, -|%
Okay,|b
so this town hall that you meet in, is that like a, um, -|qy
Well, it's a community center, it's a community hall.|arp_nd
It's,|sd
Okay.|bk
and, uh, you just bring the covered dishes.|sd
Every, every family brings a, a dish of some kind,|sd
and you get all the wonderful old family recipes,|sd
Potato salad and, uh, -|qy^d
Well, we try to stay away from those things which might have, uh, salmonella in them.|arp_nd
Oh, that's good.|ba
And we choose to bring congealed salad.|sd
You can bring a congealed vegetable salad,|sd
Right.|b
And we are very conscious of, most of us are very conscious of, of, uh, sanitation aspects,|sd
Right.|b
I always,|sd
Oh, that's nice.|ba
Uh, that happens to be my specialty for that family.|sd
I do other things very well,|sd
Right.|b
but there are others in the family who do them better.|sd
Do they always have the, the one person in the family who knows, or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best,|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Well, that's good.|ba
Well , I had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions,|sd
so I learned a lot about them.|sd
I haven't,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but we talked,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
you all equated the family reunions as,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It was, it was an interesting theory.|sd
She talked about the, uh, the Catholics|sd
all, it's a home centered, you know, it's all family centered anyway,|sv
so you usually are living where your parents live|sv
and it's all, -|%
your, you don't have to come home,|sv
so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe,|sd
but when the Protestant ethic happened in America, there were people who ever went out and, you know, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come back home for their reunion, so that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
But she had, -|%
it was interesting, you know,|sd
I don't know how valid it is,|sd
but she talked about that and how the, the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together, and, um, you know, about the bread and the ritual placement.|sd
Do you have a, a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every, every year?|qy
Is there kind of a, you know, -|qy
salads go first and things like that?|qy
Well, it's, uh, -|%
we have, uh, uh, kind of a core group that, that serves as, quote, officers of the organization,|arp_nd
Right.|b
and they plan the reunions,|sd
the organize the, you know, who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there, who's going to rent the tables, who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer.|sd
Uh, and each year it's done a little bit differently, because different people serve in those roles.|sd
Well, that's pretty .|ba
We have a biographer who, who continues every year to save clippings on any family member,|sd
and they're entered into a, a wonderful, uh, scrap book. And pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and, and obituaries to those who are gone.|sd
And it keeps the family alive,|sd
Sure does.|aa
That's wonderful.|ba
And they're very dedicated to that,|sd
and, uh, it's been really wonderful.|sd
It helps you hang onto your roots.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I wish we'd, -|sd
And it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging.|sv
My husband, on the other hand, was not very close to his family.|sd
His family was very scattered and very diverse.|sd
Right.|b
And I asked him, I got to talking to him,|sd
I said, well, how is his nephew doing.|sd
"Well, I don't know,|^q
I haven't,|^q
I said , "Well, how's your brother doing?"|sd
"I don't know."|^q
Uh, you know, my son keeps in touch with him, I think,|^q
but I don't.|^q
Right.|b
I said, "Hey, wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people?"|sd
"Yeah,|^q
but I'm, you know, -|^q
it's too much trouble."|^q
So I got busy, got together, and put a reunion together for his family.|sd
Wow.|ba
You're just, uh, -|%
Oh, that's incredible.|ba
Liked to kill me, because I ha-, it was, I didn't have that group cooperation,|sd
I did,|sd
Right.|b
And, uh, nobody brought covered dishes.|sd
We had a great big fish fry,|sd
and, you know, I fixed a salad in a number three tub.|sd
Right|b
And, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping.|sd
And, uh, we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them|sd
and I told him, -|%
Have you, have you done this repetitively, or just once?|qy
We did it that year,|sd
and then the following summer, we did not have all of the family there.|sd
We sent invitations.|sd
We said, "Please let us know if you're coming."|sd
It was when, uh, his mother, his step father had died the year before,|sd
Oh.|bk
and it, -|%
his mother was alone, and so they came to support her,|sd
and then one by one, his broth-, you know, his sisters, he began to lose family members,|sd
See, that's -|%
we've we had a problem with that.|sd
and it was difficult to hold them together.|sd
And then, of course, he died two years ago,|sd
so, you know, that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.|sd
Oh.|bk
And, uh, it, -|%
I think that's what happens when they get scattered,|sv
the, the family unit, you know, falls,|sv
Right.|aa
That's our, was our problem.|sd
We had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then the second reunion, people who maybe, you know, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and so it kind of wound down,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then finally, you know, you're lucky to get, you know, you get the Shreveport relatives there, but no one else|sd
so that, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Well, see, we manage, those people who are at that core group manage to keep, keep the vigor alive.|sd
They'll send out news bulletins.|sd
Two or three times a year you'll get a news bull-, -|sd
hey, guess who got, you know, elected to the legislature,|^q
or guess who our local sheriff, -|^q
Well, what I believe is one of the major pro-, uh, things that is wrong with our public school system is that, um, we do not have enough discipline --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|aa
I agree with that.|aa
Uh, when I went to school, I know I was scared to death --|sd
You were?|bh
and the discipline that my daughter receives now --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
You know, you just, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
From what I understand, they act up pretty bad|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
What, uh, grade is your daughter in?|qw
My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
-- and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
-- and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.|sd
Oh, no,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
They always had a paddle in our school.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, they, they just don't do that any more.|sv
I know.|aa
But the school system's afraid of getting sued --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid|sv
and we still don't have enough money towards --|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
Uh-huh.|aa
And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we --|qy
Yes --|ny
-- supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for,|sd
and --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, I don't know your feelings toward that.|qw^d
I guess we shouldn't get into that|ad
but,|^h
I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
No.|ar
Really?|bh
Oh, yeah,|ny
Ooh.|bk
I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school. -|sd
Uh-huh. Um. -|b
Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system.|sd
I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.|sv
Oh, I do too,|aa
I think they're doing real good job.|aa
Uh-huh,|b
so. -|%
But, then, what do I know, --|qh
-- I don't have any kids.|ng
No,|nn
none at all|sd
Yeah,|bk
okay,|bk
so this is probably a real hard subject for you.|qy^d
Oh, yeah|ny
Yeah.|bk
Okay,|bk
well, I guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.|fc
Okay.|fc
It was a joy in talking with you.|fc
Well, it was good talking to you too.|fc
Okay,|fc
thanks.|fc
We'll see you,|fc
bye-bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
Well, what do you know about Latin American policies?|qo
Well, I think they're kind of ambivalent, really.|sv
Uh, I just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
We, we don't know, half the time we don't know who to support.|sv
That, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that depend on us so much --|na
Right.|b
but, -|%
That, that's just it.|ba
It's got to be tough,|sv
but, I mean, uh, uh, you sure, you still have to, you know, let them know how you feel.|sv
Right,|aa
I guess my concern, you know, no matter which, no matter which side we take we're going to have supporters and we're going to have, uh, antisupporters, I guess, for lack of better term,|sv
and, uh, like you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound to upset somebody,|aa
but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it worries me that, uh, the economy of so many countries in, in South America and Central America depend on something that damages people, like the, you know, like cocaine --|sv
Right.|b
and --|sv
Right.|b
but --|sv
That's true.|aa
and it, -|%
I don't think that, -|%
maybe I, maybe it's, you know, I'm reflecting how I feel about it,|sv
but I have a feeling that we, that we really don't understand basically the, the, the competing factions in lot of those countries|sv
and --|sv
Sure.|aa
and it's still going on,|sv
and, uh, we, we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how,|sv
Yep,|aa
that's about the lump sum of it.|aa
Well, um, I was speaking with a, a woman|sd
from, I believe she was from the Honduras or Guatemala, or somewhere in there,|sd
no,|ar
she was from El Salvador --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and, uh, she was from a relatively wealthy family,|sd
and when, uh, the Contras came into power, of course with, -|sd
uh, oh, gosh darn, what's his face,|t1
he's in, in Florida jail now,|sd
Marcos -- -|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
-- uh, no,|ar
he's, Marcos is Philippines,|sd
Yeah,|aa
um, well, I'm blank on it.|sd
Well, you know who I'm talking about.|qy^d
I can see his face forget his name|na
Yeah,|b
I, I know it, uh,|sd
anyway, when he came into power, he basically just took everybody's property, you know, just assigned it to himself.|sv
Yeah,|aa
kind of nationalized it --|sv
Right --|b
-- right,|aa
and, uh, so she's been a real strong supporter of the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the U S government in that respect,|sd
and in that respect I have to agree that I think we're taking the right stance --|sv
Yeah.|b
Dictator, -|^2
-- yeah,|aa
right --|aa
Yeah.|b
-- basically a dictator fascist. -|sv
And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing,|sv
it just --|sv
Sure.|aa
Well, what do you think of, uh, this, uh, U S free trade agreement we're working on with Mexico?|qo
Well, I think it's long overdue --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- uh, I just, you know, -|%
there's so much difference in, in the economies of the two countries, I'm not, you know, I have a problem, uh, with whether it's going to work or not, you know,|sv
there's, uh, it seems like there's, -|%
and I, -|%
this may be unfair to Mexico,|sv
but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in, in foreign policy a lot of the times.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
Mexico, -|%
they're, I know they're trying, they're really trying, the Mexican government is trying,|sv
and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to, oh, make themselves Americanized, I guess --|sv
Yeah.|b
The big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule --|sv
Yeah --|b
and --|sd
-- yeah.|b
and there's, the cultural differences is what's, is what's kind of, it's what's really hurting, uh, the Mexican people, because they've had their way of life,|sv
and we've had our way of life,|sv
and, uh, -|%
I think their, their version of the good old boy network going that, -|sv
uh, you know, has a lot, -|%
Well, let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we've got going on?|qo
I think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the Middle East.|sv
I have to agree with you there.|aa
I, uh, I think that, uh, for once, we should, we shouldn't even be at, at these Mid East talks because, with the exception of our hostages, we really don't have too much of a, uh, real in-, we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding whose land it is.|sv
Just let these people fight it out --|sv
I agree.|aa
-- you know, we've got so many domestic problems,|sv
and, and what does it cost these people over there, you know.|qh
Absolutely.|aa
Oh, so how about the Soviet Union.|qo
What do you think's going to happen there.|qo
The break ups?|qo
I think that's great.|sv
Um, I'm glad to see that,|sd
but I, again, I don't want to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a, uh, well, uh, a whole lot under any circumstances because I, I don't know,|sd
I'm, I'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them,|sv
and so, I'm, I'm not much in favor of it,|sd
but I'm glad to see us advising them --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money.|sv
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
But I'm ready to have a President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda,|sd
even if it doesn't work, at least he is somebody who, who is working on that problem.|sv
And I, I haven't seen that in the last eleven years,|sv
so --|sv
Well, all I've seen. -|%
Reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side of, of, of his political affairs.|sv
I, I think Bush's kind of followed suit.|sv
Um, international is important,|sv
but, uh, we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed.|sv
Uh, you know, and then there's the homeless issue,|sv
and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without, uh, hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations I think,|sv
and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending.|sv
Oh, I agree.|aa
I just, I think we got, once we started economic aid overseas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the, the world bank, and --|sv
Right.|b
and I think there's a limit,|sv
and we passed it a long time ago.|sv
I agree.|aa
We've been writing off way too many bad debts --|sv
Yeah.|b
That's another thing I don't understand is, is, is things like selling technology and, uh, even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt --|sd
-- to me that just doesn't make any sense,|sv
as, as much in debt as we are -- -|sv
I know it.|aa
-- I just, I don't know.|h
I think it's definitely time for a change,|sv
but I don't see anybody, -|%
I don't understand, too, why we have to have Democrats and Republicans,|sd
and it's either one way or the other,|sv
this --|sv
Right.|b
you either do it this way|sv
or you do it that way,|sv
and there's no in between --|sv
That's right,|aa
you're either liberal or you're conservative,|sv
-- and that, uh, it obviously isn't working.|sv
Well, I think, uh, it wouldn't hurt,|sv
and I know the Independent Party's been trying for years to get a, a, a real force in, in the, uh, in Congress,|sd
but, uh, you're right,|aa
there's just too many issues that come up that, uh, our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a Democratic issue or it's a Republican issue --|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
-- and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel, I think, uh, we might have a, a lot better, a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed.|sv
Oh, I agree with you.|aa
Well, of course, you know, we have the national embarrassment in our state, Jessie Helms,|sv
and, uh, as soon as, as we can get, -|%
of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth, he, he just lines up people against him|sv
so,|sv
He's, uh, usually on the ninety-eight to two side,|sv
he's the one of the two that votes,|sv
He's one of the two, huh.|bh
Yeah,|ny
he's,|sv
Well, let's see,|^h
Senators are in for six years, right --|qy
Right.|na
-- and, uh, when did you guys vote him into office?|qw
Oh, unfortunately nineteen ninety.|sd
Oh, you're stuck.|sv
Yeah,|aa
we're stuck with him for --|aa
but, uh, unfortunately for him, but maybe fortunately for us, his health is not great,|sd
so, I hate, -|%
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
well what do you do on your yard?|qo
Well, uh, typical lawn stuff.|sd
Saint Augustine, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- uh, and really all I do to it is, -|sd
uh, in fact, I didn't even fertilize it this year,|sd
I just mowed it,|sd
and I, I mow it, uh, you know, with a mulch mower so the, the particles fall down --|sd
Comes back in the yard --|qy^d
-- Yeah.|ny
-- so you don't have any one do your yard.|qy^d
You do it yourself?|qy
I do it myself.|na
Yeah,|b
we do too.|sd
Have a lot of people trying to do it for me|sd
Isn't that the truth.|ba
A flyer's on every door every day.|sv
Hey, I need the exercise,|sd
so what the heck.|qh
That's right.|aa
Well, we, um, we, my husband does the same thing,|sd
he does the yard,|sd
and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower,|sd
but I keep putting off learning.|sd
Hey, you've got the right idea.|sv
That's right.|aa
But I had recently gone out and planted mums.|sd
We had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago,|sd
and so while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and put out yellow and bronze|sd
and they're just gorgeous, and so then last week my mom comes in town,|sd
and she says Well, those are going to die just the first frost.|sd
She said, You should have done pansies.|sd
And I went, Well, now you tell me.|sd
Yeah|b
So the first night, that around Halloween -|sd
and we went out and covered them with a sheet,|sd
and they did okay that first night.|sd
But the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it,|sd
so I guess I've lost them.|sd
I haven't gone out to check yet.|sd
Yeah,|b
I don't blame you.|ba
I wouldn't want to look at them.|sd
No,|aa
listen,|ad
but, um, the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here.|sd
I guess it was about four years ago.|sd
And we did not know in August to put down the, uh, whatever it is for grub worms.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And the next spring, I guess in that March, every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed, we'd have big whole patches come up.|sd
Have you ever seen it --|qy
Yeah.|ny
Yeah.|ny
And we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it,|sd
it would just come off in the rake, down to the dirt.|sd
So we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything.|sd
It took a lot of money and a lot of time,|sd
so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon.|sd
Yeah,|b
you, you think that's what it was, huh.|qy
Oh, yeah,|ny
we found them --|sd
Okay.|bk
-- yeah|b
we found them.|sd
We dug under there about an inch|sd
and you could see them.|sd
They're real fat little white things,|sd
and --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
those kind of brown, uh, Ju-,|sd
-- yeah,|aa
but in, but in the, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
-- and some people call them May beetles.|sd
Yeah,|aa
June bugs is what I'd heard them called,|sd
so any how, occasionally I find them in the flower beds.|sd
They said that every yard has some --|sd
Uh, yeah.|b
-- but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem.|sd
So that's the number one thing we do, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned so badly before.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, I had some of that problem,|sd
but mine was freeze.|sd
Oh, yeah|aa
that too,|aa
two years ago, or last Christmas --|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
Yeah,|ny
I'm still --|sd
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
I caught Wolfe with, uh, uh, one, uh, one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents,|sd
and, uh --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
I guess you did too.|sd
It's what they've done in the spring --|sd
Uh, well, I put, you know -- -|%
-- that was late,|sv
that was like, -|%
Yeah,|aa
because I started to say, you can, there's different times they say it's okay to do it.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that was like September, I think.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I had to water it, you know --|sd
Yeah --|b
-- gosh.|ba
-- keep it damp.|b
Well, my, -|%
out here, you know, we don't have as many trees in Plano,|sd
at least the area where, -|sd
we're over by Collin Creek Mall,|sd
and, but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front, like the pittosporum all died,|sd
and all those variegated, uh, things died.|sd
So we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly,|sd
and they just live,|sd
Yeah,|aa
they're pretty tough, uh,|sv
Yeah,|aa
you can, you can stand those.|sv
Pittosporum is kind of borderline here --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and usually it'll do pretty well,|sd
but, uh, you know, every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and it zaps it.|sd
Well it's kind of like one of these, -|%
Oh, wax leaf, wax leaf ligustrum is the same way.|sv
Same way, -|aa
uh-huh.|aa
That, they, they warned me of that one finally.|sd
And I said, You know, you need to either read Neal Sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery, because lot of places that would, are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there,|sd
and we didn't know the difference.|sd
And every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before. Like about these mums.|sd
Yeah.|b
Okay,|b
next year, I'll do pansies.|sd
Your list is growing,|sv
And my backyard, we had it really nice,|sd
and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy,|sd
and so, it was about, -|%
I guess he's three now,|sd
so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants --|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
oh, gee.|ba
Um.|b
So, it's like our backyard is just kind of like, -|%
as long as he won't damage it, fine,|sd
and if he'll, if there's anything he'll hurt, we just don't put it out there any more.|sd
Yeah,|b
kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds,|sv
yeah.|%
Uh-huh.|aa
Very much,|aa
but, uh. -|%
I had a, had a small vegetable garden that, uh, -|sd
You did.|b
It did pretty well,|sd
it's, it's like on the --|sd
Huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, our, our garages come in from the back, you know, from the alley --|sd
So do ours,|sd
yeah.|%
-- and, uh, it's, it's a little piece of land over there|sd
What did you grow?|qw
Well, I had, uh, tomatoes and, and, uh, uh, peppers,|sd
and I had,|sd
That is amazing.|ba
and by the fence I had cucumbers, which, which didn't do real well, uh --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- they kind of came out looking like gourds.|sd
Well, put them in a salad, though,|ad
and you say, well, I made it though, at least it's mine.|ad
But I had squash,|sd
I had zucchini and, and yellow crook neck squash,|sd
They tell you what our topic was?|qy
I think golf, isn't it?|qy
Right.|na
How much of a golfer are you?|qw
Are you a hacker?|qy
You bet.|na
I'm fifty years old,|sd
I've been a hacker, -|sd
I think, I think I played better golf when I was fifteen, John, than --|sd
I know I,|sd
I know I did.|sd
And, uh, -|%
Course, I know I watch my thirteen year old play now, you know,|sd
and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body.|sv
Oh, I know,|aa
it's just unreal.|sv
I, you know, I'm a guy that plays, -|sd
if I play a lot of golf, I play six to eight times a year|sd
and that's about it.|sd
I figure that's my retirement game.|sd
I really, -|%
I come from a family of golfers.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, I was raised by a man, my stepfather who, with a two handicap, I mean, he, he, he, he could get down on his knees and hit the ball, I mean, further than most people could hit it.|sd
Sure.|b
And my mother who is now, he's, my stepfather is dead, but my mother who is now seventy-one I can remember her being, I believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap,|sd
but, but, uh, all they did every day in their life was to play golf every, -|sd
they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club they belonged to back in Richmond, Virginia and just, uh, play nine holes of golf.|sd
Yeah.|b
That was their deal,|sd
they, -|%
That's what it takes,|ba
you, you need to play that often --|sv
But, uh --|sd
I have a brother-in-law who is, uh, an ex-college coach and like a pro|sd
and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf|sd
sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family.|sd
Well, I went to, -|sd
I decided this past year that I was going to get out and start playing a lot more|sd
and I, I went after it|sd
and did, and I really didn't find much improvement.|sd
Fact, ever time I'd start trying to correct something, it seemed like the score would -- *listen|sd
Oh, really?|bh
yeah,|ny
I, I --|sv
Yeah.|b
I probably need to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current --|sv
Yeah.|b
Spend more time on the, -|sv
I think I'm probably the same way.|sv
Lessons do help.|sv
I know ever year we buy, -|sd
I go to this Ducks Unlimited dinner,|sd
it's a hunter's type affair --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I buy in, in Austin, Texas, -|sd
I go down to Austin,|sd
I live in the Dallas area, but I go down to Austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we always buy this weekend at a, at a country club in the hill country.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Oh, yeah,|aa
I'm familiar with it.|sd
And we just have a ball,|sd
and we play three days in a row, three different courses|sd
and, course, believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the, uh, third course, my score has gone from, you know, a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five.|sd
So, -|%
Oh, yeah,|aa
if you play regular, I think it makes a big difference.|sd
You bet,|aa
so it, that makes a lot of difference to me.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
I, well, I've also found, too, I, I try to work out regularly|sd
and when I am doing that, uh, and feeling loose and, that I swing better,|sd
I, I, I get through the ball better.|sd
Uh, and I also, if I, -|%
I found as I've gotten a little older here, I worry less about my distance.|sd
You bet.|aa
And I, -|%
my control is a little bit better there.|sd
Yeah.|aa
Uh, so, -|%
That's super.|ba
I haven't learned to hit the ball easy|sd
and I just sort of, -|sd
I'm always wanting to hit it hard|sd
and, that's something my stepfather never could teach me, you know, just to relax and hit the ball,|sd
and, you know, so, subsequently when I do tire out from playing like twelve, fourteen holes, my, you know, a lot of my energy's gone,|sd
when I do swing it's an easier swing --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I do, actually, hit the ball better.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Have you ever, have you ever tried a one iron?|qy
No,|nn
I have a two through, you know, two through wedge.|sd
I hit a two iron awful lot.|sd
Off, now, off the tee.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't hit a driver off the tee.|sd
That, that's why I need my driving lessons.|sd
Well, you know, I put mine back in my bag this year, too,|sd
and I, I used a three wood rather than a driver.|sd
That helps.|ba
Uh, I had a lot more control on it, uh,|sd
I sacrificed distance,|sd
but I wasn't in trouble every time I got down the fairway.|sd
Well, that's, that's a good idea.|sv
I think this next year, I'm going to, I'm going to attempt to play more|sd
and I'm going to do the same thing.|sd
I, I laid off my woods about three years ago|sd
and I just use a two wood off the fairway|sd
and I'm a fairly strong person|sd
so I get a pretty good little drive --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I, and I guess control my irons, better, you know,|sd
if you'll take lessons, the first thing they put in your hand is an iron.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
absolutely.|aa
And, uh, I still remember that watching myself and my son|sd
so, but I think the key is you just need to, you need to play more often than I play.|sv
Yeah,|b
well, I, I read recently here, they say, if you're playing, if you're scoring well, you should play more.|sv
If you're scoring poorly, you should spend more time on the practice g-, --|sv
Right.|b
Uh, I think there is less flus-, frustration factor there, too, uh,|sv
Makes good, makes good sense.|ba
So, but I, I, -|%
the one iron is something I've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that I, I should pick one up and try to start.|sd
Apparently they're very difficult to play with,|sv
but with practice, I would imagine you could groove that swing, too.|sd
And I play with a fellow that can knock a one iron,|sd
it's incredible.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
And, but, and his accuracy is what's so startling with it.|sd
And I, -|%
and it, but it's an iron that he's really practiced with.|sd
He has used a lot,|sd
and, uh, it would be fun to get that good at a --|sv
You bet.|ba
My cha-, my challenge of the game is just, if I can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you, I'd be|sd
That, boy, -|%
I just, -|%
if I get off the tee box and I, and I've, you know, you know, anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight, I just want to get down and kiss the ground, you know|sd
And get away without embarrassing yourself,|bf
right|aa
Because, -|%
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Well, do you exercise regularly?|qy
There is, -|%
well, I am a school teacher.|no
Uh-huh.|b
And, us, -|%
there is, uh, uh, girl that went through our school district, I teach in Highland Park --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
to someone else in the turn that off please,|t3
I am recording. talking to speaker|t3
My husband just turned on something noisy.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Any way, uh, she comes to the school|sd
and there are a group of teachers,|sd
and we exercise --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we do it twice a week.|sd
Oh. That is good.|ba
And, uh, we do, uh, aerobics, for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes|sd
and then we do stretching --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh.|b
So it is an hour.|sd
And then my husband and I take, uh, ten mile walks, uh, as often as possible.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, not on the nights that I do aerobics,|sd
but if, if he wants to, he jogs,|sd
but I, uh, I, we take the fast walks|sd
and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so, we, we, take it seriously.|sd
We enjoy doing it.|sd
I enjoy my group at school.|sd
It is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody --|sd
Yeah.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, well I use to exercise regularly|sd
and I haven't lately|sd
Oh, oh|b
I have goofed off, I guess.|sd
Uh, I use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, I guess my job change, my husband's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more.|sd
Oh I understand that.|ba
So, uh, -|%
I have never been able to do it before.|sd
Well, the problem is that I am so tired at the end of the day,|sd
I just want to go home and not do anything.|sd
Well, I and too. I just make myself. -|sd
Yeah.|b
I get up at five thirty|sd
and I am at school at seven thirty.|sd
Oh.|b
School is not over until, uh, four --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and our class, -|sd
but it is in the building --|sd
Oh.|b
-- that is the big difference|sd
because there are other people around that, uh, -|sd
you had better hurry.|t3
Go get dressed.|t3
You know, there is motivation around there|sd
and then, uh, we, we can change right there in the building.|sd
I don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And I just go|sd
and we, uh, exercise.|sd
And until then, you know I have belonged to exercise clubs|sd
and oh I have gone to, uh, oh, like, uh, oh, these gyms, you know that the, like in Plano and Richardson and, uh, where they offer the, uh, rec centers really --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I have done that before, but it has always had to be late at night --|sd
Yeah.|b
and you are just kind of going Ugh.|sv
And I have tried it immediately after school|sd
like, try to get some place and exercise from five to six,|sd
but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late.|sv
That is right.|aa
That is right.|aa
That is a . -|sv
It is.|aa
It is really hard with our life style when you work to,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I know, some people go during lunch,|sd
but, you know by the time I get over the gym and, and go for my class and shower and get back to work, it is probably two hours or more --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and that is just too long.|sv
I have twenty-five minutes for lunch.|sd
Yeah|b
That is out for me.|sd
That doesn't really do it, does it?|qh
No,|aa
I don't think so.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, and they are nice because if we are running late, it usually, uh, -|sd
if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late, they kind of wait on us.|sd
You know, cause they know we are in the building and coming.|sd
Yeah.|b
and, uh, it does going to start whether you are there or not|sv
That is right|aa
That is right.|aa
So this has worked out real nicely.|sd
In fact, she charges us two dollars a session.|sd
Well, that is not much.|ba
Huh-uh.|aa
So it's, it's, -|%
we like pay her for six weeks at a time --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and so it is like twenty-four dollars every six weeks.|sd
Oh.|b
That is not bad.|ba
Huh-uh.|aa
It beats memberships at some of these clubs.|ba
That is for sure.|ba
You are not kidding.|ba
They are real expensive.|sv
I know.|aa
We belonged, uh, for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership --|sd
Oh.|b
-- and at first we used it|sd
and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth.|sd
Yeah.|b
And they offered lots of things,|sd
but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to.|sd
Yeah.|b
So we decided to forget that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That was just a waste of our our money.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Well we have one through work|sd
Oh no.|ba
But, I, uh, I don't know|sd
I still just don't don't end up going cause it isn't at a convenient time or I don't know something,|sd
but I need to do something.|sd
If, if its only walk the dog or something.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I need to start doing that.|sd
It does make you feel better.|sv
The hard thing is getting going.|sv
That is right.|aa
And if you have somebody who will do it with you, -|sv
like, for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to, uh, jog --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but he decided that, uh, maybe, uh, you know, -|sd
What are you guys having for Christmas?|qo
What are we having?|^h
Let's see|^h
Well, I'm not planning the menu.|sd
Oh, you're not.|bh
No|nn
We usually go out to ei-, either one of our folks,|sd
they both live close to -- -|sd
Yeah.|b
-- but, um, I don't know,|sd
it seems like a, a big thing for Christmas is usually ham.|sv
Well, funny you should mention that.|sd
I'm a pig farmer|sd
Oh, you are --|bh
Yeah.|ny
-- huh.|b
Well, now, it's kind of a hobby more than anything else,|sd
but we're going to have, uh, wild boar --|sd
My goodness.|ba
-- we, uh, we killed a boar the other day,|sd
it was, you know, mating with the sows,|sd
and you can't use the piglets, you know,|sd
so. -|%
Huh.|b
It's about six months of no use,|sd
so, we, uh, we shot him and cleaned him out and had him, you know, processed into ham,|sd
and, uh, we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig, because I, I've got one that's got a, a hernia --|sd
Oh, really.|bh
-- and rather than, you know, pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery, we'll just cook him and eat him|sd
Is that, is that hard?|qy
Well, no,|nn
hey, I tell you what, preparing a little pig is, is a snap,|sd
I'm telling you, real easy, easier than chicken.|sd
Oh, really.|bh
Yeah,|ny
you just, uh, -|%
you kill him, you know,|sd
you probably, -|%
most guys just shoot them in the head,|sd
they go, you know, -|sd
in a second they're gone --|sd
Oh.|b
-- and then you just dip the carcass in, uh, boiling water, pull it out, and there's a, we use a little raspy brush, pulls the hair off, and, uh, gut it, and, uh, just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and, uh, some pineapple, about three pineapples, you know, sliced them up, and, uh, cover him up with, uh, wet, uh, sacks, feed sacks is what I usually use -- *more than one utt??|sd
Huh.|b
Oh, my goodness.|ba
And after about six hours, you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there,|sd
and it's the best eating you ever had.|sd
Oh, well, does a boar taste just like regular ham?|qy
Yep,|ny
just like a pig --|sd
Does it.|bh
-- I mean, you know, uh, it has a lot less fat.|sd
Huh.|b
This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds --|sd
Oh my.|ba
-- and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds.|sd
Oh, my goodness.|ba
Well, you know, we took the skin and the head and the le-, and the feet off,|sd
and that was about, you know, a hundred, hundred pounds of just ham.|sd
Oh, well, how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas?|qw
Oh, well, we're, you know, we're not going to eat the whole thing|sd
Eat it all,|b^m
yeah|b
It would take a year.|sd
But, uh, you know, we're going to drive up to Kansas City, see my wife's folks,|sd
and, uh, she, she, -|%
what's, what's what's your mother cooking for Christmas|qw
yeah,|%
well her mom's doing brisket.|sd
I don't, -|sd
what is brisket?|qw
Brisket?|bh
It's a part of the cow that they used to throw away.|sd
Huh.|b
It's just tough as a boot --|sd
Oh.|b
-- and, uh, you know, they used to use it for leather, I think|sd
Oh, my goodness.|ba
I mean, no,|ar
I was kidding.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, it's, it's a part of the loin, you know, the rib cage,|sd
and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of,|sd
so it's really, really a tough piece of meat --|sd
Oh, my goodness.|ba
-- but it's so tasty, you can't stand it.|sd
Huh.|b
So you just take it|sd
and you marinate it for a couple of days --|sd
And that softens it up, huh.|bf
Huh.|b
And then, uh, you just put it in the oven,|sd
takes about four hours to cook one.|sd
They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds.|sd
Oh, gee.|ba
And, uh, we're going to have that.|sd
Well, what else do you serve with your pig?|qw
Oh, well, we'll have cranberries and hominy|sd
and, uh, we, we are, we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here.|sd
Huh.|b
We have oliv-, olives, black olives and cucumbers and, uh, tomatoes,|sd
we still have tomatoes --|sd
Oh, do you?|bh
-- yeah,|ny
fresh tomatoes.|sd
Oh, we, we just got lots of snow|sd
Well, it started to freeze up around here, you know,|sd
there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire, and half of that's down.|sd
I mean it's thirty degrees this morning.|sd
Oh, really.|bh
Yeah.|ny
Huh.|b
But, uh, it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost.|sd
Oh, my goodness.|ba
I didn't know it got that low at night.|sd
Oh, yeah.|aa
Well, it's desert, you know,|sd
where, where we are, it's, it's, it's, uh, the edge of the desert,|sd
I mean, it's part of the Great Plains.|sd
So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred, hundred and ten --|sd
Oh, gee.|ba
-- and at night it goes down to about sixty.|sd
My goodness.|ba
Yeah,|aa
we get a fifty de-, degree temperature swing in about four hours.|sd
Oh, boy.|ba
So everything that lives around here is real tough|sd
Oh|b
That's trees, you know,|sd
we got hundred year old trees that are, you know, twenty feet tall.|sd
Oh, gee.|ba
That's all the bigger they get,|sd
they, you know, they're just hard as a rock.|sd
What, what, -|%
how do you get your main source of current events?|qw
Well, uh, until recently I was taking the WALL STREET JOURNAL,|sd
and I thought that was a good way,|sd
but I have about five different magazines that I get that keeps me up on things.|sd
You know, it's a week or two late,|sd
but, uh, that's how I'm staying up.|sd
I either watch the news|sd
or, or occasionally I'll read the paper.|sd
Uh, do you like how it's presented on the news?|qy
Um, no,|nn
I think the media's a little bit too manipulative.|sv
They allow you, uh, -|sv
they, they try to lead you too much, I believe,|sv
and sometimes they're not very open,|sv
I, I don't know,|sd
I think they're a little bit biased sometimes.|sv
Like for example, the Kennedy, the Kennedy rape case.|sd
The coverage on that was, you know, -|sv
when it first happened it was, he was guilty, he was guilty, he was guilty.|sd
You know, they try to have you form opinions or whatever,|sv
and then I, I didn't like the thi-, the things that were going on when we had Desert Storm and stuff like that.|sd
You know, basically I, I, I think they don't present the, the whole sides of, of everything.|sv
So, it, it makes you feel like they're, uh, wanting you to take their opinion.|bf
Right.|aa
It's, it's, it's, instead of reporting the news, it's more like an editorial, I believe --|sd
Yeah.|b
I've noticed that too,|sd
and it's kind of distressing, isn't it?|qy
Yeah.|ny
And they just, I've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words, uh, usually, uh, just that sway the whole, uh, report that, you know, by just a couple of words.|sv
Well, when, when I was in school, I, um, I was a communications major,|sd
so I, I, I'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking, and, and so forth|sd
So, communications, huh.|bf
Were you looking into becoming a reporter|qy
or, -|%
I was,|na
and, um, I we-, I ventured off in a whole entire different field, field.|sd
I went with the state.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I, um, went with the Department of State Treasurer in retirement disability,|sd
calculate benefits.|sd
I bet that's a interesting job.|ba
Yeah.|aa
So the, -|%
so, and, you know, working, you know, working for state government you hear all about current events, about things going on within the state itself.|sd
So that, that's another source that I, I, where I keep up with current events|sd
and, -|%
Yeah,|b
there's one that I'm reading right now.|sd
It's INFORMATION WEEK.|sd
It says A T and T to account for the, the benefits that the A I C P A now says you have to show as a liability.|sd
It's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety-three,|sd
It's a lot of money.|ba
And it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more.|sd
It's a lot of money.|ba
Yeah,|aa
it is.|sd
And, yeah, you have to stay up on stuff,|sv
and I bet in your, your job that you have to,|sd
do you read the WALL STREET JOURNAL?|qy
No,|nn
well, no,|nn
I, I, I primarily deal with the state employees,|sd
but I, I find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the, like the state of North Carolina's budget, and stuff like that.|sd
And I really know what the budget is,|sd
and, and, uh, uh, when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes, and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that,|sd
and, you know, I'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has,|sd
and it, it's just funny.|sv
You know, so that's, that's, that's, -|%
so I don't have a whole lot of faith in, in, you know, the news.|sd
Course it's, -|%
they, they get what they hear from, -|sv
but, you know, it's not always I, I think one hundred percent reliable.|sv
Can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective?|qo
I think they need to do a little bit, go into a little bit more depth, uh, before they would just report, like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that,|sv
because I mean, another example is the, uh, AIDS issue or whatever.|sd
You know, someone said, Oh, I found a cure.|sd
They immediately, -|%
the headlines on the news or whatever is, Someone says they found a cure for AIDS.|sd
And then two months later it's discovered it's not, you know,|sd
before they, before they come out with something like that they need to, to research the matter, I believe, a little bit more.|sd
I guess they do that so they don't get scooped, you know,|sv
so they have the big story.|sv
Well, that, -|%
well, yeah|aa
I, I, -|%
it, -|%
I think the, -|%
Let's see, *something missing? A.1?|^h
my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,|sd
but, I, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for Halloween and Christmas,|sd
but basically he does all the heavy stuff,|sd
and I do all the fun stuff|sd
Well, we have it just opposite here.|sd
My wife works in, you know, at, at, at the T I,|sd
and she's, uh, sedentary all day long --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I see.|b
And we have about ten acres,|sd
and she tries --|sd
Wow.|ba
Wow. That's a, a big job.|ba
Well, yeah,|aa
it keeps, uh, well, -|%
it's doing real well,|sd
because when we got this place the, the dirt was just overgrazed --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- I mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and now, you know, since we've been mowing it, -|sd
and, you know, of course we water a little bit,|sd
that's just too much to water all at once,|sd
but --|sd
Oh, sure.|ba
Oh, I bet it's beautiful.|ba
Yeah,|aa
but we don't do much in the way of, uh, flowers.|sd
We have one little flower garden --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
The rest of it is just like wild flowers --|sd
Wild flowers.|b^m
-- and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They're about, oh, I guess, a third the size of your, palm of your hand --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and --|sd
Oh, that sounds lovely.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, the wild flowers are beautiful.|sv
I think, um, I was thinking about throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets|sd
or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty.|sd
Then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved.|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
Well, my wife and I really enjoy that sort of thing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, she enjoys mowing.|sd
I can't believe it.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
I know a lot of -- -|sd
I mean, I hate it|sd
-- uh-huh,|b
a lot of women do. Um,|sd
I've just never really, you know, -|sd
maybe one of these days I'll have to get out there and mow,|sd
but, um, my husband takes it on,|sd
and I'll help rake up the grass,|sd
and, um, sometimes I'll help him edge, um,|sd
because, we don't have that much property,|sd
but we're on a corner lot,|sd
so there's a lot of edging to do --|sd
Right.|b
-- and, um, uh, that's what's nice about living more in the country,|sv
you don't have to worry about any of that|sv
We don't even have any concrete --|sd
Oh.|b
Oh, that's nice,|ba
I, -|%
this is different for us because the other, -|sd
in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks,|sd
and, um, it's been a little more country with the trees,|sd
and we do miss that.|sd
Um, if we had a chance to move, I think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah --|b
-- but, you know, we do everything together.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
This, this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the, -|sd
actually this fall, I was talking about, -|sd
two weeks ago --|sd
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, we're in the process of, of planting --|sd
Wow that's, -|ba
-- and we're building a stand, uh, just to the north of our house, and along the east, uh, property line --|sd
Um.|b
-- and I, uh, I think what we're, what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
So. -|%
Right.|b
Well, I put, -|%
On the other side of the house, though, that's where we have all the, the delicate flowers and the mums,|sd
and we have morning glory --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers,|sd
and we planted those out by the septic, so that, uh, they get plenty of water --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we get hummingbirds come in the --|sd
Oh.|b
Oh, that sounds so pretty.|ba
And, well, when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house.|sd
Oh really|ba
Do they, don't do any damage, though,|qy^d
they just fly right back out, if you have the, -|qy^d
Well, yeah,|ny
they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat --|sd
I see.|ba
-- and when you're as busy as one of those babies, you've got to eat most of the time.|sd
I see.|b
And we got a few, you know,|sd
we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, you know, for the most part, gardening for us is, -|sd
well, we got asparagus,|sd
and, uh, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Man, we get the best strawberries, that you just can't believe.|sd
Oh, oh, that sounds wonderful.|ba
We just got our last tomatoes.|sd
Oh, I love home gro-, grown tomatos.|ba
Yeah.|aa
There's nothing like them.|sv
They just don't have the same ones in the supermarket|sv
Well, these are accidental tomatos.|sd
What does that mean, accidental tomatoes?|qw
Well, last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes,|sd
of course you're going to lose some that way --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and the seeds go right through them.|sd
I see.|b
And wherever they pooped, -|sd
favorite type of music or musician or any. -|qo
I don't really have a favorite type.|sd
I like, uh, a lot of different types of music.|sd
Do you?|bh
Yeah,|ny
I have a, a tape collection that I like to listen to, uh, cassette tapes --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but it's pretty varied.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
How about you?|qo
Oh, I, I'm very, uh, I'm very varied as well.|sd
I, uh, I don't think I've ever met a type of music I don't like except for, uh, maybe, you know, heavy metal and that.|sd
That's exactly me.|sd
The acid rock or the heavy metal.|sd
Yeah.|b
Even some of that I like okay --|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't care for that at all.|sd
Yeah.|aa
I don't enjoy rap too much, either.|sd
That, that doesn't appeal to, uh, my ears.|sd
Well, as far as the rap goes, I think there are a few artists that appeal to me --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I like some of their songs.|sd
Oh.|bk
But as, as -|%
I agree, with the general rule, I, I wouldn't choose rap either.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But I, I like to listen to, uh, what you might call pop, easy listening --|sd

I, I don't, -|%
I like, uh, like I said, pretty varied, uh, music.|sd

I have a couple that my husband really hates --|sd

-- and, uh, I even have a, a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo --|sd
Oh, gosh.|ba
-- and, well, I mean, they're very harmonic --|sv
Uh-huh --|b
-- they really are.|sv

yeah,|b
sure.|ba
So, they're interesting to listen to.|sv
You might try that.|ad
How about you?|qo
Well, um, I listen to, uh, specific, -|sd
most, most likely I would be listen to, uh, jazz or classical music.|sd
Um I, in college I took, uh, four years of classical guitar,|sd
and I played in the, in the jazz combo all four years.|sd
I play guitar --|sd
Oh, yeah?|bh
So, uh, that's where my two, my two listening enjoyments are,|sd
but, you know, jazz can get on my nerves after a while.|sd
Uh, you can't just listen to it, you know, to, uh, especially a lot of the deeper stuff,|sv
It's too, um, uh, -|%
you have to concentrate on it, it seems.|bf
it just, it just doesn't do anything.|sv
What about the blues or something like that?|qw
Uh, uh, blues are okay.|sv

No,|nn

Um, some of it sounds more like pop music.|sv

Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b

Um, oh, I like sound tracks a lot.|sd
Oh, do you?|bh
Yeah,|ny
it seems like you get a lot of original music that way.|sv
Yeah,|aa
you sure do.|sv
I mean, you know, think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
-- things like that I like to listen to.|sd
Um, I like instrumental things.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I have some Spiro Gyro tapes.|sd
Oh, they're great aren't they.|ba
Oh, they're wonderful.|aa
Yeah.|b
I love them.|sd
I have some dulcimer music.|sd

Al Jarreau, he's somebody I like.|sd
He's pretty, kind of jazz inspired but --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|aa
I like his, -|sd
he has a nice smooth voice.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
and, you know, what I like the most about him, is, I've gone to see him in concert, and he always, he looks like he's having fun.|sv
Yeah,|b
sure.|b
I mean, some people sing,|sv
and they have their faced all contorted,|sv
But he looks like he's having a good time.|sv
I mean, he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy --|sd
Uh-huh.|b

And he, he is real fun to listen to.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, Bonnie Rait, I like her a lot.|sd

Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES?|qy
Yeah.|ny
I've seen that,|sd
that's, uh, that was a really good movie.|sv
Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery|sv

I, I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it.|sv
Have you ever lived in that part of the country?|qy
No.|nn
I haven't.|sd
Have you ever visited it?|qy
Um, I've visited the Wyoming area.|no
I'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed.|sd

Well, I lived in Omaha for five,|no
Oh.|b
Okay.|bk
and that rolling kind of, uh, -|sd
Terrain.|^2
Yeah.|aa
Is, is fairly famili-, . -|sd
The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics, -|sv
apparently it's going to win everything.|sv
Really?|bh
Uh, and I had been told, you know, you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long, and all this,|sd
That's true.|aa
I agree with that.|aa
Um, I, I noticed yesterday in the paper, something said that it, -|sd
I think it's been nominated for twelve awards|sd
and, and all the critics initially said that, you know, it wouldn't go anywhere, that it was just going to be a dud.|sd
So, it, it has surprised everybody.|sv
Well, the interesting thing was is I had heard that,|sd
and I, I, I tend to, I think, overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great.|sd
And, and --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|aa
And, and, and I guess that's what I really like.|sd
Although, I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour.|sd

I've heard, I've heard that's really great, though.|sd
Y-, you have to go see that one.|sv

No,|nn
Go.|ad
You must really keep up.|sv
I do.|aa
I go every weekend|sd
I, I, uh, -|%
those are two definite must see movies, I think.|sv
Well, isn't, isn't SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, isn't that a, -|%
i-, is it, is it a terror movie|qy
or is it just suspenseful?|qy
It's suspenseful.|sd
I don't think it's very t-, -|%
I mean, there's not really any, uh, blood and guts in it or anything like that.|sd
It's, it's more suspense.|sd
Um, the other one, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, is kind of a, a gory movie, if, if somebody's not into that kind of stuff.|sd
It's, it's pretty graphic at points.|sd
But, uh, I think they're both excellent movies.|sv
Do you, do you listen to Gary Cogill?|qy
No. Huh-uh. *two utts|nn
Is, uh, -|%
do you know who he is?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Somebody in South Carolina told me about him.|sd
He's a, the movie critic.|sd
Um, oh, you've, oh, -|%
okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
He's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas.|sd
Yeah.|b
And he does, uh, he has a talk show on the, K L I F.|sd
Anyway, it's on from seven to nine, or something.|sd
And, and, and people call in|sd
and it's, if you keep up with movies, it's kind of interesting.|sv
There's a certain a mount of dribble that they do.|sv
They've got, uh, they've got a couple of kids, ten or twelve years old,|sd
and they call in|sd
and they review movies.|sd
But it's, uh -- -|%
Oh.|b

it's interesting.|sd
You listen to him|sd

In fact, they had, people had just seen, -|%
I was listening Sunday night a little bit when,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, anyway, it was, uh, the, -|%
it, it's interesting, though,|sv
or did he just do it?|qy
I think that, I think he really, -|%
his heart was in it,|sv
but I, I don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was.|sv
I think it was something that he really wanted to do.|sv
He wanted to direct it,|sv
he wanted to, to star in it.|sv
You know, he, he enjoyed the story line|sv
and I think he just really w-, he really wanted it.|sv
And whether it, whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office, I think he would have been happy.|sv
Because I think that, I think he did a good job|sv
and, and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him.|sv
Do you know who the guy was that was playing the, uh, the, the wagon driver?|qy

So, and how do you feel about it?|qo
Uh, I'm, I am a person who wishes I had more time to exercise.|sd
I,|%
I don't very often do things for the sake of exercise.|sd
I don't feel well unless I am exercising|sd

but, I very rarely do things like, um, -|sd
I've never done aerobics or any sort of structured,|sd
this is my exercise time --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, I do lots of outdoor sports and things, bicycling, uh, you know, mountaineering, a little mountaineering, this and that,|sd
and I spend a lot of time|sd
and I probably get more exercise than your average person.|sv
But, it's not a, a structured sort of thing,|sd
and I have to admit I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and perhaps, it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun, or something like that.|sv
Yeah,|b
well I, I've, -|%
my, -|%

Uh-huh.|b
Yes,|aa
yes.|aa
and, and, she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore.|sd

Yeah,|aa
and it's, and it's more regulated,|sd

an-, and it's structured like that,|sv

Uh-huh.|b
And, someone else is telling me, okay, you know, let's move this way, let's move that way,|sd
Uh-huh,|b

Um, there's been some progressive medical schools out here,|sd
Uh-huh|b
And, um, -|%
Now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health, that, the, you know, you have to have that combination, or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program.|qy
Boy,|^h
Do you think the program came first or the, -|qy
yeah,|ny
that, -|%
there's a, -|%
I, I can say there's a correlation, but I couldn't say which, which caused the other.|sv
They sort of, dev-, you know, each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more, and a little bit more.|sv
Yeah,|aa
the more money they put into it.|sv
Yeah.|aa
And, -|%
I can see that.|bk
And, cause, I, -|%
knowing -|%
from institutes of learning like that, I know that they've got to get their money somewhere,|sd
and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it, and believe in it,|sd
so, -|%
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Exactly.|aa
And, part of it is California,|sv
and some of them fizzled out|sd
and some of them were disastrous|sd
and others of them, um, had an impact on the society around here.|sd
And one of the ones that had an impact was, uh, people becoming interested in alternate practices,|sv
I'm not sure if it was a meditation practice, or if it was, you know, which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to, uh, A M A approved medicine.|sv
Uh, you have, you know, major, um, acupuncture schools and things out here.|sd
And, and you could have them around long enough|sv
and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and, before long, you, you get this, this whole kind of Gestalt, this whole package of, of health, of health care and options --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, and exercise is, is strongly considered one of them.|sd
The irony is, is its people in the cities, in my experience, that are most oriented towards doing the exercise.|sv
And, I guess because they spend all day in back of their desks.|sv
The average person out on the farm, at least traditionally, now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything --|sv
Yeah.|b
last thing, -|%
Or they're older.|sv
Pardon me.|br
Well, don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar-. -|sv
I, I sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city.|sv
Oh, like everything else.|bf
I live in a rural area,|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
The rat race to exercise|bf
It's, yeah, it's, it's like it's frantic, to,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|aa
well I,|sv
as a fit person|sd
I mean you, you've, -|%
if you look at cert-, if you look at other cultures, -|sd
like I know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in China|sd
and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all.|sd
But, they do a lot of low keyed, low impact, low stress exercise,|sd
and they combine it with a, you know, meditation or whatever. Some sort of relaxation --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, they seem pretty, you know, -|sv
they don't have the hard body.|sv
They don't have that perfect look,|sv
and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious.|sv
But they, you know, they live to a hundred and ten some you know,|sv
Yeah,|b
And, that, that's, -|%
Well, don't you think a lot of that is diet too?|sv
and, a lot of that is diet.|sv
That's true.|aa
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I mean, they eat, they eat a lot of carbohydrates, and not much fat.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, -|%
Yeah|b
and as we can see. -|%
Well, I'm a, I'm a practicing vegetarian|sd
so, uh, I've read a lot of information, knowing that to be true,|sd
Yeah|b
am I actually. -|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
What's that?|br
I, as am I.|sd
Oh, are you also|qy
Yes|ny
Well that's, that's good as far as the cal-, -|sv
is that, is that, um, pretty predominant as far as California do-, doe-, -|qy
It is in the urban areas,|sd
yes.|ny
In the urban areas?|qy
Most, for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh that's wonderful.|ba
Well most, most, mo-, sort of modern looking restaurants will,|sd
Yeah.|b
you can, -|%
That's great,|ba
I mean, we, uh, -|%
it's such a chor-, it's such a trouble here.|sd
I mean, you just have to eat at home basically.|sd
I was wondering that,|sd
because I was actually applying for a job in Texas,|sd
and, and, and, uh,|sd
Well of course in the cities, -|sv
yeah,|b
well, in the cities, -|%
we live close to Dallas,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so, uh, which, you know, -|%
you get, uh, an influx of a lot of people from all over the country,|sv
so,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
but,|%

All righty .|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Uh, I'll just hand it off to you|sd

Well, uh, the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time, are crafts|sd

It's really kind of fun.|aa
It is.|aa
It really is.|aa
Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty,|sv
yeah.|%
Yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
I like things that, you know, two people can do,|sd
but I like the quiet of doing things away, you know,|sd
kind of gives you some space for yourself,|sv
and that's what I find in making the dolls and things, that it gives me something that I can create,|sd
and I like to crochet and knit.|sd
I made some afghans and that kind of stuff.|sd
I like doing things with my hands.|sd
Uh-huh.|b

I play a lot of racquetball.|sd
We did, I did horseback riding, too,|sd
in fact, when my children were growing up, we always had horses|sd
and, uh, that was kind of for them,|sd
but they weren't as interested in it as we were, you know,|sd
so, uh, that was a real, -|sd
I'd say probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know,|sd
we always had horses around,|sd
and I really enjoyed that,|sd
Oh, that's great,|ba
sounds like you, -|sv
and I was disappointed when I went to Texas.|sd
I didn't see that many of them.|sd
Horses?|br
Yes|aa
Yeah,|aa
you really don't.|sv
Yeah,|%
th-, the, -|%
you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete, uh,|sv
I know,|aa
I know,|aa
it's true.|aa
there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people|sv
and that's about it down here,|sv
and so, -|%
Uh-huh.|b

But, uh, that's great.|ba
Well, sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there.|sv
Yeah,|b
you too,|sv
you too.|sv
Well, great,|ba
well look, uh,|^h
I know it's probably late for you,|sv
Okay.|b
I enjoyed speaking with you --|fc
Me too.|fc
-- have a good weekend.|fc
Okay.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye, now.|fc
Well, the thing is, is that I, um, -|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
since I'm in school I don't, like, basically have a monthly budget because I'm living off my dad,|sd
but the thing is, is that, um, I have to keep it under control because, for example, you know, it's like the, the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything, everything is pretty rough,|sd
but he controls that part|sd
but, then whenever, you know, -|%
it's like, once the semester starts I'm the one who has to control how much spending there is.|sd
And the only thing that I, I basically spend my money on is just food|sd
and, um, so, -|%
What about tuition and rent?|qw
Who takes care of that?|qw
Well, the thing is, is that I live in a dorm.|sd
Uh.|b
So, uh, what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts.|sd
Yeah.|b
And then the tuition is also the same thing.|sd
So, the thing is, is basically that I spend, like, maybe thirty-five, forty dollars every two weeks on, on groceries|sd
and that's about it.|sd
But the thing, uh, also is that, you know, like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something, then I have to moderate that because it's like I can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars, um, you know, three times a week.|sd
No,|aa
you can't do that very often.|sv
So, I mean, it's, -|%
for, for us, you know, it's like, I, I can spend, I can spend that money|sd
but it's not, it's not what I want to spend it on, you know.|sd
Are, are you working anywhere while you are going to school?|qy
No.|nn
Okay.|bk
Because, um, they don't allow me to work since, uh, I'm a foreign student.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
And so they, the government doesn't allow me to work.|sd
Yeah,|b
so all the money comes from home.|bf
Uh-huh.|aa
So, you got to make, uh, -|bf
so how do you keep track of where you are in, in your monthly spending?|qw
Well, the thing is, is that, um, I ba-, I basically know how much I have, right?|qy
Right.|na
And so, the thing is, is that I, I can tell like, uh, -|%
I, I get all my money out of the teller.|sd
Yeah.|b
And besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since I have to call, you know, international.|sd
Where do you call to?|qw
Argentina.|sd
Argentina?|br
Yeah.|aa
Wow.|ba
And so the bas-, -|%
one of the problems is that I spend too much money on phone bills.|sd
Yeah,|aa
talk too long.|bf
Well, that's, -|%
they, they want me to call down there every so often.|sd
Yeah.|b
I mean, I told my dad, li-, Dad listen if you want to save money I won't call so often, you know,|sd
he goes, we want to keep in touch|sd
so I doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you.|^q
Yeah,|b
so you call him collect?|qy
No.|nn
Because it is more expensive that way.|sd
What makes you ,|qo
Any, any, um, -|%
basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, um, because it's considered a luxury in other countries.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
So, you just call him direct|bf
and then, -|%
Right.|aa
Since it's his money anyway, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
And he gets the, and you get the bill and send it to him?|qy
No.|nn
Um, I got money to pay that, too.|sd
Okay.|bk
So, it's basically, you know, -|%
it's like, it's not too much money,|sd
and it's not too little money,|sd
so --|sd
Yeah.|b
because, um, he really wants me to concentrate on my studies.|sd
Yeah.|b
What are you, what are you studying?|qw
I'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering.|sd
And what do you think you'll do with that?|qo
With those degrees?|bf
Uh-huh.|aa
Well, I can, I can work up, um, here up to a year.|sd
And?|qo
And hopefully get a job after that.|sd
You want to get into some kind of manufacturing,|qy
or what's the specialty that your looking for?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Um, computer communications and data transmissions.|sd
Oh, okay,|bk
so you want to find a, uh, data transmissions, -|qy^d
you're looking for, uh, um, long distance --|qy^d
Right.|na
Yeah,|ny
you know, anywhere from, um, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, you know, all that,|sd
and so, well, you have a family, right?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I have a wife and two children|sd
and, um, -|%
And does, does your wife work?|qy
No.|nn
She doesn't work,|sd
she does, uh, -|sd
well, it's kind of hard to say now days, um, other than taking care of the house, she does a lot of sewing herself.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
And she gets paid for that|sd
so she brings some money in.|sd
Yeah.|b
She is trying to start he-, her own business where she does that full time.|sd
Okay.|b
Yeah.|b
and, uh, do that on a, on a full time basis here in town.|sd
And so, and you have a monthly budget?|qy
Well, s-, sort of.|no
We're probably like most Am-, American families, I guess, that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month,|sd
Right.|b
and we know what bills have to be paid,|sd
and, uh, we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with, with the monthly budget,|sd
so. -|%
So, you don't have any problem in, um, overcharging on your credit card, and stuff like that.|qy^d
Oh sure.|na
We're like everybody else, you know,|sv
we've got a, several credit cards that sometimes, um, instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
You know, that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff.|sv
Well then, uh, see, uh, that's, that's one of the points which I don't see,|sd
like I, I don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas|sd
and I, you know, I don't wa-, I don't like to give any at all --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- because the thing is, is that, you know, it's like if I want something I'll, I'll ask somebody, you know,|sd
Yeah.|b
like, like, uh, for Chr-, uh, for Christmas my roommate goes, what do you want.|sd
And I said, I want a backpack.|sd
Yeah.|b
You kno-, no,|%
I told him yo-, if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's something that you can use.|sv
Right,|aa
because I, I needed a backpack.|sd
So, he gave me a backpack,|sd
and I, I knew he needed an alarm clock.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, I bought him an alarm clock.|sd
So,|%
Right,|aa
but -- -|%
Necessary things , no frivolous gifts.|bf
-- right,|aa
but, um, the thing is, especially remember when I was down in Argentina it was, to me it was ridiculous,|sv
because you know, you have to, -|sv
once a year you go out|sv
and you spend all this money on all these people,|sv
and some you don't care about, you know,|sv
it's like, -|sv
That's true,|aa
why bother.|bf
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
And so, but the thing is, is, that, um. -|%
Well, especially being a college student yo-, your, -|sv
I don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving, you know,|sv
Yeah.|b
that effects the budget especially around, uh, Christmas time|sv
at the end of the semester you've got finals and lots of bills I would suspect.|qy^d
Yeah.|aa
What about when you have breaks like, um, Christmas or between sessions?|qw
Well, for example, we had spring break now,|sd
and I went skiing|sd
and I spent around like, maybe, two hundred dollars.|sd
I expect so.|ba
So, uh, but you know, its like, um. -|%
You've got to budget that though.|sv
You've got to save up in able to do that, right?|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
I mean, -|%
Because it's like, you know, say, you know, it's like, we were saying, let's go eat out before spring break.|sd
I go, let's not go eat out,|sd
Let's see how much money we have afterwards.|^q
Right, .|b
And if I felt like I spent way to much then, um, I won't go out, you know,|sv
Right.|b
and so, like my roommate went home,|sd
I went skiing in, over the Carolina Mountains which aren't anything,|sd
Huh.|b
but, um, but it was, you know, it was, I guess it was worth it,|sv
Sure it is,|ba
any time you can get away, and, and,|sv
You know, it was a nice place.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
especially if you live on campus, and you don't have a car, you just go crazy.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I know the feeling.|sd
So, oh well, let's see how long have we been talking here|qw
six minutes and a half.|sd
Okay.|fc
Is that okay?|fc
Yeah.|fc
All right.|fc
All right.|fc
Well, nice talking to you.|fc
Nice talking to you.|fc
Have a good time.|fc
All right.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
Well, do you think, uh, -|%
I mean I wonder, -|%
the assumption is that it is a problem, uh,|sv
and I've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem, though I have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem|sd
and, uh, but it's not clear to me that it is.|sd
Uh, bo-, -|%
Um, it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically, or in terms of their opinions.|sv
But if those who don't vote, if you made them vote -|sv
and, it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way, you know, in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other, just like everyone who did vote, it's not clear to me that it is really a problem, um.|sv
Um, that's, that's interesting,|ba
because I had thought, -|%
I ha-, feel that it's a problem also,|sd
but, I see your point on that.|aa
I mean, I, I assume that those who don't vote, -|%
I mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote, they tend to be, you know, -|sv
poor blacks, for example, vote very little, and things like that|sv
and I assume that they would vote differently if they were voting, than your average voter.|sv
But I don't know if that's the case.|^h
Uh.|b
In fact I've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't.|sd
Apparently they don't think it's a problem|sv
Uh, I guess not,|aap_am
I'm, I, I vote religiously,|sd
I really do.|sd
Um, I guess, I guess I'm a fan of democracy|sd
and, uh, wish I could vote on more things frankly.|sd
That's right, um,|aa
But it's funny because here in California things are getting, uh, increasingly democratically oriented, in, in the sense of people being able to vote for things.|sd
I mean, we have these initiatives, state initiatives now.|sd
Oh.|b
The first really popular, you know wide spread one was, uh, Proposition Thirteen which was a, uh, tax revolt,|sd
Right,|bk
I r-, -|%
Uh, and, you know, now we're, -|%
and that was whatever, ten years ago|sd
and now we're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or something like that.|sd
I mean, we've just, -|%
there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked, being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals|sd
and you had to vote for, you know, yes or no on each of them|sd
and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them|sd
and it was incredibly complicated and difficult.|sd
And a lot of people revolted against that,|sd
they said we don't want to have to decide all these things,|sd
you know, that's, that's, that's why we hire people who, uh, you know, to, to make these decisions for us.|sv
I, I kind of feel the opposite, though.|sv
Yeah.|b
I wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things.|sd
I do t-, -|aa
I think our elected officials say they are speaking for us|sv
but they're not speaking for me.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
Yeah,|aa
I wouldn't mind having, oh, more votes than I get to have, frankly|sd
That's true.|aa
Anyone who doesn't vote, it's fine with me as long as I can have their vote.|sd
That would make me happy though.|sd
Maybe not in a, in a deep philosophical sense, but in a selfish sense, it probably would.|sd
I don't know,|h
it's interesting, uh, some countries voting is obligatory.|sd
Uh, it is in Australia, for example.|sd
Is that true?|br
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
I didn't know that,|sd
I was think-, -|%
that is one solution to it.|sv
I don't know how I feel about that.|sd
But I don't, -|%
that's not really democratic. Not what I'd consider truly democratic.|sv
Well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States.|sd
As, -|%
uh-huh.|b
And it's not for me to say that they're not.|h
Uh-huh.|b
Um, they, they feel, -|%
I mean here you have the right to vote|sd
and they simply define it as a duty there.|sd
You know, we have, just as we have a r-, a duty to pay taxes, you know,|sd
is that democratic?|qh
I mean, we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country,|sd
we have the duty to pay taxes.|sd
It's a duty, right.|aa
And in that country it's a duty to pay taxes|sd
and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent.|sd
And it's not clear to me that, that's so much less democratic.|sv
Um.|h
Uh-huh.|b
but part of me rebels against that,|sd
I, it's, that's,|qy
but then I'm an American.|sd
Yeah.|ny
And some people don't vote,|sd
I mean there is -|%
like three or four percent of Australians don't vote|sd
and I think they're el-, eligible for a fine.|sd
I don't know if they actually are fined or, or what happens,|h
but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's interesting.|ba
I have people here that I know that have never registered to vote.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I think, I think they feel they can criticize if they don't|sv
Yeah,|b
I was sort of, s-, -|%
I told them if they don't vote they don't have the right to criticize.|sd
Well I, -|%
that's how I feel.|sd
I mean, if yo-, if you vote and your guy looses well you leas-, you least tried|sv
and you can say something|sv
but if you don't vote, I sort of feel like, part of me, and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like, well if you didn't vote, you get what's coming to you, you know.|sv
That's right,|aa
I feel th-, -|%
And certainly that's true in the overall,|sv
I mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole,|sv
I sort of feel that way. When they especially when someone, they, they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for, or something like that. *listen: two utts?|sv
And, you know, I say well, you know, voting for the lesser of two evils is still important.|sv
I think it is too.|aa
Sometimes it is a difficult choice.|sv
You don't feel as though you have much of a choice,|sv
but -|%
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
I mean, you, I mean, it's, it's funny because technically you do.|sv
I mean you have the right to do a write in candidate.|sd
But of course that's, that's not really a vote.|sv
Um.|%
It doesn't really gain anything.|sv
Yes,|aa
it rea-, really doesn't,|aa
and so it's, it's a complicated situation,|sv
but I would like to see, -|%
I don't know,|h
I, I, I'm, I'm thinking of actually moving to Australia|sd
and,|sd
Is that goin-, -|%
I mean, not because of the vo-, I mean I'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting,|sd
Not be-, -|%
Oh, I see.|bk
And, uh, I, -|%
I'm inte-, are you a T I employee, I'm interested.|qy
No,|nn
I'm not.|sd
Not,|b^m
okay,|bk
I just wondered.|h
And, uh, so I'm, I'm really quite, quite curious, how that would work, to have both, I mean, you know,|sd
and I believe in the, in a certain, uh, -|%
Soviet bloc countries you are, are obliged to vote too.|sv
In fact, it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for, up until fairly recently|sv
and, that's what I think of when I think of you're obliged to vote.|sd
But when you actually, really are given as much choice as you are in this country, with its two party system, um,|sv
I don't know,|h
I kind of, -|%
part of me is wary|sd
and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty, um.|sd
Well, uh, maybe they should, -|sv
perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
and perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Well that's a thought,|ba
or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have,|sv
I don't know.|h
The right to write your, -|%
Maybe it should go with a driver's license|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's, see that's an example of a right, not a, not a, -|sv
actually -|arp_nd
that's considered a privilege, not a right.|sv
That is a privilege,|sv
right,|aa
tha-, -|%
Yeah,|b
but technically people, most people, -|%
technically it's a privilege,|sd
but most people think of it as a right.|sd
I mean, in other words if the government denies you driving, denies you a driver's license, people get very upset.|sd
But actually it's a privilege,|sv
It is.|aa
That's correct.|aa
And, fortunately voting isn't that.|sv
Maybe it should, maybe it should be.|sv
Except, well except if you're a felon,|sd
if you're a felon it is taken away from you.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, they will take away your right to vote, under certain circumstances.|sd
That's right.|aa
Um, so, gosh,|^h
so we don't have a great solution yet do we|sv
Don't have a great -|b^m
I, I think I checked that as a question I'd be willing to discuss too|sd
Oh.|%
But I, I also, I also, I don't know if you've, uh, read any of the, um, oh, what do they call those. The, uh, the early republican, uh, republic documents, uh, when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people.|qy^d
No,|nn
no,|nn
I haven't.|sd
Um, oh, Hamilt-, I think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something, where he was arguing for a republican, not in the sense of the Republican party now,|sd
Right.|b
Where he defines dep-, democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues.|sd
In other words, you vote for representatives.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And the whole idea was, um, presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person, and, and, a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy,|sd
Because just as you can have a tyranny of a single, um, you know, bad ruler or something, you can have a tyranny of the majority.|sd
And, uh, he makes a very, uh, passionate, good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process,|sd
because anytime you have a majority, um, they can change the law in a democ-, a fully democratic process|sd
and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case. Um,|sd
oh, you know, a candi-, -|%
if there's some minority that people don't like because of, you know, racial hatred or something like that, the majority can just simply vote again-, vote against them.|sd
Right.|b
And cases like that, he argues, need to be constrained,|sd
and, and actually I agree, except that I don't trust the people who are appointed to vote|sd
Sometimes I think we have that right now, with Congress.|sv
Yeah,|aa
well, I, I mean, I feel that, I feel that wa-, -|sd
I think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country.|sv
Yeah,|b
well their job is to be reelected, by in large,|sv
and, so they work on that job.|sv
And there's also an antigovernment mood in the country, you know, where government is misspending your dollars|sv
and, and they're all fools,|sv
and you know, throw, throw the bastards out,|sv
that kind of thing.|sv
Right.|b
And, there's a notion that somehow, if someone isn't as much as a government person, they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange,|sv
because, I mean, if I'm hiring a plumber, I want a real plumber,|sv
I want someone trained in, -|%
Well, uh, what what do you think about the metric system?|qo
Uh, do you, uh, find it useable?|qy
Have you tried much with it?|qy
Well, wi-, with an engineering,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
because, uh, -|%
To use you mean,|bf
uh-huh.|b
yeah,|aa
if, if somebody ha-, is totally unfamiliar with it, uh, human nature being what it is we don't like to change.|sv
Yes.|aa
Uh, it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal.|sd
Yes.|b
And it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
We, -|%
well I've lived both in the United States and, and in a country where they do use the metric system|sd
and, uh, so I've, I've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over.|sd
Um, the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and,|sv
Right.|aa
That's right.|aa
and, I think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute, an inch is two point fifty-four centimeters,|sv
Right.|b
how on earth am I every going to do the math? *spelling|^q
Right.|b
And the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no, a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail, or whatever, and, you know, and leaving it at that|sv
and, uh, you know, a kilogram weighs about this much|sd
and get used to it from scratch,|sv
cause I still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters|sd
but I'm perfectly comfortable using either.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I think the real problem with this, this weird conversion, yo-, you see signs that say fifty-five miles per hour and, you know, whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour, you know, -|sv
people, you know, -|%
it's hard to take it seriously.|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
And as long as both were given, you, basically, just don't read the kilometers per hour,|sd
you just say, well look read the miles per hour one,|sd
the other one must be for someone else.|^q
That's right.|aa
Uh, I don't know,|h
I mean even Britain has converted over|sd
and we inherited this mess from them|sd
and, uh, -|%
That's right,|aa
it's all their fault.|sv
Well, I mean, it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they, they saw the light, um,|sv
I don't know why they we-, um, were more able than we were|%
except I think, that they probably just said well, we're just going to start using the things now|sv
and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to|sv
Of course, being part of the European community, if everybody else did it they, they were probably much more, -|%
is much more necessary for them than for us.|sv
That's true,|aa
that's, that's probably true|aa
and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting, you know, some other model.|sd
There's an expression for that,|sd
With eyes on the past, backing confidently into the future.|^q
I've never heard that one,|sd
that's very nice|ba
Oh, so I'm all for the metric system and converting over|sv
and I think, -|%
I guess, my feeling is the way to do it is, is to just start giving weights, you know, have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers, er, just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and, uh, just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert.|sv
Remember me getting a package of something that said one pound,|sd
this is a package of dates mind you,|sd
it's, was, presumably something you weigh fairly precisely,|sd
it said one pound|sd
and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
And, as near as I could tell, seeing that was basically anti-metric propaganda|sd
cause anyone who would say, well look I can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty-four point six grams which, of course, they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway, um,|sd
every time I see something like that I think, well, that's, that's an anti-metric argument.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, uh, I, I don't think it'll, it could ever happen with, with a quick transition.|sv
You don't?|qy
No.|nn
I, I think that would be the easiest way|sv
but human nature being such as it is,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
oh, oh, that's what I was thinking by quick transition,|sd
I didn't mean, you know, I didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything, you know,|sd
at midnight, tonight we all switch over or anything.|^q
Did they switch?|qy
Uh, I believe so,|^h
yeah,|ny
and I think they did it overnight|sd
cause you know, you can't do it gradually.|sd
That's an example of something you can't do gradually.|sd
Well that's true.|aa
It, it has to be kind of a discreet transaction|bf
Yes,|aa
it does|aa
A quantum leap from left to right hand drive|sd
Interesting.|ba
And they, -|%
but, you know, that must have taken, uh, -|%
that was something that had to be done quickly,|sd
Oh, yes.|aa
but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
I'm sure.|ba
Um, so I, I, I, I, I think it's essential that it's done|sv
and I think the real trick is to avoid the you know, -|sv
a little more attention to human psychology|sv
and, whereas, people want round numbers -|sv
and after all, the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers,|sd
Exactly,|aa
exactly.|aa
and so what the exact, -|%
the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented.|sv
Really, I think.|sv
Well, we do have the two liter soda pop bottles.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
I saw that,|sd
I saw that the other day.|sd
I don-, don't drink soda pop,|sd
Yeah.|b
but I saw a two liter soda pop bottle|sd
so, yeah,|%
things like that are a good start|sv
and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the, the, you know, the odd numbers,|sd
Right.|aa
Yes.|aa
That's true.|ba
Well, sure have enjoyed our talk.|fc
Yes,|fc
well get back to what you're doing|fc
and I'll do the same.|fc
I enjoyed talking with you too.|fc
Okay,|fc
God bless y-, -|fc
Bye-bye.|fc

There you go.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
First question,|sd
do you own your house?|qy
Uh, right,|na
well, we try.|sd
I mean it's a big mortgage in the sky|sd
and someday, maybe, we might even own it,|sd
but, um, for all practical purposes, I guess we hold the mortgage|sd
Our name is on the till,|sd
Yeah,|b
right.|b
so that implies ownership.|sd
No one else has offered to pay for it.|sd
That's right.|aa
I would not object if anybody did.|sd
Yeah,|b
really they could move right into the spare room|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, we have, we have had this one for five years now.|sd
Before that we lived in Garland, uh, probably about, you know, four blocks away.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Liked the area, chose to stay inside of Spring Park.|sd
It's a, uh, -|%
I don't know if you have been up here,|qy^d
but it is a residential homeowners,|sd
Right,|b
yeah,|b
So, there's a lot of, you know, activities, a lot of pluses and common land.|sd
But, uh, we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market, you know,|sd
it could not possibly have gone any lower|sd
and so we were wrong|sd
Oh, five years ago.|bf
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|b
I think, -|%
what, -|%
it bottom out about a ye-, year later.|sd
Yeah,|b
it, well, -|%
I mean just recently, I would say, I would give it two years back, when it was, I think, bottomed out.|sv
Oddly enough, two years, you know,|aa
I, uh, I think that, -|%
But, maybe not in your area,|sv
see, it was just different areas,|sd
not in, in, uh, this area.|sd
Cause this is about like the, -|%
That's a really nice area.|sv
Yeah.|b
Besides, it's, you know, it's not, it's not Richardson. Is it?|qy
It's still considered Garland.|qy^d
No,|nn
it's, it's Richardson.|sd
Oh, ok,|bk
yeah.|b
It's, Richardson|sd
and, hold on a second.|ad
to someone in Paul, I can hear you perfectly, perfectly well,|t3
I don't want to hear you.|t3
You are being rude.|t3
Whatever you ask or scream when I'm on the phone, the answer is no.|t3
Do you understand?|t3
to talking on How does that sound?|qw
There you go.|ba
Write that one down.|ad
Yeah,|b
there I go.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
It sounded good to me|sd
Yeah,|b
well, I hate to say how long that will last too.|sd
No,|^h
this area up here is, uh, all custom homes,|sd
and,|%
Right.|b
I don't think that many by the builder that built this house.|sd
And, we were not the first people, the first owners,|sd
I think we are the third owners.|sd
Uh, okay.|b
It was built by the architect for himself, who never moved into it. Who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep.|sd
Oh, no.|ba
Oh, yeah,|ba
caulking windows was a great mystery to them.|sd
Oh, gee.|ba
So, they just watched the water pour in on the carpet.|sd
But, it's a Sharif Myneer Homes, if that means anything,|sd
it did not really mean anything to me except,|sd
I, I,|sd
so, -|%
He builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now.|sd
I think he got out of the lower end market.|sd
Uh.|b
but, the houses here in, in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
Yeah,|b
well but, still I know that this one was built for two ninety nine, which is nowhere near what we paid for it.|sd
Right.|b
And I think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot, heavily wooded off the golf course.|sd
Oh, great.|ba
Yeah,|b
and the guy around the corner is being transferred|sd
so he said, uh, well, he did comparables that it's about eighty dollars,|sd
let's see what,|^h
I don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot|sd
Well|b
Probably eighty.|sv
I think it was sixty, eighty.|ar
Sixty, eighty.|b^m
I think.|h
Well because, I know our, our little house over here stuck in the middle of, you know, the subdivision is, I think fifty five,|sd
so, I think the high end is definitely, you know somewhere there|sv
Well, try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot|ad
No,|ar
it could not be,|sv
because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet,|sd
and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars.|sv
Yeah.|b
Just never.|sv
Well|%
Now, maybe, you know, that's pretty close to what it would have sold for, uh, brand new,|sv
or that's pretty much what it was built for.|sv
It's got an awful lot of nice things in it|sd
but, you know, I don't think, I think it's going to be a long time, if ever, when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really, uh, desirable.|sv
It's seems like people go for square footage only now --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- and, uh, cause. Have you been back to the Perry Homes, back here?|qy
Um, the ones that look like brick houses|br
The one that looks like Monopoly apartments.|sd
Right.|b
Yeah,|ny
I think those are awful.|sv
I'm sorry,|fa
I just don't see the designer's, -|sd
I just see him as trying to squish as much space, you know, as much house into the space as possible.|sd
They are huge when you are inside them.|sd
Yeah.|b
They are very spacious.|sd
They are, you know,|%
I was, I was in one today.|sd
It was forty two hundred square feet.|sd
Uh.|b
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well see that's, -|%
the house that we got is small enough so my husband and I, -|sd
because there's just the two of us|sd
and the two cats, um, can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard.|sd
And we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know. -|sd
See, when you have kids, you like to be able to,|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
But, I have been watching these houses go up|sd
and I, I don't, well, -|%
somebody was telling me, -|sd
I know somebody who lives back there,|sd
I have always questioned the quality of construction|sd
and I, I don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house.|sv
Oh.|b
When you watch them go up, you are just amazed that they do not fall over.|sv
Yeah.|b
And it takes them something like, thirty days to complete a house.|sd
Oh, that's amazing.|ba
Right now, in fact, even as we speak, we are having a deck put on in back,|sd
and these guys are phenomenal.|sd
They just, they, they are doing such a terrific job back there,|sd
I mean, you know, you pay for it too,|sd
but it's, it's like, really worth it.|sd
They are putting in a deck,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it's just, they are doing such a fine, fine job.|sd
We have got --|sd
I'm really excited about it,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, the house is built around the trees.|sd
Great.|ba
And with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up -|sd
so, it's real, real shady.|sd
But, that's one of the few things that really, uh, immediately pays back on return.|sd
But, what I was going to tell you, these Perry Homes back there, -|sd
Yeah.|b
when the people from M C I come down -|sd
and they are, you know, they are used to the Virginia area, metropolitan D C.|sd
Uh.|b
My God, they come down here and those houses, that, that look the colonial look what the, -|sd
Looks like the George Town brownstone|bf
Right,|aa
Yeah.|b
And, uh, the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it, for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars,|sv
Must be a dream.|^2
Yeah.|b
Because those things are selling like hot cakes.|sd
But, one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill, per month, last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars --|sd
Oh.|b
And I thought, -|%
I can't , -|ba
and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here.|sd
And I was thinking, well, you know, I know why your God damn bill is so high,|sd
He has no insulation, probably.|sv
it's because there's not a there's no insulation, insulation in those things.|sd
Oh, my.|ba
Yeah.|b
Gosh.|ba
What a trap. Huh.|bh
Any yet, you know, -|%
they, they show very well un-, they show very well unless you have, you know, lived in a lot of houses around the area,|sd
And you ask the right questions and can research,|sd
yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
And I think that makes a big difference.|sv
But, I like, I like this area|sd
and everything that I have been saying,|sd
Oh, I do too.|sd
I think if we had to sell now, we could come close to breaking even|sv
But, still, um, it's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that|sv
You're in, you're in the, -|%
Yes, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I, I think that Plano has really done a fantastic job.|sv
I mean, at least their plans have, are good.|sv
Um, how-, however, I was, -|%
maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, um, they've had some problems with,|sd
With the plastic.|^2
uh-huh.|aa
I thought that was most interesting.|sv
Well, I just, I thought it was sad that they, it started out as a good program. *two utts?|sv

a really good effort,|bf
that's right,|aa

Well, I was thinking about the other day, um, when I, when Dick and I were, oh, many, many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in Missouri, um, I went, oh, -|sd
I was probably, this was probably, -|%
see, it have been like nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight, um,|sd
we, I went to a meeting,|sd
and, uh, one of the, the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling|sd
and, um,|sd
Um.|b
and she had this fantastic, um, family effort in, in recycling,|sd
and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics,|sd
Oh.|b
and I thought wow, I mean, how, one person is doing that, you know,|sd
but my, my thought was it's a shame,|sd
I mean, it's wonderful that she's doing it and it,|sv
but wouldn't it be mu-, much nicer if we all did it,|sv
because her effort would have really, um, really, uh, been a good example for all of us.|sd
And yet, you know, and we were just sort of talking about it at the time.|sd
And here we are, you know,|sd
now we're doing it on a,|sd
Doing it -|ba
So it's wonderful that we've come that far, I think|sv
but, *slash error|%
What did she do with, -|%
if, if she, -|%
was she like a group that was doing it,|qy
or was she doing it on her own,|qrr
and,|qw
I think she was,|sd
I was trying to remember,|sd
it seems to me that she was doing it on her own, and living in Saint Louis,|sd
there were places where she could actually take her,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and so it wasn't, you know, something that was being picked up|sd
or, um, and I think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would.|sd
But I remember her saying yes, I have a trash can for this and a trash can for that, and a trash can for the other thing,|sd
and I thought wow, that's, that is wonderful, that somebody does that.|sd
You, you have to really want to do it, though.|sv
Yeah.|b
This is, -|%
even, even what you recycle, -|sv
because we, we do the, the, plastics and the,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Yes.|b
And, um, and, of course, then, you know, you try to buy right too,|sv
Sure you do,|ba
uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
it's, uh, we, we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Isn't that amazing?|bh
And I thought what are you complaining about,|sd
Well, you know,|%
Yes.|b
and, -|%

they just used things,|sd
they didn't,|sd
Yeah.|b
Right.|b
and, -|%
Yeah.|b
Well, I know, um,|h
I guess I got a good example from my mother,|sd
because she was always very, very conscientious about recycling things,|sd
and she is to this day,|sd
and, you know, I mean, she'll even, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
um, if she, -|%
for instance, she, she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for, you know, when she made cookies,|sd
it would go on that|sd
or,|sd
Yeah.|b
Right.|b
She just, she recycles everything.|sd
And I have done the same thing.|sd
I recycle like zip lock bags and,|sd
Right.|b
My kids get the biggest kick out of that.|sd
Although, they do the same thing|sd
I mean, they --|sd
Right.|b
but I think they know that that's,|sd
They've picked up the hab-, -|bf
Well, they do,|sv
and when they actually get out away from the home,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yes,|aa
and they appreciate how much it costs to do that.|sv
Yeah.|b
That's right.|aa
Well, I don't know, you know.|h
I, I wonder how, how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to, to make this whole thing work. I mean, the extra like washing out bottles and jars, or the extra of actually, uh, making sure that, uh, you take stuff over to, you know, -|sd
some people are compl-, now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside, you know,|sd
and I think golly Moses, you just do your part.|sd
You know, people are not, -|%
you, you, you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always ha-, work ou-, out.|sv
Right.|b
Well, see, this, this is what concerns me.|sd
You, -|%
over in Europe they don't have the kind of waste we do here.|sv
No,|aa
that's right.|aa
You, you've got to be in a country,|%
even in, in Mexico,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
I mean, what we throw away is, is a ransom, a king's,|sv
Yes.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and I, -|%
and even to people in our country,|sv
Yeah.|b
and,|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
you can't tell a person that lives in a hundred, two hundred, three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
No.|aa
This is, uh, I, this is why I thought Jimmy Carter was never very po-, very pos-, -|sd
you know, people didn't like him.|sv
Because he tried to say,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
right,|aa
do those little things,|bf
yeah,|aa
And, and, uh,|sv
that make a lot of difference,|bf
uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
it's, I, you know, -|%
and,|aa
It's, -|%
I think that it has to really hit home before,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Or you have to grow up with it being im-, important in your life,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, um, I don't know,|h
it's, uh it's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things I am than I, even myself, than I used to be,|sd
Right.|b
I mean, like I, I'd go to the, um, to the U T D, um, cafeteria for lunch sometimes --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they use styrofoam plates, when they wouldn't,|sd
Um.|b
Right.|b
You know, and I think to myself that's, that's crazy.|sd
I wonder if, you know, maybe I need to bring that to someone's attention, you know,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
and, and, uh, I'm seeing more and more of that,|sd
and, and I think it's, uh, just McDonald's effort to reduce the number of, of styrofoam, uh, boxes that they use,|sd
Right.|sd
I think is a good, good example, you know, that even,|sd
Huh.|b
I, I think the big question too we're looking at is, would you be willing to pay more for a product,|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, I think that may, that's kind of what it's coming to, I'm sure.|sv
That's, that's right|aa
and,|qh
Yeah.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
That's right,|aa
yeah.|aa
Or, and I don't, -|%
with the mind set of the American public, I think what they will do is start paying Mexico --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Wow.|ba
That doesn't ,|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
That's the way we solve problems.|sv
and unfortunately. -|%
And it's sad.|sv
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
what kind of house do you live in?|qw
Well, uh, we live in a, a brick home in far north Dallas|sd
and it's, uh, four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, it sounds like ours are pretty similar.|sv
I live in one,|sd
I don't have a swimming pool.|sd
And mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot.|sd
Yeah.|b
But the four bedrooms|sd
and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike.|sd
I think it's pretty much typical for this area.|sv
It is.|aa
Have you been living there very long?|qy
I've been in the house|no
I'm in here right now about twelve and a half years.|sd
So you've been there longer.|sd
We built this one about, uh, -|sd
it's been let's see it's been six years --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we subcontracted it out ourselves.|sd
We bought --|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then we subbed it out,|sd
so, we've been here a little over six years now. And --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I bet you, -|ba
Uh-huh.|b
My husband got his big garage.|sd
He ha-, we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines|sd
and, so he has all the work space he needs.|sd
Well, that sounds interesting.|ba
I bet he's enjoyed having it that way --|ba
He, -|%
-- because some-, -|%
kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications.|sv
It is,|aa
and that's why we decided to build.|sd
We looked --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and the garages were always, if the house w-, was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is --|sd
Well, then, most --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They're kind of rare.|sd
So we put a three car garage in.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space.|sd
All of it was taken up with just car space.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well that, -|%
my, we've just got a two car garage,|sd
but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything.|sd
Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.|sv
Now, mine does not work on cars,|ar
he just piddles on this and that.|sd
Oh, I see.|ba
But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling things.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, that's nice that it's not in your house.|ba
It really is.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own,|sv
and I, you know, I wouldn't mind having, -|%
and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but I, someone, -|%
I don't know,|h
it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something.|sd
Right.|b
So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would.|sd
Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come.|sd
His parents come|sd
and also the kids have friends who come --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and so --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I still, -|%
all three of my daughters are married,|sd
but, I don't know,|h
I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time.|sd
Right.|aa
Oh, I understand|aa
And we've got grandchildren now,|sd
so --|sd
Well, we, -|%
That's true|aa
and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room.|sv
That's right,|aa
you sure don't.|aa
At times I keep thinking, though, that might be kind of nice.|sd
Well,|sd
I've heard people say that.|sd
But, uh, my middle son is engaged,|sd
my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
He's out of college --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so he could afford to get married --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while,|sd
but she's still in college|sd
and we're just as happy for her to finish --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's --|sd
Well, I don't blame you for that.|ba
So, I hope so.|sd
Well, I have the three girls|sd
and then we ended up with four grandsons.|sd
Oh, ho-ho.|ba
And little boys are around the house --|sd
A whole new world.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I enjoy them coming, but for short doses|sd
I can understand.|aa
It feels, -|%
after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house,|sd
they know everything.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, they're fun.|sd
So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.|bf
Well, I just watch them.|sd
Yeah.|b
I d-, I never did put things up when my kids were little|sd
and I haven't with them.|sd
I try to teach them not to get into things.|sd
Well, that's the same thing that I did.|sd
I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren.|sd
I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes.|sv
At least my daughters have.|sd
They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up.|sd
So it's worked pretty well.|sd
There's, -|%
I don't really think anything's been broken.|sd
Every now and then we have to kind of go and say, now don't bother this you know.|sd
Um, uh-huh|b
But, all in all, they mind pretty well.|sd
But, I guess most of the hou-, -|%
d-, -|%
what kind of roof does your house have?|qw
Here I'm getting off the subject.|sd
Well, we have, -|%
All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I've never done it before,|sd
so I guess that's all I have to do, right|qy
I guess so.|no
I've been called several times,|sd
and I push in, pushed in my number,|sd
they kept saying you have the invalid code --|sd
Oh, really.|b
-- and then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right.|sd
Oh|b
Oh, so this is the first time I've even done it.|sd
Yeah.|b
I wonder how long it's going to be on for.|qw
I think five minutes is the max.|sd
Oh, no,|ba
I mean, this whole thing, like for two months or something,|sd
do you know?|qy
Oh, I don't know.|no
Yeah,|b
okay,|%
well back to crime,|sd
I guess we're supposed to talk about that.|sv
They say what aspect are you worried about,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
well, I think at this point, I for one am worried about every aspect|sd
Right,|aa
especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex,|sd
you know, there's so much going on here.|sv
I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from.|sd
Well, that, and in the schools, too --|sv
Uh-huh,|b
golly|ba
I know.|aa
and, -|%
Have they done that in Garland?|qy
No,|nn
I, -|%
not that I'm aware of.|sd
Now, um, -|%
I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting --|sd
Right.|b
-- so, um, -|%
Well, we had a vice principal shot at here --|sd
Is that right?|bh
And the one boy killed himself a few years ago, in the, in a grade school,|sd
so --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
yeah.|b
So. Yeah,|b
it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school|sd
and you wonder if he's going to get shot.|sd
I mean, we didn't have to worry about that before.|sd
I know|aa
What next?|qh
I know,|aa
it's, it's, it's getting, -|sv
it's been out of hand, I think, for a while,|sv
and it just continues to get worse.|sv
Right,|aa
and, you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this,|sv
they just can't do it.|sv
Yeah.|b
I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family --|sv
Right.|b
and, uh, and how we going to bring that back together.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's, -|%
I thi-, -|%
I agree,|aa
I think that's where it stems from, is that and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that are working nowadays --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right|b
and, -|%
-- and that may impact it as well.|sv
I think so,|aa
and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
These, some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all --|sv
Yeah --|aa
-- I think --|sv
-- they don't think twice about it.|sv
Yeah.|b
Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the, -|h
I think it was just rare,|sv
I really do.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
My mother, well, she's like seventy-four now.|sd
She, when she was a young girl, she had a beautiful, beautiful cousin that lived in California,|sd
and she was dating this millionaire's son|sd
and he wanted to marry her,|sd
and she wouldn't marry him|sd
and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both,|sd
and, uh, -|%
You're kidding.|ba
No,|aa
I'm the one, -|%
Himself and her?|qy
Yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
that must have been at least fifty years ago or more,|sd
but --|sd
Oh, wow,|ba
I bet.|ba
-- but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas --|sv
Oh, I know,|aa
-- it's just, you know, another killing.|sv
Well, they were, -|%
I was watching some show the other day,|sd
and they were talking about, uh, mass murderers --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently,|sd
and --|sd
Um.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Right,|aa
lots of their picture and life story and everything.|sd
Right,|aa
and then you get to their life story,|sd
Oh, they came from a broken family --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- oh this person had mental problems --|sd
Right.|b
-- oh duh, duh, duh --|^q
Right.|b
I know, how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible,|qh
Yeah.|b
So, uh, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was, oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.|sd
Is that right?|bh
Yeah,|ny
I think it was on a Hard Copy,|sd
she was a real attractive blond girl, in, in her freshman year of college --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and some boy she tried to get rid of, he was like in his twenties, -|sd
Uh, I remember seeing that,|sd
Remember that?|qy
I saw that on Hard Copy|na
Right,|aa
right,|aa
that's, uh, -|%
Yes.|aa
My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School.|sd
Is that right?|bh
Yeah,|ny
can you believe it,|qh
that's just, uh, -|%
I'm trying to remember,|^h
he, um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something --|sd
Taco Bueno,|sd
right,|aa
uh-huh.|b
-- and he just shot them --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|aa
I remember seeing that.|sd
Yeah, uh, uh,|b
isn't that weird?|qy
Yeah,|ny
there's just too many crazy people out there these days.|sv
I know,|aa
and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime.|sv
You know, he was just begging her on the phone,|sv
that's not doing anything.|sv
Yeah.|b
And there are times I think, gee, I should give my kids gu-, -|sd
not be a very good conversationalist on fishing. -|sd
I don't do a lot of it.|sd
Well, I do love to fish.|sd
Well good,|ba
maybe I can learn something.|sv
Well, I don't know how much you can learn.|arp_nd
I'm not so sure I'm good at it,|sd
but I do enjoy doing it.|sd
Do you?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Well, it is fun, what little I do.|sd
Of course, I don't, you know, -|h
I think when they refer to different kinds of fishing -|sd
I told my husband last night when I had called and they had, told me that this was a topic, I said, well, I can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm|sd
He said, I don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about|sd
Well, I hope it is,|sd
there's not a whole lot of different kinds.|sd
That's about the only kind I know how to do.|sd
I don't do a lot of deep sea fishing,|sd
I, because I get seasick,|sd
but --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I do a lot of fishing for, uh, bass.|sd
We have a lot of, uh, uh, couple of lakes in our area that are fil-, just filled with good sized bass.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then when I get tired of them outwitting me, I fish for catfish --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we use worms and shiners, which is pretty much like minnows --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then I also use spinner baits and plastic worms.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It all depends on what I'm fishing for, and the time of day.|sd
Well, it sounds like you do quite a bit of it.|bf
I do.|aa
Uh, there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here,|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Fishing's a good way to do that,|sd
and I have a lot of friends who like to go fishing.|sd
Do you have a boat?|qy
No,|nn
I don't.|sd
I have a friend who has a little infla-, inflatable raft,|sd
and we --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I wish I had a boat,|sd
but I don't.|sd
I think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas.|sd
The ones around here are so big, that you can fish off the dock --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but unless you have a boat you can't really get into the, where they call the good fishing holes, you know.|sd
Right.|b
That's the same way here, isn't it?|qy
Is it?|qy
You have to get back in the sticks in the, -|na
Uh-huh.|b
My in-laws live on a lake, uh, a little bit east of Dallas, kind of in the Piney Woods,|sd
and the lake is beautiful,|sd
and I like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish,|sd
but actually catching fish to eat per se, you don't really do much of that right there.|sd
I catch a lot of little old, uh, I think they call them perch --|sd
Right.|aa
-- and then the, the, uh, turtles try to eat up all my bait|sd
Oh.|b
So it's, it's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit --|sd
We don't have,|sd
-- but it's kind of fun.|sd
but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes.|sd
Um --|sd
And I,|sd
Do they ever get on your hook?|qy
No,|nn
we, uh, -|%
occasionally I'll catch an eel --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They just kind of, -|%
Are they poisonous snakes?|qy
Uh, we have a lot of cotton mouth,|sd
so yes|ny
they are, definitely --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they live in little shallow, little coves that I like to fish in,|sd
so I seem them swimming by every once in a while.|sd
Yeah,|b
I think I'd be a little bit afraid of those.|sd
Yeah,|b
they can, they're, they're certainly ugly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We, uh, saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws' place last year.|sd
It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know.|sd
Great big snake,|sd
and it, of course, it scared the women to death, you know,|sd
but the men come out and said oh, well, that's only a, a king snake, it won't really hurt you, you know.|sd
But it looked so bad --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us,|sd
but we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there, you know|sd
Definitely.|aa
But they're scary looking.|sv
Do you have bass?|qy
Yes, uh,|ny
I think that, uh, probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else.|sd
Right.|b
Well, that's pretty much the same way here.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, -|%
Now, they have a lot of bass tournaments.|sd
Well, we have those.|sd
I don't -- -|%
Uh-huh.|b
-- I inevitably, if I enter one of those, I never catch a thing.|sd
Oh, no.|ba
I just go out there and sit and watch other people do it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well that's kind of, -|%
we've never entered a tournament or anything.|sd
We're not that big into fishing,|sd
but I see a lot of people,|sd
you know, early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out,|sd
and they'll say, Well, there's a big bass tournament this weekend,|sd
and all those people are here for the tournament, you know.|sd
Oh, yes.|ba
So I think there's a lot of people that have, you know, really, I guess that you'd call it really sport fishing,|sv
they're really into it to try to win.|sv
Yeah,|aa
oh, definitely.|aa
My.|%
Certainly here they are.|sd
But it is, it's very, a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around.|sv
The peace and calmness is really relaxing.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That's what I do a lot.|sd
I've never tried taking a book with me.|sd
I'll have to try that one of these days.|sd
Hi,|fp
this is Donna Donahue.|fp
Hi, Donna.|fp
Hi.|fp
Ready to get started?|qy
Uh, yeah,|ny
I think so.|sd
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Sort of an interesting topic since I just got back from lunch here|sd
Okay.|b
Well, what did you have for lunch?|qw
Oh, it was, uh, it was, -|%
I'm an officer in the Air Force,|sd
Oh.|b
Oh.|b
Well, that's interesting.|ba
Okay.|b
So our topic is, is food today,|sd
is that, -|%
Yeah.|b
Okay.|b
If you're having a dinner party, what, what would you serve?|qw
Okay, uh,|^h
do you want me to go first?|qy
Sure.|na
Okay.|^h
If I was having a dinner party I would probably, um, have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips around and peanuts.|sd
And then I would have, um, let's see. I usually have like a little theme when I have a dinner party|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and then we'd have, um, like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar salad.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, um, let's see what else.|t1
Um, maybe some rolls and, um, I guess some, uh, some rice or something like that.|sd
How does that sound?|qw
Jeez,|ba
well, well, when is the party here?|qh
Yeah.|b
Um, yeah,|%
that would take some planning|sd
but, -|%
I don't know|h
being a, being the bachelor here that I am, I, I don't think I'd, I'd be a-, b-, -|sd
I mean it, it's not a question of capability here to do something like that.|sd
It's just there's, there's no motivation.|sd
That's right.|aa
You know, I want to, I want to throw some charcoal on the grill and, and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that|sd
but, um, -|%
Well, that sounds good too.|ba
I have, um, I have three kids --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so, um, when we have friends over I have my oldest kind of baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs|sd
and, um, usually we just have very plain kind of, you know, interesting, not very interesting meals.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun,|sd
but it's not a,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
it?|qy
Yeah,|ny
that's what they,|sd
Okay.|bk
Um, let's see now|^h
wh-, -|%
okay,|%
so you would have a barbecue wouldn-, -|qy
Well, I live on a, I live on a lake here,|no
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, so it, -|%
and then during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors,|sd
Oh, sure.|ba
like that's a little more a casual thing.|sd
But in mine the wintertime it's not bad too because then I've got a, a fireplace and a nice, nice house and all that|sd
so we,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, that sounds wonderful.|ba
I just haven't, uh, really tried a whole lot|sd
but, uh --|h
Uh-huh.|b
let's see.|^h
I have had, well, one time I did have a dinner party.|sd
I served a, uh, uh, -|%
I had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so -|%
Oh, you are in New York right now?|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
Oh.|b
I'm, I'm in Texas.|sd
I didn't know this was all, from all over the whole country.|sd
Oh, yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
Oh, I see.|bk
it is.|sd
It's, -|%
And I'm fr-, originally from Long Island.|sd
Oh, no kidding?|qy
Yes,|ny
and now where are you in New York?|qw
Upstate.|sd
Oh, upstate.|b^m
Rome.|sd
In, uh,|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
Oh, okay.|bk
Is that where you, you are originally from around there?|qy
Oh, okay.|bk
and, uh, been all over the place.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
That's interesting.|ba
Okay,|^h
let's see.|^h
Um, well, I like to have, um, sometimes when I have a dinner party I'll have, um, everybody bring something,|sd
Yeah.|b
and that's real interesting because then you get different, um, different kinds of foods and new recipes|sd
and, um, uh, sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like,|sd
Right.|b
and get the recipe from them or whatever.|sd
And we are just getting interested in, in Mexican food|sd
because here in Texas they have lots of,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and,|sd
Sure.|ba
do you know what a fajita is?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Yeah,|ny
Yeah.|b
I've been down to Texas a few times,|sd
Okay.|bk
Yes.|b
They have some delicious, delicious things,|sv
and I, um, -|%
since I always make chicken burritos and just --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and you boil them, maybe like four chicken breasts,|sd
and you boil them until they are cooked.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then you debone them and, and kind of shred them up into the meat that has gotten cooled|sd
and you take, um, s-, little bit, maybe two tablespoons of butter and a fr-, in a big frying pan. And chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt,|sd
Uh, I guess I've always kind of liked golf.|sd
I, I worked on a golf course at, at one time|sd
and that's how I picked up golf.|sd
And, uh, I don't know|h
it's just a, kind of a challenging game.|sv
It sure is.|aa
I play at least three times a week.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I'm on it,|sd
I haven't gotten the chance lately though to play.|sd
I'm trying to get back into it.|sd
Uh, so, uh, I got to start all over again.|sd
It's not like riding a bicycle.|sv
You do tend to,|sv
No.|aa
Well, I'm one of those rare left-handed golfers.|sd
Oh.|b
Yeah.|b
And I do enjoy playing.|sd
What is your handicap?|qw
Right now it's three.|sd
Okay.|bk
Uh, I was down at about four or five quite awhile ago.|sd
It's probably up there to twenty now if I to start again.|sd
Well, if you play with some consistency though, you can get it right back down.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
I have got to try and get out there.|sd
I, I know with our, our long winters I, I enjoy watching it.|sd
I don't know if it's just because I like the game or I just like to, to see the warm weather.|sd
Uh, well, we can usually play here year around.|sd
Sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play,|sv
and I'm pretty much addicted to golf,|sd
so. I get out there one way or the other.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter|sd
you almost have to relearn every spring to, to get back out.|sd
It's a good game though.|sv
It's very challenging|sv
and the reason I like it so much is because I'm essentially playing against myself.|sd
Yeah.|b
That's the way I look at it.|sd
I, I play in, in lo-, a lot of groups|sd
and but I, they keep score and, between themselves|sd
but I really don't care.|sd
Um, I go out|sd
and each shot I say, well, this is what I'm going to try to do --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then I see how close I can come to that.|sd
Right.|aa
Yeah,|aa
you always work on trying to improve each day|bf
and, -|%
Yeah,|b
and i-, inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another.|sd
Either I'm not driving very well|sd
or I'm not hitting long irons very well|sd
or I'm not putting well|sd
or, but sometimes it all comes together.|sd
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
I know what you mean.|aa
I, when I used to golf out there I'd putt well but I, I wouldn't, uh, chip well.|sd
One of the two, uh,|sd
or something would go wrong|sd
but I always managed to, to get near par anyway.|sd
Well, we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst.|sd
Oh.|b
And I went to that.|sd
Craig Statler won in a playoff.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But we, uh, -|%
this is a big golf area.|sd
Yeah.|b
We have a lot of, uh, -|%
I'd say we probably have within fifteen miles, twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course, Pine Hurst|sd
and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Do you have, uh, long waits, uh, to get on the course?|qy
Yes,|ny
we do as a matter of fact.|sd
It, it, uh, it's only been that way in the last five years.|sd
Yeah.|b
But now you, uh, -|%
most of the courses have a, uh, two day advance tee time you have to call,|sd
Yeah.|b
Okay.|b
I just moved into this small community|sd
so I'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here.|sd
I'm hoping that won't be,|%
I,|sd
That's some cold golf too, isn't it?|qy
Yeah|ny
Are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather?|qy
We have cold.|no
Yeah.|b
Usually January and the first two weeks of February.|sd
Well, I wish that's all we had.|ba
But, uh, last week we were in the seventies.|sd
Something is coming through now|sd
so it's like in the low forties right now.|sd
Oh.|b
But, uh, it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties.|sd
We have very windy winters --|sd
Yeah|b
But we don't get any snow anymore.|sd
I don't, I don't know what changed that pattern.|sd
We used to get four or five inches a year.|sd
Now we get nothing.|sd
It's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall.|sd
I see.|b
Well, at least it, that doesn't, uh, get in the way of golfing|sv
so that -|%
No,|aa
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
that's what they do here sometimes.|sd
You hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there|sd
but, if you got, -|%
So, how is the weather out there?|qw
Uh, it's really cold|sd
and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold|sd
and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
You have, breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff.|sd
How about you guys?|qw
Um. Uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same.|sd
The usual, I think.|sd
Oh.|b
So, nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff|sd
It's good.|sd
Yeah,|b
well the weather, let's see, well, the snow here is different from Utah's,|sd
because I have lived in Utah for like ten years.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
What part?|qw
And, uh, -|%
Provo.|sd
I was going to B Y U.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Okay.|bk
Yeah.|aa
And, uh, the snow is like, really cold.|sd
I mean, it's, like, really humid|sd
so it seems wetter or something like that.|sd
It's, -|%
It's more humid in Utah than there?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Or there?|qrr
It's more humid in Iowa --|sd
Okay.|bk
Right.|aa
Yeah.|b
Okay.|bk
And it seems like when the winds blow, it's really, it goes right through you.|sd
It's really different from Utah's weather.|sd
I thought Utah was cold,|sd
but I think Iowa is a lot colder|sd
Yeah,|aa
see, that's how it is in Texas, too|sd
because when it's cold, it's really cold.|sd
So, -|%
Yeah,|b
I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind|sv
What's that?|br
I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind.|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
So the humidity is I think what does it|sv
Yeah,|aa
I think that's true.|aa
Because I, I noticed when I got here, too,|%
because like I'd, -|%
when it would snow in Texas --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we'd have to get really warm,|sd
and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing|sd
and you don't --|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
It was weird.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, so how long ago did you graduate?|qw
Or did you,|qrr
or, -|%
Uh, I graduated in nineteen eighty-seven.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah,|ny
my husband got his doctorate at B Y U,|sd
so that's, -|%
and so he just graduated this past year.|sd
Oh.|b
So you just barely moved away?|qy
Uh-huh|ny
Yeah,|ny
Do you like it out there?|qy
We miss --|sd
You do?|qy
Yeah.|b
Because it's, like, really flat here|sd
Well, not flat, but hilly.|sd
But no big mountains or anything.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So you just moved away a year ago?|qy
Uh, in August.|na
Wow, really recent.|ba
Yeah.|aa
But, uh, see, see what else can I say about the weather.|t1
Uh, well, today was warmer|sd
It was like forty-five|sd
Oh, warm|ba
So, what's the temperature up today over there?|qw
Oh, man,|ba
it's got to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Maybe not that warm.|no
Probably about, uh, -|%
yeah.|%
It's not, it's not that cold, really.|sd
And whenever I remembered the weather reports in Utah, I never really remember them talking too much about wind chill.|sd
Yeah.|b
But they talk about wind chill here all the time.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's a big deal in Texas, too.|sd
They said it could be, like, six degrees out and, like, negative forty-one wind chill.|sd
Um.|b
So, that's what we're not used to|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
That makes a big difference. Huh.|sv
So, oh, I, -|%
So, did you used to ski when you were out here?|qy
What's that?|br
Did you used to ski when you were in Utah?|qy
Oh, I've only, I've only skied in Utah once.|no
Oh, really?|bh
I only skied once my whole life|sd
But, do you do a lot of skiing there?|qy
Uh, not tons,|ng
but I like to when I get a chance.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I've only been once so far, but had the opportunity a couple times since then.|sd
Just saving my money for Christmas things --|sd
Yeah.|b
So is this your first year in Utah?|qy
Uh, no,|nn
this is actually my third year.|sd
And you're going to school there?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Oh.|b
Yep.|ny
At U of U,|qy
or, -|%
No,|nn
at B Y U.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Oh.|b
So, but, I'll be here a long time at this rate.|sd
What's your major?|qw
Uh, it was nursing,|sd
but I'm in the process of changing it right now.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
oh.|b
Because it's really, really competitive at B Y U.|sd
Yeah.|b
You have to have like a three seven to get in|sd
so,|%
That's true.|aa
I'm going to look into some other fields.|sd
I'd like, -|%
all the science classes and that, I'm just not really enjoying too much|sd
so --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so, -|%
Yeah,|b
that's, that's a good idea.|ba
Did you graduate in a certain field|qy
or, -|qy
Uh, education.|sd
I got a double major.|sd

Uh, elementary and special ed.|sd
Really?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
That what my sister did.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah,|ny
you might know her.|sv
Here name is Lori, Bird.|sd
Maybe not|h
I think she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably,|sd
but, she got her doc-, -|%
Yeah,|b
well, I can't, -|arp_nd
there are so many girls in all my classes,|sd
I can't remember --|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Because they, since, uh, stopped that program. I mean, where you can --|sd
Oh, have they?|bh
Oh.|b
I mean, it's, it's really, -|sd
We're set.|sd
Okay.|bk
What changes do you feel have happened?|qw
Oh, I guess the first thing has been the, uh, for the right, for women to vote.|sv
I think that has been a major change and also the fact that, uh, there are so mu-, many more women in the work force nowadays than there were|sv
and that's probably going to increase.|sv
Right.|b
Increases each year, doesn't it?|qy
I'm sorry?|br
It increases each year I think.|sv
It sure does.|aa
Yeah,|aa
there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays.|sv
Well, and I think women have kind of had, uh, in the past the real subservient --|sv
Role?|^2
Right.|aa
And, uh, -|%
That's changing|sv
Well, we do to some degree --|sv
Right.|b
-- but, uh, uh, I think it's not as much as it was.|sv
Right,|aa
yeah,|aa
I, I agree.|aa
It definitely --|sv
I,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Because there is just, i-, impossible to keep up on everything else.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active role in taking care of the home.|sv
Well, you know, they've been talking about -|%
and I don't know, uh, what the status is on it,|h
but, you know, women get maternity leave and stuff like that|sd
and I know that they've, there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave --|sd
Right.|b
but you know, I haven't really heard much about that recently.|h
Well, you know, there is a lot of companies that won't give mat-, women maternity leave for that very reason.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, in fact, I know the school districts down here, you, they don't have maternity leave.|sd
Uh --|sd
Oh, is that right?|bh
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And I don't know, uh, if bigger company companies do,|h
but when I was employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either|sd
and that was the reason|sd
because they thought was showing prejisim to women and not to men|sd
but,|%
Huh, that's interesting.|ba
That's a bummer, though|sv
Yeah|aa
it is.|aa
I mean,|sd
You have to save all of your, uh, vacation time.|sd
You do.|aa
You have to save all your vacation time|sd
and --|sv
Yeah.|b
but, uh, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
What do you see, uh, changing in the future?|qw
I think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies, uh, run by females.|sv
Right,|aa
and, and --|%
And we'll prob-, -|%
I'm sorry?|br
Maybe top level.|sv
Right,|aa
right,|aa
upper management,|sv
more women in upper management|sv
and probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles.|sv
More governors and, I think, you know, roles like that.|sv
That would be kind of nice|ba
Well, we've got, in Texas, we have a female governor.|sd
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
And we had a female mayor here in Dallas,|sd
and she just, her term just ended|sd
and, uh, so I think we're probably going to see more of that --|sv
Yeah --|b
-- I think that's probably good.|sv
A little more integration.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners|sv
and, -|%
Right, you know,|b
I mean, and that's fine with me --|ba
I think, -|%
-- but sometimes, -|%
I mean I'm not a women's libber by any means,|sd
but --|%
Right.|b
there are issues that, you know, as far as, like, equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff, I totally am for.|sv
Right.|b
But, I don't get into the, uh, the real --|sd
No,|aa
I don't either.|aa
I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal|sv
Yeah.|b
We just function differently|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
And, uh, I'm not capable of lifting what, uh, a man can lift and --|sd
Yeah.|b
but, uh --|%
Right.|b
and they're probably, -|%
I'm sure, in Dallas since you're big places, a lot more women are, uh, working right out of their home with their P C's or with their lap computers or whatever.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I, I've heard of that.|aa
Uh, I haven't really talked to anybody that's, you know, too involved with that.|sd
But, I mean, I think that is a, -|%
I think that, -|%
Like the cottage industry.|sv
Is, is that what you're talking about, women working out of their homes?|qy
Right.|na
Yeah,|bk
uh, I think it's wonderful|sv
Right.|b
You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week|sd
and, -|%
Yeah.|b
Course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and --|sd
Oh, I kn-, -|%
By the phone and all that.|^2
so, uh, it would be kind of exciting in some ways to, to see a little bit more of that|sv
and some ways, it might be kind of scary.|sv
Right.|b
Think anybody could do it,|sv
but,|%
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and --|sv
Right.|b
Right,|b
but then you know, there is the process of selection.|sv
Would you have to give them --|qh
Right.|b
Right.|b
and, would be nice, though.|sv
How big is Provo?|qw
Um.|%
That a little town or, or a bigger city?|qy
Um, it's not one of the bigger ones. It's probably, um, I compare it to the size of Plano, maybe a little smaller.|sd
Plano, Texas.|sd
Oh.|b
I talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town, I think.|sd
Yeah,|ny
I forgot the name of the town.|sd
I thought maybe it was you|qy^d
Oh, well, anyway, we're supposed to talk about education.|sd
I certainly have some ideas since I'm studying it now in college.|sd
I'd say, first of all, they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading, writing, arithmetic --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to,|sv
and it shows up.|sv
That's one idea.|sd
Do you have any?|qy
Um, I don't know,|no
I'm pretty, I think I'm pretty satisfied with, um, -|sd
I gre-, I grew up in Plano --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, and my dad is actually on the school board there,|sd
so, I kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's -|%
Plano, uh, improved greatly in the last twenty, twenty-five years --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- that's for sure.|sv
It used to be the pits.|sd
And Arlington is excellent now,|sd
but I'm just speaking overall --|sd
Oh.|b
Yeah.|b
Something is definitely wrong.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, one thing, they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing,|sv
so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year|sv
and they truly can't read --|sv
Right.|b
-- so I don't know how they expect them to, uh, pass history when they can't read anything, you know, even read a word problem in math.|sd
So, um, that's definitely a problem.|sv
Another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do.|sv
Right.|b
But, um, -|%
So do you, what do you think is good about the schools?|qw
That is good about, -|%
well, it depends on where you are.|sv
They're all so different.|sv
That's another thing --|sd
Yeah.|b
There's no national curriculum, you know,|sd
I mean, what they'd be teaching in an Arlington school they may not be teaching in a Plano school --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and in the same school district, you may, even in an Arlington seventh grade for instance, you may have an English class|sd
you may have half literature for the whole year,|sd
whereas in another one they're going to concentrate on grammar --|sd
Grammar.|b^m
it's up to the teacher, in other words.|sv
So that's kind of o-, you know, that's kind of odd to me.|sv
Yeah.|b
It depends on, uh, what school you're in and who your teacher is, actually --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- or is how you end up -|sv
Overall, Arlington is good, one of the better ones in the state,|sd
so I guess we lucked out when we moved here.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, yeah,|b
that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. -|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point,|sd
and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So. -|%
But do you think that there should be, um, nationwide, um, curriculum?|qy
I don't know.|no
I just read about that the other day,|sd
and I had never even thought of it.|sd
Actually it makes sense to a certain extent,|sv
because sometimes, like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what, uh, -|sd
they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so I guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn.|sv
Right.|b
But, uh. We actually rank forty-ninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes, you know.|sd
Um.|b
That's, that's pretty low that there's --|sv
Yeah.|b
so, um, unless we want to keep paying, paying for these people that can't make it in society, we're going to have to do something.|sv
I don't know.|sd
Obviously nobody's smart enough to have figured it out yet,|sv
so I probably can't|sv
But I do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five, six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write --|sv
-- because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays --|sd
Right.|b
Uh, you can't, you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something you know, or fill out an application to work at McDonalds if you can't read.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, uh, I think that's, that's a start at least, going back to the basics in the early grades --|sv
-- and, um, they say that the average English student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago,|sd
and that's a big jump.|sv
I believe that|aa
Did you go to school in Plano?|qy
I did.|na
Through high school.|qy^d
Uh-huh,|ny
uh, kinder-, -|%
Up, up there, maybe, maybe you guys don't have as, uh, big a problem with air pollution as many, do you?|qy
We, we, we have a terrible air pollution problem.|sd
Do you really?|bh
Our summers are extremely, uh, hazardous --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and during, uh, certain wind directions because we get the, uh, Gary, Indiana --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze, uh --|sd
That's horrible.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
And they do post, uh, uh, warnings for people who have, uh, heart diseases or respiratory problems --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
In the winter it's not as severe.|sd
Right.|b
But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I don't think it's going to go very far,|sv
but it, it was, uh, a way of, uh, triggering, uh, awareness.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
So what's the conditions like in Dallas?|qw
Well, uh, in Dallas, I, I haven't seen air pollution quite on a, quite on a level that we had in Denver.|sd
I grew up in Denver,|sd
and, and I've lived there most of my life,|sd
and we used to have those, uh, you know, the posted warning days.|sd
Uh, however, in Colorado now, they have the emissions control law, which has really cut down, -|sd
probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to po-, post warnings now, you know, as far as health concerns.|sd
Um.|b
Uh, due to that emi-, the, the emissions, uh, uh, control on the vehicles, seems that all of our, all of our, uh, smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry.|sd
Wisconsin has a, a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it, it is drivable.|sd
Um.|b
So, they've, they've tried to do a lot of that --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I thi-, -|%
you know, there seem to be, at least in certain little pockets, -|sd
and we were talking earlier about Madison --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- Madison has one of the nicest, uh, bike, uh, road, uh, sharing programs of, of any city in Wisconsin --|sd
Oh, really.|b
-- and all Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of, uh, bike trails for recreational use --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And there is a, a real promotion of, of biking --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, um, there are still a lot of people who insist on, on driving their own automobiles --|sd
Right.|b
I find that a little irritating, because --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
it, it becomes, uh, -|%
maybe to you and I who have grown up in some in, uh, uh, some more beautiful parts of the country, uh, I think that, that, uh, we become a little more aware, uh, rather quickly of, of what's happening with air pollution and how, uh, how horrible it really is.|sv
Um, I, I notice people in, in Dallas seem to say, Well, sure, there's air pollution, but, you know, really, how bad is, how bad could this problem really be.|sd
Send, send them to Wisconsin,|ad
and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes --|oo_co_cc
Oh really|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and --|sv
Uh-huh.|%
how'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour --|qh
Right.|b
Right.|b
It's, uh, really a serious issue for those of us up in this, uh, sector up, up here.|sv
Do you find that, um, or, or do you hypothesize that, that most of the, uh, smog or, or air pollution comes from vehicles|qy
or does it come mostly from industry up there?|qy
I think it's mostly vehicles --|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- that causes the acid rain.|%
That I'm a little uncertain of,|sd
but --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I had talked with my parents.|sd
I, I grew up, uh, I was born in, uh, Muncie, Indiana, and, and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute,|sd
and I had asked them before, uh, -|sd
I went back to visit recently, about a year ago,|sd
and I asked them,|sd
I said, did you ever realize the air pollution that was, -|sd
I'm sorry, um --|fa
That's okay,|bd
I didn't hear.|sd
-- hobbies.|sd
Okay.|b
Let me see,|^h
I don't know if that took or not,|sd
I'll do it again.|oo_co_cc
Okay.|b
Okay.|%
What are your hobbies?|qw
I hear you have kids, right?|qy
You heard her in the background|sd
That's babies.|sd
That's your full time, uh, hobby, right?|qy
Takes a lot of time, huh.|na
I like, uh, most sports.|sd
I like to do that.|sd
I kind of like to do a little bit of sewing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, little bit of embroidery work, once in a while.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
What do you like to do?|qo
Um, I try to do some painting, although I'm not very good at it|sd
Well, I'm sure you probably are.|ba
Well, no,|bd
not really.|bd
You like it,|sv
that's the main . -|sv
Yeah,|aa
I, I have, you know, I inherited the genes that make me think I'm creative,|sd
That's right.|aa
So, I always try.|sd
I, I do some sewing, mostly out of necessity.|sd
Um, I'm making drapes for my house, just because I'm, -|sd
Oh, boy, that's hard sewing.|ba
Yeah,|aa
well, it isn't and it is.|aap_am
It is, you know, -|%
actually the sewing isn't the hard part,|sd
it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it --|sv
Measure it and get it to, -|bf
Well, if it, it depends on how elaborate you get it.|aap_am
If you get pleats and all kinds of, -|sv
Yeah,|aa
I've been doing that|sd
and,|%
That's a lot of work.|ba
yeah,|aa
that, -|%
but usually have to do the pleats by hand.|sd
So that, at least --|sd
Oh.|b
but, -|%
Right,|b
right.|b
Yeah,|b
and I've, I've gone and, you know, put the needle through my thumb a few times|sd
but, -|%
That feels really good.|ba
Yeah,|aa
so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything, but I, I need to do it.|sd
To do it,|aa
right.|aa
I have, let's see, I have a dog, and a lot of fish.|sd
Keeping fish, I guess --|sd
Keeping fish . -|b^m
Well, they're probably easier than keeping dogs, though, aren't they.|sv
Um, yes and no.|aap_am
It depends on how frequently they die, and --|sd
Oh, no.|ba
How much that bothers you,|b^m
and you probably have to clean out the tank too.|sv
That's, -|%
you don't have to do as much as, as I thought.|arp_nd
In fact, my problem, -|%
I had fish as a kid|sd
and they always died --|sd
Oh, no.|ba
and, what, I'm, what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean --|sv
Oh, you're kidding --|ba
-- because you have, -|%
-- because they need to have a little bit of the, -|bf
Right,|aa
you need to let the bacteria build up,|sv
and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance.|sv
I see.|b
And I would just take everything out and just like, you know, wash it with scalding hot water --|sd
Oh, no.|ba
-- and it would kill all the bacteria,|sd
and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again --|sd
And so you'd have to --|bf
-- so. -|%
Right.|aa
That's right.|aa
So now only, I only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing --|sd
Right,|aa
right.|aa
-- and I don't try and sterilize things|sd
Don't go through the whole nine yards|bf
and --|sv
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
So you've had fish for a long time.|bf
Well, I've had them, -|%
I guess it's been two years now I've had a, a tank here,|sd
and then back at home I used to have a small, you know, five gallon tank.|sd
But that never worked well.|sd
What size do you have now?|qw
Oh, that's a good size.|ba
It's a lot easier.|sd
Have you ever had it, uh, crack or break or leak.|qy
No|nn
No,|nn
not yet.|sd
Fifty-five gallons, you'd hope it would never do that.|sv
That's right,|aa
I really do.|sd
But, you know. -|%
Do you have all kinds of different fish|qy
or, -|%
Yeah,|ny
I just have, you know, what they call community fish --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't get into the -- -|sd
Real exotic. -|^2
-- right,|aa
right.|aa
The expensive ones.|sd
Well, they're probably hardy, harder to take care of|sv
and, -|%
They are.|aa
They're very expensive|sd
and, you know, when you die, it's like, when they die it's more like an investment.|sv
Yes,|b
I bet it is.|ba
You lost an investment|sv
so, -|%
Do you have problems with them, uh, the fish eating each other?|qy
No,|nn
not really.|sd
Only if there's baby fish.|sd
Right.|b
You always have to isolate those.|sd
Then you have to, -|%
how do you isolate them?|qw
You get a -- -|sd
A jar or something|qy^d
or. -|%
-- well, no,|nn
they have breeders.|sd
Okay.|bk
It's a little plastic things that sort of floats --|sd
Okay.|b
-- and you put the mother fish in there|sd
and then it's got like a trough underneath her --|sd
Okay.|b
-- so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough|sd
and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber --|sd
Oh.|b
And that's, you know, -|%
it kind of works,|sd
but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate --|sd
Right.|b
it'll fit out the slots.|sd
It'll go through the slot.|bf
That's right,|aa
so. But, you know, it works, I guess.|sd
That works all right then.|qy^d
They don't, uh, want the mothers to be with the little fish either.|bf
Oh, they'll eat them.|sd
They will.|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
Isn't that odd.|qy
Yes.|ny
You wouldn't think that.|sv
It, and it's funny because the one I have, every single month without fail she has babies.|sd
You're kidding.|ba
Oh, no.|aa
All the time,|sd
and, um, I, -|%
and she's supposed to, -|%
her variety, it says they won't eat the babies,|sd
and I've seen her do it.|sd
So. -|%
And that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it?|qy
Oh, it's ter-, -|%
well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different|sd
Things are different in the animal kingdom, huh.|bf
We might, right. We might decide what's proper and what isn't,|sd
but --|sv
Yeah.|b
That's kind of the way they do it.|bf
Yeah.|aa
That's it.|aa
Survival of the fittest or something.|bf
Yes,|aa
because if the baby is strong enough, it can swim away fast enough --|sd
Right.|b
Go hide from them,|bf
well --|qh
So. -|%
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
but. If you're like me, you never have enough time for the hobbies.|qy^d
No,|nn
not really.|sd
I, I try.|sd
I also, I play a couple of instruments.|sd
Well, uh, I don't know.|h
I think the budget is really out of hand right now,|sv
and especially in this election year, I think that, uh, there ought to be so-, at least some conversation about what --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering, you know, their token little tax cut program, you know, when it's --|sv
Right.|b
Right,|b
and, uh, well, as you said, mostly they are token cuts.|sv
Uh --|sv
Yeah.|b
The ninety-seven cents a week|sd
Yeah,|aa
ninety-seven cents a week.|aa
Now what, -|%
that's really not going to do a lot of good, it doesn't seem to me, to your average --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Another ninety-seven cents,|sd
hell you can buy a coke or something for that.|sd
Yeah,|b
I mean, mostly it's, it's not actually a, a, a cut,|sv
it's just a cut in the withhold, in the amount withheld, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
Um, yeah|b
I don't see this changing my lifestyle a whole lot.|sv
That ninety-seven cents really isn't going to do it for me either.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Uh, I, I haven't really heard much of what the other people, other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either,|sv
especially the Democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah, maybe that could do something to affect our budget --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
I mean, you know, in retrospect, um, was it, was it Mondale or Dukakis that said, you know, I'll, I'll tell you right now I'm going to raise taxes?|qy
I believe it was Dukakis --|sv
It was Dukakis,|aa
yeah.|aa
-- but I, I can't. -|%
I have a lot of respect for him|sv
Yeah,|aa
I mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said, No,|sv
I will not --|^q
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But it seems to me that, uh, that the budget is so out of hand,|sv
and especially now that they say, Okay, the cold war is over|sv
and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of, you know --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go,|sd
because, in my opinion, I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this peace, so-called peace dividend.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
it's, it's. -|%
I mean, if they could actually put something together and make, -|sd
I'm not really in favor of large government social programs, either, because I feel that they waste --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but with this peace dividend, it seems like you could set up some kind of like --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, yeah,|aa
I, uh, I, I think that would be a great idea, you know, like the conservation corps, you know where. -|sv
Right,|aa
ex-,|aa
It wou-, it wou-, it would help unemployment greatly.|sv
And it. -|%
-- and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country.|sv
Yeah,|aa
infra structure is in, is in, -|%
I mean, we, we, we have hurt ourselves incredibly last fifty years in the --|sv
Yeah,|aa
and --|sv
and I surely don't hear anybody saying that right now.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, yeah,|aa
I, I agree totally|aa
Um, I mean, this, this, it just seems so, you know, so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen.|sv
Um, I, I'm in college right now,|sd
and. -|%
So am I.|sd
Oh really,|b
where do you go?|qw
Uh, I U.|sd
Right,|bk
I go to Georgia Tech, um.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, in, -|%
what, -|%
I had pol-, you know, the required political science class --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And one of the things we discussed was, you know, where our, where the budget situate-, how the budget situation just got so out of hand.|sd
Right.|b
And essentially what happened was, -|%
I think it was like in the, um, tax year of eighty-one, um,|sd
Ronald Reagan basically said, you know, I'm going to give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and, and, created this, this ludicrous budget that he knew, that, that, um, that the Congress would not in their right mind pass --|sd
Right.|b
-- and Con-, Congress, realizing that they were going to lose a, the Democratic Congress realized that they were going to lose a propaganda war, you know, bye-bye, you know, bye-bye removing the tax cut --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
And you just, . -|%
You, you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington.|sv
I mean, it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun.|sv
Yeah,|aa
uh, well, it's, it's more than a loaded, -|%
it's a loaded cannon.|sv
I mean --|sd
Yeah.|b
and they, in my opinion, don't do a very responsible job --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, yeah,|b
um, what really bothers me is it just seems like if, if anyone were to say, you know, well I'm going to raise taxes and cut the budget and we're , we're going to have to do some unpopular things, I mean, he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected.|sv
I mean, it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing, you know --|sv
For, for the moment,|aa
and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said --|^q
Uh-huh.|b
-- or you know, it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It, -|%
I mean, I don't know,|h
I I don't, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week.|sv
No,|aa
no,|aa
not at all.|aa
I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive.|sv
No.|aa
, how do you feel about crime in the city?|qo
You say you're from Atlanta.|sd
Right,|aa
I, I, I actually I live in the city --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I guess it is a concern of mine, uh, you know, for my own safety.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, do you, do you find crime in Atlanta really -|qy
I live in Atlanta also.|sd
Well that's right.|ba
Uh.|%
however I think, the area that I live in it's not, uh, the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the, of the city.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think it seems that there's certain areas where, uh, the crime is focused --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city?|qw
Well, I think it's, what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,|sv
and, uh, --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and probably, um, they need to try to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, I think .|sv
I probably agree with that.|aap_am
Yeah.|b
Uh.|%
You know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they've got to do more than just having, having cops there.|sv
They've got to kind of change the way people think about it.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's probably true.|aap_am
Um, so, um, well do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities?|qy
Um, well, I've been to, -|%
I'd say it's, it's probably in the top, top ten in terms of crime.|na
Um, it's nowhere near as bad as New York City --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Probably not, not as bad as Detroit.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I don't think it's as bad as L A either.|sv
No.|aa
We, I don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that seems to be true.|aa
Um, yeah,|%
if you've ever been to like New York City|%
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
It's that obvious.|sd
Yeah,|b
I don't know,|h
I came to the conclusion also that, you know, just, if you are walking in a downtown area, you know, where there's a lot of crime, a lot of that's going to just, just keeping your senses about you and, and trying not to look like a victim, you know.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
You know, walk bi-, you know, walk with, you know, with --|sv
With a big stick|^2
or.|qy
and, you know, don't, don't be --|sv
Right.|b
Sure.|ba
Right,|aa
don't, don't walk down a, an alley|sv
or don't get -- -|%
Yeah.|b
-- just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, yeah,|%
there are times when you can't avoid all that --|sv
Uh.|%
-- and, and then you're kind of on your own|sv
Yeah.|b
have you, have you ever, have you ever been mugged in Atlanta?|qy
Uh, no.|nn
The only thing I've ever had, was I've had my wallet lifted --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but that was in a more of a, a setting where there was a number of people around,|sd
and I kind of got, -|%
I was much younger at the time --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and kind of a couple of people, they just took it from me without me knowing really --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I've had that happen,|sd
but that's, that's about it.|sd
Yeah,|b
I've been pretty lucky about getting mugged.|sd
Um.|%
Oh, yeah.|b
I think I've only actually seen like one, you know, one actual robbery with a gun --|sd
Um.|%
-- and that's been about the only, you know, real violent crime where, you know, potentially violent crime that I've seen in Atlanta.|sd
Really,|ba
well, I've had my. -|%
And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I've had my car stolen,|sd
so maybe that counts.|sv
Oh, really.|bh
Yeah.|ny
Oh, where was, where, where was that?|qw
Was that downtown|qy
or, -|qy
Oh no,|nn
that was in the northern p-, um, up near Cumberland Mall area.|sd
Really.|ba
It's actually Cobb County,|sd
but it is Atlanta --|sd
Metropolitan,|^2
yeah.|aa
-- and, uh, there's a lot of car thefts in that area.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I've actually, I've known, known some people that have had their cars stolen.|sd
Uh, and, uh, and, you know, about half the time they seem to, the A P D seems to recover them, you know --|sd
Right.|b
Yeah|b
My friend had a V W Rabbit,|sd
and when he, when he got it back his, um, dashboard was sitting in the front seat|sd
Yeah,|b
mine was just, it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage,|sd
but they didn't, they didn't strip it --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so I got it back.|sd
Well, you're probably luckier than. -|sv
Yeah,|aa
than most.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Um, so like does insurance pay for the body damage,|qy
or --|qy
Right.|na
It was about three grand to put everything together.|sd
They cracked the steering column of course, to steal the car.|sd
Yeah,|b
you got to, you crack the steering column|sd
and you pull the, -|sd
there's a pin in there that you can pull on these G M cars --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and you can start it up, basically pretty easily.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So how do you know this much about, um, stealing cars?|qw
Well, after I found mine I had to, I had this, -|sd
Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list|qy
and their either offering a service|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
or they're introducing some new product in the area|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
and normally when they call, you're either in the shower,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
or you're in the middle of cooking something|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
and you have to stop everything to run to the phone.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yes,|ny
yes.|ny
Is, is that one that you're talking about. -|qy
That was the big one I'm talking about.|na
I work weird hours,|sd
and invariably just about the time, I'm going to sleep, the phone tears off the wall.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone,|sd
you either hear, the cli-, as soon as you say hello, you hear the click of the recording coming on,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
or you hear somebody all ready starting, reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already.|sd
That's true,|aa
or the ones that are, are generated by a computer.|sd
It's just a computer voice that comes on the line.|sd
Those are the ones that I really, really hate too.|sd
I've even had some of them,|sd
the, they're voice activated|sd
and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
sometimes I, I get them on my, uh, answering machine at home|sd
so, and I hate that when I've got a whole bunch of messages|sd
and I go through them|sd
and most of them aren't from anybody at all.|sd
What I would love to see done to stop all of this, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
we've got a thing in this country,|sd
you can have your phone number unlisted,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people, -|sv
I think it's great, that you know, freedom of speech in this country and everything, -|sv
but if they're going to offer these services, or these recorded message, everything, they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yes,|aa
see I have an unlisted telephone number,|sd
but I still get all of those calls|sd
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I don't even understand.|sd
So, yeah,|ny
I do,|sd
I really feel that's, uh, an invasion of my privacy.|sd
I agree with you on that particular subject there.|aa
Let me see.|^h
That's about, that as far as any other everyday occurrences,|%
I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door, either religious groups, or people peddling products.|sd
If I wanted their products, I would have either gone to the store to bought it,|sd
or I would have called for their salesman to come out.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
Living in an apartment complex though, you know you can't, um, you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations, uh,|sd
but they still come up to the front door and, uh, you know, walk around.|sd
So, usually what I do is I'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey, there's people coming around, you know,|sd
and they're trying to sell something|sd
or, or they're from a religious organization|sd
and I really hate that.|sd
I really, really do.|sd
I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago|sd
and, uh, gosh it was about nine o'clock at night, too.|sd
It wasn't even what I would consider, you know, family hours,|sd
time to, you know, start going to bed|sd
and uh, and it was somebody from, um, oh what was it, the, uh, Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,|sd
and uh, I've read a lot about, uh, that particular sect|sd
and I don't particularly care for it,|sd
so I especially don't like for them to come up to my door and, and try and talk to me.|sd
Now, I agree with their right to, uh, pursue their religion of choice, in that, whatever manner they want to,|sv
but I think they should also respect the sanctity of the American home, whether it be in a house or in an apartment.|sv
I'm on my turf,|sd
if I want them there, I'll call for them,|sd
otherwise, I don't want to know they exist.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
no,|aa
I, I agree with you there.|aa
If they want to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too, you know, as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in.|sv
And, and I don't like the way that they do it either,|sd
and, and, it's their mission that they do it.|sd
They go door to door|sd
and they go out into the public|sd
and they actually have the, uh, teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work|sd
and, uh, I don't know,|h
I just, um, don't particularly care for that at all.|sd
And that, that's one thing that I feel really strongly about though, is, uh, you know, people coming up to my door, and especially religious organizations and wanting to uh, you know, to try and get me to join or, you know, become interested in their religion,|sv
because I have my own.|sd
Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting,|sd
I've even gone so far as to put that, -|%
I've got a storm door on the front of the house|sd
and I've put, in, -|%
I don't know how much clearer it can be,|sd
it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting.|sd
I should have, I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise, cause I still get, -|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
that's true,|aa
yeah.|aa
No|aa
I don't, uh, I don't have, I didn't go that far|sd
but, uh, yeah|%
I probably could do the same thing, uh, you know,|sv
I don't have a storm door,|sd
but I'm sure I could rig up something.|sd
But you know I don't think that that would stop people.|sv
I, it's like they see that word|sv
and it says go instead of stop.|sv
Oh, goodness.|ba
and then reverse it,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
and do, -|%
well that would be technically illegal,|sd
it would be harassment.|sd
Oh gosh.|ba
But, I consider an invasion of my privacy,|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
that's true,|aa
that's true, um.|aa
Well what else?|qo
I believe we've pretty much summed everything up.|sv
I know,|aa
but I remember you, you talked about something,|^h
you started off and said, -|^h
well let me think,|^h
you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door.|^h
You said something else.|^h
I can't remember what it was,|^h
and I thought yeah,|sd
that, that kind of touched a nerve right there,|sd
but we got uh, we got to talking about the, uh, uh, people coming to you at the front door.|sd
I'm drawing a blank.|^h
Oh goodness,|ba
okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
is our five minutes up?|qy
Uh, pretty close to it.|na
Pretty close.|b^m
Well I've enjoyed talking with you.|fc
Well it was nice talking to you too Jim.|fc
And take it easy now.|fc
Okay,|fc
thanks,|fc
bye.|fc
Good night.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
so we've got to talk about music.|ad
Okay.|aa
And, um, do you like classic rock, or modern rock, or which kind?|qy
No,|ba
not a seventies baby.|qy
so that's really what I like better,|sd
is that kind of music|sd
I mean, -|%
Is it disco,|qy
or is it like, -|qrr
No,|nn
no,|nn
no,|nn
not that kind of music|sd
but, -|%
No,|nn
more like, uh, rock, um, you know, like Led Zepplin type|sd
Oh, okay.|b
So, so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin.|bf
Right.|b
Yeah,|aa
that's cool.|aa
Right.|b
And, how about the Rolling Stones?|qy
Oh, sure,|ba
sure|ba
I went to their concert last year when they were here.|sd
Oh, that's when, that's when they took, toured.|sd
How about, um, Pink Floyd?|qy
Sure,|na
yeah,|ny
I like them.|sd
Okay.|bk
So, so then we got, we got some same things|sv
because, -|%
Okay,|b
well, I just didn't know that much about music|sd
and I wasn't sure what kind of music.|sd
No,|aa
it's very hard|sv
because, see, well, I mean, in the whole spectrum I'd rather listen, you know, -|%
I listen to heavy metal or classic rock.|sd
What, what kind of heavy metal are we talking about?|qw
What, -|%
We're talking about what they, what they call hard rock.|sd
Okay,|bk
like, give me some examples.|ad
Like, for example, let's see, uh, Bad Company,|sd
what, -|%
Oh, well, Bad Cam-, Company's not bad,|sv
that's not,|%
well, they're like, for example, A C D C.|sd
Yeah,|b
A C D C|b^m
Why,|qo
have you heard of them?|qy
Yes|ny
Okay.|bk
And, stuff like that.|sd
That's, that's,|sv
Well, okay.|b
Okay,|ba
I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal.|sv
Okay.|bk
I mean, I, I think, when you say heavy metal, I'm, I'm thinking about like Cinderella, you know.|sd
Well, Cinderella is, is hard rock, heavy metal.|sd
Well, see, I don't really care for Cinderella|sd
But, I like A C D C's okay.|sd
But, see, for example, they have, see what, -|sd
but other bands consider it like really hard rock.|sd
It's like brash metal, which all they do is like, they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar,|sd
and the guitar is set like, really low,|sd
Yeah.|b
No,|b
I don't really care for that too much, I guess.|sd
and, what happens is like, oh, everybody gets like totally into the music|sd
and then they start dancing around,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they just bump into each other,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
like, like they hit each other with their shoulders,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, then, you knock people down,|sd
and what you do is, you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people.|sd
Is that the kind of music that you like?|qy
No,|nn
I don't like that music.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
But, that's, that's what they do.|sd
That's, that's what some people call like really heavy metal.|sd
Oh, okay.|b
And, see, the difference, I guess, between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also.|sd
Like really, like heavy metal, wo-, is considered, like the words heavy metal|sd
and, like, you always thought about, like, suicide. And killing people and stuff like that.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, just hard rock has, -|%
they, they don't talk about that,|sd
they just talk about, like, life in general.|sd
Right.|b
Like, Queen's Reich, if you ever heard of them.|qy^d
Oh, sure.|na
Of course.|na
Yeah.|b
Que-, you, you're talking Queen,|bf
is that what you said?|br
Okay,|b
well, no.|ar
I said Queen's Reich,|sd
but,|sv
Oh, oh, oh, okay,|bk
Right.|b
So because, -|%
Well sure,|b
because Queen was real popular when I was growing up.|sd
Yeah,|b
especially, uh, oh God, what is it, A Night At The Opera?|h
Don't they have a, -|qy
no|ar
let's see, the one that they have the, the whole opera singing in the background.|qw^d
Oh!|ba
Bo, Bo, Bohemian Rhapsody.|sd
right,|aa
yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Yeah,|b
that, that was great.|sv
I heard that the other day on the radio|sd
and I pumped it up.|sd
Because, I mean, I just love that song.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that, that was a real good one.|sv
Yeah,|b
but they had, -|%
that, that whole record was pretty good.|sv
But then, they started going downhill like everybody else.|sv
Well, that's true.|aa
They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that.|sv
Yeah,|b
they're, they're still around,|sd
they've got a ne-, new C D out,|sd
but I, I wouldn't buy it.|sd
Because see, what happens is, the old, see whe-, -|sd
I like, I like the old Rolling Stones.|sd
I don't like the new stuff.|sd
Of the Stones?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Yeah.|aa
I agree.|aa
That's the ne-, -|%
the older stuff is the best of it.|sv
The, the new stuff's kind of more like, today's rock and roll, which I,|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, for example, I used to like old Phil Collins.|sd
Right.|b
Yes,|aa
definitely.|aa
I agree.|aa
And, and, then what happened was that Phil Collins said, hey I can make money, a lot of money doing this,|sd
and then he came out with, uh, see, for example, his, his record like, No Jacket Required.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That was good,|sv
but it was on his way of going downhill,|sv
because he said, I can make a lot of money just singing alone,|sd
and then he came out with the Invisible Touch, with, uh, Genesis|sd
and that really, -|%
like now, I hate Phil Collins,|sd
I can't stand him.|sd
Right.|b
Because, I look at him|sd
and I say, you know, you were singing at this time, and with these people,|sd
and you were great,|^q
and now you're singing all this stuff that, doesn't matter what you, what you sing or what you record,|^q
it's still going to be a number one hit.|^q
And so, that's, that's what gets me mad.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, did, did you go see that new Doors movie?|qy
No,|nn
not yet.|sd
I guess I've been, con-, kind of considering it.|sd
Have you seen it yet?|qy
Yeah.|ny
I saw it when it opened.|sd
Was it really good?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|na
And, they both loved the movie, right?|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They said the music's great,|sd
it took me back to the sixties, and stuff like that.|^q
Uh-huh.|b
And then, one of them said, well, everything is great,|sd
but I'm going to give it thumbs down.|^q
And they go,|sd
but why?|^q
Because it's like, the end is, like, really depressing.|sd
And so, -|%
Oh.|b
But it, but it's like the movie is so well made,|sv
and the music that goes with it just picks you up, see, -|sv
I was never, I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine.|sd
Oh, okay.|b
So, I mean, so for me, -|%
So, you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then.|bf
No,|aa
but you learn to.|sd
I mean it's just that, like the, the sixties music's got a lot to say.|sv
Right.|b
I, I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too.|sd
You know, I was like, -|%
Well no,|ar
I've never liked disco.|sd
Hey,|ba
but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants,|sv
Well, that's true|aa
That's true.|aa
But, I was more in the late seven-, -|sd
well, I shou-, -|%
like mid to late seventies, like between seventy-five and,|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Did, did you go to college?|qy
Well, no.|nn
I'm going right now|sd
Oh, that's cool.|ba
But uh, no|nn
I didn't go then.|sd
But see, I graduated high school in seventy-eight,|sd
Okay.|b
so, you know, in seventy-eight, you know rock was starting to get really heavy, you know,|sd
and real, um,|h
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
disco was pretty much dead by then.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, so that's what I mean,|sd
disco wasn't really my time.|sd
Well, they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in, in progression, ever in history.|sd
So, -|%
About music?|br
No,|ar
about everything.|sd
Oh. Okay.|b
So, it's like, nothing happened during the seventies.|sd
Everything happened during the sixties,|sd
the seventies I don't know what they're called, you know,|sd
it's like, like -|%
the, the eighties are called, like the progressive years, or the, or, you know, like the technology years,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But the seventies got nothing.|sd
I mean, nobody cared to name it|sd
That's kind of funny|ba
So.|%
You're right.|aa
I never thought of that.|sd
The disco years, that's what they're calling them,|sd
Yeah,|aa
I know.|aa
Can you imagine the, like a big picture of John Travolta, ta-da, what is it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER?|qo
Him just standing there.|sv
Yeah,|aa
right.|aa
Yeah,|b
that's a good example to look for in history.|sv
Well, from now on we're going to go from the, from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon, to nineteen eighties.|^q
Okay,|^q
what happened in the middle?|^q
Don't worry,|^q
don't worry,|^q
you're not, you're not missing anything, you know,|^q
so, -|%
That's true.|aa
Well, except for Vietnam.|arp_nd
Yeah,|aa
really.|aa
And, that's,|%
You know with, -|%
yeah,|b
it's like they don't want to talk about that,|sv
so they just, don't name it.|sv
I mean, it was, it was, I guess it was pretty bad times.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Well, that's very true|aa
But, -|%
Oh, well, let's see,|^h
yeah,|%
okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
we've been talking for seven minutes,|sd
so, -|%
Oh, good.|ba
I haven't even been keeping track.|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
all right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
so um, I'm going to leave you alone.|oo_co_cc
Uh what, what are you doing?|qw
Do you have a family?|qy
Uh, yeah.|ny
Okay.|bk
We're kind of, I was kind of in the middle of supper,|sd
but it's not a big deal,|bd
Oh, I'm sorry.|fa
I just left it.|bd
No,|ar
it's okay,|bd
because see I didn't, see -|%
somebody tried to call me last night|sd
but I didn't have my number yet,|sd
I just got it today.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
And so, you know, it's okay.|bd
I, I told them I'd be available during this time,|sd
so,|%
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
So then, uh, have fun doing this.|fc
It is not,|fc
Okay,|fc
thanks.|fc
Bye, bye.|fc
Great,|fc
Bye.|fc
All right, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I think the topic was crime in the city.|sd
Right.|aa
I do not live in a city.|sd
I live in a real small little place.|sd
Where is that?|qw
Uh, it's about thirty miles from Sherman.|sd
North, south, east, or west?|qy
It's north of Sherman.|sd
Well, you live almost in Oklahoma|sv
Not too far.|aap_am
Yeah .|b
That's kind of ironic, because I don't live too far from Oklahoma either.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
You know where Saint Joe is?|qy
Uh, I've been through there.|na
I'm about eight miles south of it.|sd
Okay.|bk
Oh, yeah.|b
I had been through Saint Joe,|sd
but, um, just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that, it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad.|sv
Well, you know, I've, I've seen those statistics and everything,|sd
and you know, what frightens me, is that, you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert --|sv
Huh-uh.|b
I mean, the Iraqis didn't have a lot of high-tech weaponry,|sd
but they had mortars and machine guns,|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Sure.|b
And, they didn't kill as many people in, in forty-five days,|sd
and they were intending to kill people,|sd
Huh-uh.|b
I mean, that was their job, as they killed in Washington D C.|sv
Oh, I know,|aa
I know.|aa
I know.|aa
Um, I think nowadays people just, really just, murder is nothing to them, you know.|sv
Well, I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years, I guess.|sd
And, I've come to the conclusion, and this is a pretty scary thought to me, even, that if a guy is convicted, or a gal is convicted, of a crime, rather than put them in prison, because prison's proven not to work, just let them go.|sv
Say okay, you're convicted --|sd
Huh-uh.|b
-- and just let them go --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and if they get convicted again, well, just kill them.|sv
Yeah,|aa
because, uh, most likely that will happen, won't it, that, you know, -|sv
Well, I think that the best hope to eliminate crime, as we know it today --|sv
Huh-uh.|b
Huh-uh.|b
If someone is known to have been in prison, they can't get a job.|sv
No.|aa
You know.|%
Yeah.|b
They can't be accepted into society.|sv
You know, if they're not going to be accepted into society, then everybody's going to become sociopathic.|sv
Huh-uh.|b
And, you know, who's to put the limit on it?|qh
I mean, I was watching a thing last night, up in Washington State.|sd
If you get convicted of, uh, sexual offenses, on a regular basis -|%
You know, I mean, some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
And they're still let out on the street after one or two years.|sd
Well, in Washington State, if you're a habitual sexual offender, they just don't let you out.|sd
Um.|b
So you serve your prison term,|sd
and then you go into the mental hospital,|sd
and if you're pronounced cured, they'll let you go.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Well, they may find a cure for it,|sv
but there is no known cure now.|sd
Um. So you're, you're kind of thinking, -|bf
in other words, if you get, if you do something the first time, that's not real bad, you know,|bf
Hey , people make mistakes.|sv
yeah,|b
to go ahead and let them go,|bf
but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then, uh. -|bf
Well, yeah,|aa
use that|sv
or, you know, there's other consequences rather than killing them, you know,|sv
you could,|sv
Oh.|b
Huh-uh.|b
You know.|%
Yeah.|b
At least they might have get some benefit in that,|sv
and if the people they committed a crime against, feel, at some later date, that these people have learned their lesson, are, are okay, you know, well, they can free them.|sv
Huh-uh.|b
But, uh, you know, with the technology we have today, you can put a collar on a guy's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property.|sd
I mean, it will just in incapacitate them.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
And, you can put a collar around a guy's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
But, you know, putting them in prison, my God, that doesn't work.|sv
No,|aa
apparently not,|aa
because look how many years they've been doing that|sv
and look|%
I mean, yeah.|%
Well, you look at places like Turkey.|ad
Turkey has the death penalty,|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Huh-uh.|b
I mean, if you get convicted of, uh, you know, drug trafficking, they just kill you.|sd
You get convicted of, uh, you know, heinous crimes, they just kill you.|sd
I mean there's no two ways about it.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
And, uh, you look at their society|ad
and the repeat offenders are very few.|sv
You know, and you look at our society, almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison, has been in prison three or four times.|sv
Three or four times,|aa
yeah.|aa
I mean,|sv
That is true,|aa
I know.|aa
Yeah.|aa
One, you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven.|sv
I, I think that's very important.|sv
Oh, I'm, I agree very much so on that,|aa
I, -|%
yeah.|aa
And then, if a parent has proved to be unfit, for any reason --|sv
Huh-uh.|b
Yeah.|b
Because, you know, we are what we teach.|sv
Huh-uh.|b
Because that's what our society becomes.|sv
We have,|sd
comes,|aa
yeah.|aa
and I've, and I've, I've lived in that, that environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work.|sd
You know, and these guys, they come to work every morning|sd
and they're stoned to the bone.|sd
I mean, their so high, they could fly up to the top of that building *spelling: they're|sd
and they work all day,|sd
and they go home|sd
and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs|sd
and when they run out of money, they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money,|sd
and then they go back to work on Monday.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
And, the kids of these people .|%
Sure,|b
they just think that's the normal thing to do, don't they ...|qy
They're sociopathic.|no
Yeah.|b
And I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester --|sd
Huh-uh.|b
-- and these kids were more foulmouthed than I've ever been.|sd
I had one kid threaten my life,|sd
In the first grade|ba
Told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death.|sd
Oh, know|sv
You know, and they flipping me the finger and all that --|sd
Huh-uh.|b
-- and I just said to this kid, -|sd
I said, you got two choices kid,|sd
you can step into mainstream society|^q
or you can die.|^q
Huh-uh.|b
Because you will eventually be killed.|^q
And, I just, I'm just totally aghast at a what's going on.|sd
Oh, I know.|aa
I know, um,|aa
I work in school. You know,|sd
that's something I do|sd
and I, it really is -|%
I'm like you|sv
astonishing what the younger ages know,|sv
and they react to what they see at home. You know.|sv
Huh-uh.|b
If they see violence at home, that's what you're going to get from the kids at school.|sv
Exactly.|aa
You know. It really is,|sv
and that's kind of sad.|sv
Well, you can see it in the work place, you know.|sv
Used to be when you had a personality conflict you just, you worked with it|sd
and you got through it.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Now, you know, people get fired,|sd
or what's even worse, is they promote them into a position that they can't handle and let them get fired.|sd
Yeah.|b
Or, one thing or the other.|h
You look at another kind of society like the Japanese.|ad
You put that many people on that small of a space, they've learned to live together.|sv
Okay.|%
It's in their culture.|sv
Huh-uh.|b
And one of the things that's in their culture that I really think the major corporations should pay attention to, is the fact that, while Japan was becoming a great power, financially, the people that worked for those companies, worked for the same company they worked for at sixty-five, as they did when they were eighteen.|sv
Teen.|b^m
And the company, took it upon itself to find a position for these people.|sd
If they weren't fit for the job they were hired for, they didn't just can them,|sd
they made a position for them some where.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
You look at Frito Lay.|ad
My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist.|sd
You know, transcribing stuff into the computer.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Well, she could type about one-hundred and five words per minute,|sd
but she don't like it.|sd
She just doesn't like to do that.|sd
I mean, she will.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, you know, her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is have ... -|sd
Um, what kind of hobbies do you have?|qw
Um, I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting, when I do have spare time.|sd
Really,|b
I like cross-stitch too.|sd
Oh, I love it.|sd
I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately.|sd
That's my case also.|aa
I've got a new born|sd
and there's just no time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Have you been cross-stitching long?|qy
Oh, several years.|sd
My husband is even interested in it now.|sd
He likes to help me design, um, you know, projects that are,|sd
Oh, really.|b
Mine, sort of, he looks at the pattern|sd
and he says how do you get that from there to the material|sd
Not that hard.|sv
Oh, it's not.|aa
I really enjoy it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I do a lot of my own patterns also.|sd
Yeah.|b
In fact, I did one, BILL THE CAT, you know, from Glenn County --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
It was tough,|sd
but, uh, yeah.|%
Do you have any others,|qy
or is this mainly cross-stitching?|qy
Um, I do mostly that, um,|sd
not very artistic really for like painting and stuff.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
Um,|%
But, now I don't know.|sd
I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors|sd
Oh, really|b
Yeah,|b
I've got the kits to put them all in.|sd
I don't have them all yet --|sd
Yeah,|aa
right.|aa
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|b
I got to counting the other day|sd
and, uh, I think I have, what was it two hundred,|sd
and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this is, uh, -|sd
it, yeah, it can add up quick.|sd
Oh, yeah.|aa
I just, I just keep an inventory of what I currently have,|sd
and then when I start a new project, I go through and see if I, if I, you know, -|sd
just buy the colors that I need --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
I see.|ba
Well, now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead, you know, what comes close.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|aa
A lot of times you can do that.|sv
I think, I -|%
the pinks, there's like forty-two different shades of pink.|sd
Good grief|ba
Yeah,|b
there's lots of pinks and greens.|sd
Pinks and greens.|b^m
Yeah.|b
There's lots of shades of greens.|sd
But the colors, -|%
I just love all the different colors.|sd
Yeah.|b
They had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to.|sd
But, you don't have much spare time either?|qy
Well, not lately|ng
I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there.|sd
Oh, yes.|bk
And that does take some time.|sv
And if we're trying to get acclimated with the, uh, with having a baby,|sd
and . -|%
Yeah.|b
How old?|qw
He's seven months old.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
And just into everything,|sd
so there's not a spare moment.|sd
Oh, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.|sd
I've been trying to do some bibs for him.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
We missed it last year,|sd
so hopefully this year he'll have one.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, last year he was a little bit young for having one.|sv
Right.|aa
He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway|sv
You would have|sv
but, -|%
Right.|aa
If it tasted good, yeah.|sd
All he liked was the lights this year,|sd
so. -|%
Oh, yeah.|b
Oh, well, that's neat that you like cross-stitching also.|ba
Yeah,|aa
that's, that's kind of strange that we got the same call.|sv
Yeah.|b
It's a call.|sv
Oh, I'm sorry.|fa
Go ahead.|ad
No,|ar
that's okay.|bd
Okay uh,|aa
but, yeah,|%
I've been doing it for probably ten years or so.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
No,|%
I just started about, well, five years ago, I think.|sd
But it is peaceful,|sv
I mean it is relaxing to do, once you find the time to do it.|sv
Uh-huh|b
There's also a couple of large projects, baby afghans,|sd
and I got one done|sd
and I think the other one is going. The child is going to be in high school before I get finished.|sd
On that, uh -- -|%
Bear thing .|%

I didn't, um, I didn't buy the, uh, I didn't buy a kit.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
Well I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's that cloth.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
It's an-, cloth I think.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it has the borders and everything already.|sd
Yeah.|b
Those are pretty.|ba
Number one turned out just great,|sd
and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors, that they had decorated the nursery|sd
and I didn't even know it.|sd
Oh, that's a . -|ba
I gave it to her|sd
and she said how did you know those are the colors we used.|sd
I said didn't|sd
That was a good . -|ba
It worked out that way.|sd
That's great.|ba
Uh, that, uh, -|%
now I've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I like those.|sd
Those are pretty.|sv
Yeah.|b
Lilly, Lilly , she said, she said it's for your daughter to use.|sd
Oh, no.|ar
She said, I know she doesn't get to touch it.|sd
She hung it on the wall.|sd
Yes,|b
my, uh, grandmother, um, made us a couple of quilts for the baby,|sd
and I was like, oh, I don't want to mess those up.|sd
Yeah|b
Uh, they're just too nice.|sv
I mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore.|sv
Yeah.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
True.|aa
Well, I've enjoyed this.|fc
Okay.|fc
But, uh, well keep up the good, um,|fc
keep up the cross-stitching.|fc
You too.|fc
All right,|fc
thanks.|fc
Uh-huh,|fc
bye bye.|fc
Bye bye.|fc
Well, this is a good subject, isn't it?|qy
Yeah.|ny
It's, it's something that you can really talk about.|sv
Yeah.|b
Um, I don't know what we're going to do about it,|sd
but,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Um, you know, when they say the Middle East,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and there's so many different problems there.|sd
Uh, what do you want to concentrate on.|qw
It doesn't matter to me.|sd
Well, uh, I'll tell you something,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
um, I, I have a sister-in-law from Israel,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, and they're really quite, uh, arrogant about it all.|sd
They, they believe that they, they belong there|sd
and they've belonged there forever,|sd
and, the Palestinians and the Arabs are, uh, more or less, -|sd
they, they consider them second class.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, they're really quite arrogant about it.|sd
I don't, uh, I don't know if that contributes to the problem.|sd
Well how did they feel about the, uh, the United States interven-, intervening with Patriot missiles,|qw
did, did they, -|%
Oh, uh, I'm, I'm sure this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers, the Americans,|sv
Uh-huh|b
but, I didn't really talk about that with her.|sd
She, um, um, my sister-in-law now lives in, um, Switzerland.|sd
Oh.|b
But, um, when they were living in Israel, it was, it was, the, the Palestinians, they, they come in an, -|sd
and they're, they're nothing but really servants for them,|sd
and they really treat them like second class citizens.|sd
They, they don't really want them around|sd
but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But they, they really do,|sd
they look down on them.|sd
And, I don't know, being, -|%
I, I live in, uh, Vermont|sd
and being up here we pretty much treat everybody, you know, as someone that has merit, even if they're poor, or if they're Hispanic or if they're black.|sd
We give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and, all the hurt in the big cities, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I-, if I lived in Washington, D C I think I'd have a different attitude about Black people|sd
because I've heard that it, it, the, they're terrible, you know,|sd
it's just like it's a dog eat dog world.|sv
And here, you know, all, all my black friends are professionals|sd
and they're, they don't, you know, they don't go out and abuse drugs|sd
and they, they send their kids to school|sd
and they, they, they uh, you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So it's just a different world.|sv
Well I live in San Antonio|sd
and fifty percent of the population is minority.|sd
Oh, um, I talked to someone about San Antonio,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, um, they said that they, they have, you have quite the problem with, uh, the ghettos,|sd
I don't know,|h
do they call it the barrio down there.|qy
That's the barrios|na
but i-, it's, it's I don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city.|sv
It's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks.|sv
Yeah,|b
but I heard that sa-, San Antonio, unlike like, like a city like San Diego it se-, it just has a really bad problem.|sd
I grew up outside of Houston|sd
and I don't think, uh, as far as gang violence and things, I don't think it's any worse here than in Houston.|sv
Yeah,|b
like say Houston.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Now I would, now me not even knowing anything about Houston, I would think that it's a pretty calm city.|sv
Houston is not at all.|ar
No, huh,|qy
there's a lot of crime?|qy
Yes|ny
there's quite a bit of crime.|sd
Oh, my, um, -|ba
yeah,|b
like I, wer-, we're so protected up here,|sv
it's, it's really strange.|sv
I mean our red light district, I mean, uh, you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life, you know,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we're just so protected.|sv
But, it's, it's, over in the Mid East, especially Israel, it's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system, when it comes to the Palestinians.|sd
You know, the Israelis can do anything they want|sd
but when it comes to Palestinians, if they're out in the street at night, it's, it's really looked on as odd.|sd
Um, usually they're, they're bussed in to the, the, um, Jewish neighborhoods, and the Jewish cities|sd
and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories.|sd
Huh.|b
So they don't have that.|sd
But, uh, what do you think about the mess that's, we've created in Iraq?|qo
I think it's unfortunate, uh, as far as the Kurds are concerned,|sd
it, -|%
I thi-, -|%
It's just what do you do for them,|sv
you want to do something for them,|sv
but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the, the country.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
we can't get involved in their civil war, um, unfortunately,|sv
but we've kind of driven these people out.|sv
To do it,|aa
yeah,|aa
but you see President Bush is telling them rebel, you know, uh, uprise.|sd
And that's what they did|sd
and now they're like asking him for help|sd
and he's like, no we can't get involved.|sd
What my husband had very strong feelings, -|sd
he, uh, agreed with, um, the General Schwartzkopf,|sd
he said, um, he should have let, Bush should have let him finish his job.|sd
Sure.|ba
He should, he should have let them, um, corner the Republican Guards,|sd
Well I think the war ended too soon.|sv
Yeah,|aa
exactly,|aa
that's what everyone says.|sd
Yeah.|b
E-, everyone I talk to, they says, you know, -|sd
it's real easy to say that.|sv
We, we didn't damage enough of their arsenal.|sv
We damaged most of it|sd
but we, we should have gotten, made sure we got everything.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I don't think the higher ups were thinking about wh-, what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine.|sv
They're going, oh, well it's not going to hurt us|sv
so we're just going to let them go,|^q
but really we didn't think about the people that he was going, tr-, -|sv
and I mean, he, he's just, -|%
Unfortunately though, the, the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait.|sd
And once that was accomplished it, -|sd
They, yeah, they, they did, they stuck right to their goals,|sd
Yeah.|b
and right,|%
what they were going to say.|sd
And the American people, when this first started, they were even reluctant to let them do that.|sd
Yeah.|b
So they were, they were playing it very safe,|sv
but, you know, it, an ounce what do they say, an ounce of hind sight is worth, whatever.|sv
Yeah.|b
Th-, they, I don't know, they, it, Schwartz-, Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done|sd
and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it, to you know, the, uh, the go ahead to do it.|sv
Yeah.|b
Because he had the fu-, -|%
he knew what was going to happen, more than any of us.|sd
it was going to make such a mess.|sd
I mean I feel really sorry for these people,|sd
these people are middle class people, just like us.|sd
Can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood,|qh
Yeah.|b
and you knew this,|qh
these people are going to come|sd
and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you.|sd
Of course, you're going, just going pick everything up that you can carry|sv
and you're going to run.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And it, it's just too bad that we couldn't see that.|sv
I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet. That I, I still feel like there's more to come.|sv
I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned.|sv
Well you know what I was hoping?|qh
I was hoping Iran was going to take a very, um, dramatic stand and invade, you know,|sd
and then like Iran's the big bad guy, you know,|sd
but, really, if, if they were going to save people's lives, -|%
They've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I know,|aa
it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict|sv
but, I, I, you know, I almost swear, I'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians,|sd
why they didn't go save, -|%
I mean, I don't know if the Kurdish, -|%
I know the Shiites are their people.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, I don't know,|h
I think they have a bond with the, the Kurds.|sv
There are some Kurds living in Iran.|sd
Yeah,|b
I, I think they should have just done more, uh,|sv
and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid.|sv
It's, it's just so complicated.|sv
I was real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as, as much as they did.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
well, you, -|%
knowing them, they're very, um, oh, -|%
I don't know,|h
almost compare them to a very egotistical man.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You're damn right,|aa
I'm going to protect my family, you know,|sd
so, I, I was amazed too.|sd
I was really, I was really, um, proud of them, though, that they stayed out of it.|sd
But, -|%
Yeah,|b
it and from, from what I can tell if they had gotten into it, it would have started a whole new war.|sv
Oh yeah,|b
I was, I -|%
that part scared me.|sd
That, that, um, the Egyptians would pull out|sd
and I just saw atomic bomb,|sv
Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um,|sd
I, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on|sd
and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening.|sd
Yeah.|b
Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.|sv
That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about,|sd
because I, because we never went to war.|sd
I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out|sv
and I,|sv
Right.|b
And I, I guess I see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had, where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for, for what was happening.|sd
Right.|b
You know, I just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman|sd
and I'm not sure that's our role,|sv
but. -|%
Yeah,|aa
I, I agree with that,|aa
I was, I was fairly young at the time too,|sd
I, I really don't have very many memories about it at all, in fact.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, my husband is a Vietnam veteran|sd
and i-, you know, he in looking at the Persian Gulf war that just went on, he, -|%
i-, it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have, from the people or the administration, either one.|sd
of static throughout Don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time?|qy
I mean I do think that, i-, i-, it's been too long in coming|sv
but I feel like maybe the American people and, and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that|sv
Right.|b
so many people were opposed to the war,|sd
what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it|sd
and those guys were there doing their duty.|sd
That's right,|aa
I mean, they weren't there by choice|sv
and, and, -|%
Yeah,|b
and I, I think that we learned from that|sv
and I think it, it's one of those things that you learn the hard way.|sv
It was a tragic mistake,|sv
Right.|b
the way that they have been treated over the years and I believe that's just now turning around. Just now, you know, trying to be rectified|sv
and I'm, and I'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally,|sv
Right.|b
No,|aa
I don't think you can|aa
and I, I agree with you that I, I think that the, the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in, in, in every aspect of it|sv
and I, I agree with you also, that I feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war.|sv
I mean they're still not settled over there.|sv
No,|aa
they're not.|aa
And I have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way.|sv
Yeah.|b
I think we're going to end up back there in a few years or, if, if not sooner.|sv
Well I, I appreciate the fa-, -|%
I feel like President Bush is in a hard spot.|sv
He went over there to get them out of Kuwait, which he did.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then he has backed out,|sd
he has pulled out.|sd
And I realize they're still saying, well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein,|sd
so why aren't you helping us?|^q
And you see, I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation.|sv
I think it would too.|aa
And I don't think the U S will stand for it.|sv
I don't think he would do that,|sv
No,|aa
uh, I think we learned too much --|sv
Yeah,|aa
I agree with that.|aa
Uh, you know whether it was justified or not, I know, that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause.|sv
I, I feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but, but I think somewhere that got lost.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
and, -|%
We-, you have to, i-, you know, you have to give Bush a lot of credit for he, he said that's what we were going there to do|sv
and he did what, what he said|sd
and he did pull out before it got any further than that where,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
I mean, th-, my, my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries|sd
and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address.|sv
That we don't get fixed.|bf
That's right.|aa
I know.|aa
And, and tha-, that's what frustrates me more than anything.|sd
And I, I believe that we have to have a military|sv
and I believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us.|sv
Right.|b
But I also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward.|sv
I think there's a lot of waste|sv
and, and they don't, i-, if they could just cut out all the fat and, and get it lean, and start addressing some of the other issues,|sv
I think we could take care of everything. And quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world,|sv
Ye-, -|b
I know,|aa
I do think that in the Middle East war, um, -|%
I think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with, uh, kind of a different attitude.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more.|sv
Right.|b
An, uh, and I think that's good, you know,|sv
Yeah.|b
I think that's a good,|sv
Yeah,|aa
a lot of good has come from this one.|sv
I think so too.|aa
And I think, I guess, in, in, uh, ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war|sv
because like we, we said earlier, that, you know, the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of, of that war|sv
and and, -|%
And perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam.|sv
Right,|aa
exactly.|aa
So, I, I, I do think that, we've learned from it,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
you know, I, I, I wish there weren't war|sd
Yeah,|aa
no kidding.|aa
But, uh, I do think we learned.|sv
And I just, I just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid,|sd
Yes.|aa
I mean, it was, they're, they still don't know what they were there for.|sv
No,|aa
there was no feeling of accomplishment, no goal,|sv
no,|aa
No.|aa
we went in|sd
but what did we do.|qh
We lost lives|sd
and, and what were we trying to do.|qh
Who knows.|qh
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
And, I, I think you're right,|aa
uh, I think you're right there.|aa
Um, I do remember when it was over.|sd
I remember when they were coming home.|sd
Uh, but, I remember the feeling back then, you know,|sd
like I feel like right now, I feel like this country has been behind this war.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, yeah,|b
there's a lot of people that aren't for war.|sd
I'm not for war,|sd
Right.|b
but I believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right.|sv
I don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam.|sd
Right.|b
I just remember,|%
oh yeah,|^q
our guys are over there|^q
and it's sad|^q
and we shouldn't be fighting a war|^q
but there was no, let's support them, you know.|sd
Right,|b
we-, -|%
the, -|%
when this war broke out it frustrated me all thi-, the antiwar people and, you know,|sd
Yeah.|b
I felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity|sv
because those kind of people, I mean, you know, they're the kind of people who are, who've always got to have a cause, whether it's good, bad of indifferent.|sv
They've got to have a cause|sv
and,|sv
Yo-, you have to support the people that are there.|sv
That's right.|aa
And som-, for some reason those people don't see that.|sv
They don't see it as supporting the folks, the people.|sv
No,|aa
no,|aa
they don't|aa
and, you know, they're just real shallow people.|sv
I would agree with you there|aa
Yeah.|b
I, I agree.|aa
Um, and I, and I recall when President Bush said that, you know,|sd
he said look,|sd
I, you know, I'm sorry that you're opposed to the war.|^q
There's a lot of us that are opposed to war|^q
but, uh, you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing.|^q
And I remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that.|sd
Yeah,|b
But, -|%
I mean they're not helping anybody.|sv
That's the, that's the whole point,|sv
Th-, not.|%
they're not doing anything for anybody except themselves.|sv
That's true.|aa
And I don't even know what they're doing for themselves.|sv
Uh.|b
Giving a soapbox to stand on|sd
Yeah|b
But, well, I just, I, I'm glad we've learned.|sd
I'm sorry we had the experience of Vietnam.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, and I'm, I'm, I'm especially sorry for the people that are, you know, have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally,|sd
because, you know until the la-, past four or five years, nobody ever really worried about that,|sv
That's true.|aa
Yeah.|b
And, and I think that's where we as American people really failed, you know, failed them.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
So, I don't know.|h
Well, do you have anything else you want to say on this?|qy
No,|nn
I guess not.|sd
I think this is the first time that I haven't been cut off by the computer|sd
I know,|aa
we get cut off all the time, too|sd
Usually I can talk all day|sd
but this is something to me that's sad|sd
Yeah,|aa
it is.|aa
So, well have a good day|fc
and I appreciate the conversation.|fc
Thanks,|fc
same here.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
So the general topic is hobbies.|sd
Yes.|aa
Let's hear about your hobbies.|ad
Well, let's see,|^h
what kind of hobbies do I have?|qw
I guess, uh, I, it's more not so much a hobby but things I enjoy doing.|sd
I enjoy playing basketball and, and basically all kinds of sports.|sd
And, uh, -|%
Any handicrafts?|qy
Excuse me.|br
Any handicrafts?|qy
No,|nn
not, not really, um,|sd
no,|nn
I'm really not too creative|sd
well, I, uh, you know, around with my hands and things like that -|sd
I leave that more up to my Mom|sd
So, um, I think I'm in handicraft.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
I think it will become resume writing.|sd
Oh, well, let's hope that you, you aren't employed by that craft for too long.|ba
Uh, yeah,|aa
I, I hate to think about it|sd
and, and I'm getting rather good at reading want ads.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
it, it, -|%
Wh-, what kind of time frame is it, uh, looking for the, uh, different shifts up there?|qw
I -|%
who knows.|qh
Is it, uh, -|%
basically, I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it, Texas,|sd
No,|ar
all means about fifteen to twenty percent,|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
I'm sure the number's s-, somewhere classified|sd
but some of the internal news and the news services, -|sd
so, it's approximately six fifty,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so ten percent of six fifty, is sixty-five|sd
and twenty percent would be one thirty.|sd
Wow,|ba
how about that.|bh
Yeah,|b
that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's possible.|aap_am
How about that.|bh
Well, that's, uh, that's unfortunate|ba
is there many other, -|%
are you in the defense?|qy
Oh, yes, .|ny
Is it, uh, many other corporations in the area?|qy
Uh, I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring.|no
Well, I'm sure with the new, uh, aw-, contract awarding -|%
I, I think it went to Lockheed, didn't it?|qy
Yes.|ny
That, uh, I hear they're hiring all over the place for that.|sd
Yeah, uh,|aa
no,|ar
Apple's coming to town|sd
and,|sd
Oh, really?|bh
and, uh, and, -|%
Now is that ad good just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs?|qy
Colorado Springs specifically,|sd
yes.|ny
How about that.|bh
And, uh, and, uh, M C I -s coming if, if, telemarketing is your bag.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Personally I'd rather die a slow painful death|sd
but, -|%
Well, you in the, uh, computer operations or in the actual, uh, manufacturing?|qy
Uh, I'm a defense worker.|sd
I'm, government tool control specialist.|sd
Right,|b
yeah,|b
that's why I was in the Deseg down here in Plano also.|sd
Are you still employed?|qy
Am I still employed by T I,|qy
no,|nn
I took a leave of, of T I back in November.|sd
Oh.|b
Actually, December was my first month away from them.|sd
Exempt or ?|qy
Exempt.|sd
Oh, yes.|bk
It, uh, unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't, uh, it was purely by my own choice.|sd
It wasn't, uh, there was no incentive for myself to leave,|sd
but it was just an opportunity arose|sd
and decided to take it.|sd
Oh, so, you didn't even get the severance package.|qy^d
No.|nn
I should have taken the, the, the, you know, uh, option when that was there,|sd
but it was just, I missed it by a couple months.|sd
But, you know, what can one do.|qh
I'm just happy still to have a job.|sd
So, are you happy with what you are doing now?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I am kind of happy with it,|sd
it's getting better all the time,|sd
I knew it would be different from the very beginning,|sd
but, you know, as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system, -|sd
so I was in the computer operations|sd
it's, uh, you know, it all starts to become similar|sd
there's, you know, there's benefits|sd
and there's things that weren't as good,|sd
Yeah.|b
but as an overall package, I'd say I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out.|sd
Good,|ba
good.|ba
Well, it hasn't been a long time T I|sd
or I,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well, the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing|sv
and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the de-, the defense area but manufacturing in general. -|sv
To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm, I'm not really worried.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's great.|ba
That's good.|ba
And, and I seem rather happy about it most of the time,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Sure,|b
yeah.|b
Sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table.|ba
But still in all,|sd
It may be a blessing in disguise.|sv
I know a number of people who are, uh, surplused|sd
and they're just, -|%
actually, what the positions that they found outside of the company were much, much better than the ones that they currently had inside.|sv
So, despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains,|sd

Uh-huh,|b
well, I'm sure it's just with the, the, the, the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you dec-, decide on a pass , -|sv
Uh, situational.|%
I've, I doubt I'll be here in six months.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, would you like to be there?|qy
I, -|%
all things being equal, yes.|na
Uh-huh.|b
But, or, or even somewhere better,|sd
Sure.|ba
but, God this is much better than west Texas.|sv
Uh-huh|b
Well, just take the day, -|%
But then they, they tell me Hell is much better than west Texas.|sd
Well, actually, uh, the, the Plano, Dallas, Houston, you know, Austin that whole area is, is actually quite, quite nice.|sv
I, my little brother lives in Austin right now.|sd
Oh, that's a beautiful place.|sd
Goes to U T.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's just fantastic down there.|sd
Take it more as a, -|%
this is your opportunity to do whatever you want,|sv
pick out where you want to live,|ad
and then once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do.|ad
I see that's the problem.|sd
For the last many years I've more or less let them direct what I want to do,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Sure.|ba
And now I feel lost.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
that's a, -|%
it, it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it.|qy
Oh, I had job offers.|no
Uh-huh.|b
But, I never found the one that was worth it for me to leave.|sd
And that, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Well, the best thing about it is that you can, uh, try something|sv
if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else.|ad
That's the way I would have looked at the whole thing here,|sd
I'll take a chance,|sd
if I don't like it, I'll go someplace else, do something different.|sd
Oh so, had you been with T I long when you changed?|qy
Five years.|no
Yeah.|b
I've been with them sixteen.|sd
Yeah,|b
I can imagine, you know, the longer and longer it goes, -|sv
Actually, seventeen now,|sd

momentum is, uh, driving force in our lives.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But so, yeah,|%
I'm looking as, as a opportunity.|sd
Well, that's good,|ba
you've got a good attitude about it.|sv
And, and I'm looking at it as a change.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I'm looking at it as, as an adventure.|sd
Right,|ba
there you go.|ba
That's the way to do it.|ba
And maybe I'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if I don't get laid off between now and then.|sd
There you go,|ba
that's the thing to do.|ba
That's much funner than doing any kind of job.|ba
Ha, how about we end this?|qy
That will work out just fine.|no
Nice talking to you.|fc
All right,|fc
nice talking to you.|fc

Good-bye.|fc
All right|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
so, uh, you live in Dallas?|qy
Yes,|ny
I live in Dallas.|sd
Now I understand that, um, the, the real estate market out there has really gone crazy, up and down, up and down.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
I think right now it's, it's kind of bad Uh,|sv
I don't live in a house,|sd
I live in an apartment|sd
Oh.|%
Are, are you in a house?|qy
Yeah,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
Okay.|bk
Yeah,|b
we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I guess the best I can do is, is, uh, compare apartments|sd
If it can compare the one that I have now,|sd
Uh, this one, you know, gave us free cable and, uh, ceiling fans|sd
and, uh, it was practically new when I moved in here|sd
and the carpet was new|sd
and, -|%
Huh.|%
Do you live in the high-rise?|qy
No,|nn
it's not a high-rise.|sd
It's just a, a two story building.|sd
Uh-huh.|bk
Uh, but there's, you know, there, there are a lot of buildings|sd
but it's just two stories.|sd
Uh, on the second floor they have, they don't have a patio|sd
but they have a sunroom instead of the patio.|sd
On the first floor, um, where I am, there's a patio.|sd
Oh, okay.|b
So, so you just, you have one floor all to yourself?|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
Oh, okay.|bk
The rooms are nice and large|sd
and, let's see, I have, I have two bedrooms.|sd
And, uh, , -|%
Oh, that's nice.|ba
Do you get your own washer, dryer?|qy
Well, I, I, I have a washer and dryer area|no
and I, I did buy the washer and dryer,|sd
but they didn't provide it.|sd
Oh.|bk
The one that I moved from didn't, didn't have a place to put them,|sd
and that's one of the reasons that I did move.|sd
Yeah.|b
That is nice.|sv
Yeah.|b
Get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat|sv
Yeah.|aa
So, tell me ab-, -|ad
Yeah,|b
I've always, uh, been pretty lucky.|sd
The real estate out here's been pretty good.|sd
It, uh, the, the prices of, well, the prices came down last year.|sd
We've, we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome|sd
Yeah.|b
The past, uh, uh, year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It just ,|sv
It just never happened before.|sd
So it's really surprising everybody.|sd
All the developers don't know what to do|sd
Yeah,|b
it's a good time to buy,|sv
Yeah,|b
unfortunate-, -|%
we're, uh, we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we have a three bedroom house.|sd
And it's pretty much filled up right now.|sd
Oh, so you want a bigger one.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
Get an extra bedroom or a basement.|sd
Right now it's just a, a single level rambler.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
One thing about the houses in, uh, in Dallas, they don't, uh, utilize basements the way they did in New York.|sd
My parents in New York had, uh, a, uh, three family house.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Actual a, -|%
two family house where the, the, um, the downstairs and the second floor they had, -|sd
and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment, you know.|sd
Oh.|b
And, uh, they had a basement,|sd
and they, you know, they finished the basement,|sd
and they were able to rent that out also.|sd
But, uh, in Dallas I, I just, I just haven't seen basements in houses.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
And I've looked at a lot of them, you know .|sd
Yeah,|b
a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there,|sd
and that's what he said was that, you know, it just wasn't something that people had down there.|sd
No,|aa
it's a-, -|%
They put pools and garages on,|sd
Right.|b
I haven't, I haven't, I have yet to see a basement in a house.|sd
Huh.|%
And, uh, -|%
Maybe it's all the sand.|sv
Is there a lot of sand in, -|qy
I always think it's like a desert,|sd
I don't know.|h
Dallas always, -|%
Well, no.|ar
No,|ar
no,|ar
no,|ar
you know, I don't see that kind of sand here. Um,|sd
there are some areas though where, where they have a problem with, uh, the houses kind of sinking a little bit --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
or the foundation is sinking or something. You know, just a little, just a little bit, some more than others.|sd
But you, you have to know the right spot,|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh , -|%
Well, out here we, um, we live in what used to be, uh, like a prairie or whatever a natural, you know, natural grasslands.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, they, -|%
it's just, you go down four inches|sd
and you get to sands-, well, fourteen inches you get to sandstone.|sd
Yeah.|b
And so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast|sd
I see.|b
It's just solid sandstone.|sd
Huh.|%
Where did you say you're at, Colorado?|qy
No,|nn
Virginia.|sd
Virginia,|b^m
Virginia.|b
That's right .|sd
Yeah,|b
it's sort of unusual really.|sv
Most of Virginia is clay.|sd
Anywhere near, uh, Virginia Beach?|qy^d
Oh, yeah,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
Yeah.|ny
My, uh, my folks used to live there.|sd
Back before I was born,|sd
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well, different areas in Dallas have different kind, -|sd
in, uh, in Texas I'll say|sd
because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, in the, in the Dallas, you know, Fort Worth city areas you don't see that.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, uh, Texas is a big state|sd
so I imagine the, the type of houses and, uh, things like that are truly different from area to area|sv
Yeah,|b
well, -|%
But, uh, that's the same way out here|sd
because, um, well, we, for example, and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and anything instead that beltway, the highway, the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, you know, you really can't afford, I, I, I could never afford a house inside the beltway.|sd
That's why we came out here.|sd
This is called the, the, the country, you know, with only, you know, maybe twenty miles total from D C, twenty-five --|sd
Huh.|%
But, um, it's considered the country since it's, uh, you know, that far out.|sd
Well , -|%
But, um, yeah,|b
we live out by Dulles Airport.|sd
I see.|b
Yeah,|b
and, uh, that's one of the few places still in northern Virginia|sd
they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here|sd
and, you know, it's, it's still pretty rural.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore.|sv
Land has gotten so expensive|sd
they just can't afford to have low income housing like that.|sv
So, is your house in an area by itself?|qy
I mean, -|%
No,|nn
we're in a development.|sd
it's not connected to another one?|qy^d
There's, uh, -|%
yeah,|ny
there's another one half an acre away,|sd
Oh.|%
But it's not, they're not connected are they?|qy
Oh, no.|nn
Huh-uh.|nn
You have to, uh, stay in one single family home.|sd
I sort of got spoiled with that when I was growing up.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, my folks, um, had an apartment for a while when we were kids|sd
but, um, for the most part i-, they, they always had, you know, -|sd
and Pennsylvania always had a single family home|sd
and so,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and that's all I ever knew growing up,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so. I stayed in a townhouse for, uh, two years and then, uh, saved up enough money to, to get a, -|sd
Hello.|fp
Hello|fp
Hi, um,|fp
this is Betty|fp
and I'm in Richardson, Texas.|sd
I'm Nola|fp
and I'm in Plano.|sd
Oh, okay,|b
well here we go|sd
I guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are, that did some stuff over in the Gulf. Um.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
now, did you push one?|qy
Yeah, uh,|ny
Oh, okay.|bk
no|nn
I haven't pushed one yet.|sd
I just, -|%
Okay,|b
but, I think it's, -|sd
I just started doing this|sd
so I don't know too much about it.|sd
Okay,|b
we're just sort of getting acquainted here.|sd
Oh, okay.|b
Um, you know, I, I just wanted to see if, you know, you had an opinion about this,|sd
or, you know. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Um, so, if that's okay with you, then I'll just press one.|oo_co_cc
That will be fine.|aa
Okay|b
Well, hi,|fp
Hi.|fp
Good morning. Um,|fp
I think I mean, if, if I start this I just wanted to say that, um, one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the, the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are,|sv
and I mean they think differently|sv
and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours.|sv
And, and right now, I, I think that that's been proven in the fact that, um, they have just, -|sv
well, anyway, I just think that, you know, the United States policy over there, -|sv
I think we should just leave them alone.|sv
I really do. In, in a major way because they just, um, that whole region over there, I think needs to settle its own differences within itself.|sv
Yeah.|b
And that's the way, the course that they should go,|sv
I mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them,|sv
but I don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on.|sv
The, the thing with Israel and Palestine, I believe that should be settled between them.|sv
And also, um, you know, the other thing is their idea, or our ide-, idea of democracy has nothing to do with them.|sv
I mean, tha-, I mean, I'm talking about the whole middle ea-,|sd
and, and maybe this is too general,|h
but I just believe that, um, they do not look at democracy the same way we do.|sv
They don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live.|sv
Yeah.|b
And, so, you know, trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just, you know, -|sv
i-, I don't think that that's the way to go in this|sv
and, um, you know, it, it. Oh, well, that's, that's a couple thoughts on it.|h
Yeah.|b
I, I guess, you know, I'd like you to maybe express something here.|ad
Well I, I, I think overall that's right.|aap_am
I think it's kind of sad though, that, for generations they've been taught to hate each other.|sv
Yeah.|b
And that's, i-, you know, -|%
if, -|%
somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way.|sv
That's, -|%
yeah.|b
You know, an, an, I, I think that, um, -|sv
true we do have completely different ways of looking at things, at a lot of things,|sv
but, uh, at the same time, I think there are a lot of, there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do, as far as example|sv
and, and, uh, I think some different things could come from what's happened, than what we expect.|sv
Well, ye-,|%
well, yeah,|b
um, I, I guess we could be a catalyst for their change.|sv
I, um, -|%
the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there|sv
and I don't think we'd be talking about this, you know, the Israeli situation, Palestinian situation, um, sort of came to a head, um, unless there had been a war.|sv
I mean that was one thing,|sd
Yeah.|b
I, I don't judge any war as good or bad,|sd
it's just a war.|sv
Yeah.|b
And I don't see any winners or losers,|sv
I just see dead bodies.|sv
I'm sorry. You know,|sv
but, um, i-, I, I just think, you know, you're right|sv
and I think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along.|sv
It's not going to be that we're going to, uh, you know, sort of, tell them to go to their room|sv
and that's going to solve the whole problem.|sv
Yeah.|b
It's going to be them,|sv
But, that's the type of thing they understand.|sv
Yeah.|b
They don't understand any other way.|sv
And, you know, -|%
And so at that, at that, you have to work at their level,|sv
It's, -|%
Yeah,|aa
that, that's true too,|sv
I, um. -|%
They wouldn't have understood anything else than what we did in the war.|sv
Oh, well yeah,|b
they, they understand violence.|sv
There was nothing else.|sv
Yeah.|%
They love violent leaders, to, you know,|sv
I mean look at, you know, the leader they had.|ad
They, they just adored him,|sv
Yeah.|b
and, you know, for a while there he had them, be-, -|sd
I can't figure out why they adored him.|sd
Well it has a lot to do with their religion.|sv
I got to say,|sd
Yes,|b
yeah.|b
and I know this only because from personal experience that I'm speaking of this,|sd
because I, I've, you know, traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where I've done that|sd
and one, one of the kindest people I've ever met in my whole life, um, is from that area of the country|sd
and I mean he is just overly, he, he is abounding in kindness, let's say.|sd
Yeah.|b
And his wife is so godly, I mean, every thought,|sd
they have a totally different life than we have.|sv
Huh.|%
You know, and when you add the, um, commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them.|sv
Yeah.|b
And they have very basic life, um,|sd
well it's just a very basic life|sd
and they just really believe in Allah, or God, or whatever.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it's, you know, everything is to the glory of Allah,|sv
and, and, you know, and, it, it's almost like, -|sv
What's sad is that the leaders that have control --|sv
Yeah,|b
well that's,|%
yeah.|b
yes,|b
and they abuse that.|sv
And it's always been military|sd
and it's always been,|sd
and that's, that's always been the way of the world. Don't you think|qy
Which I think that that's not the, the way the majority of the people over there really are.|sv
Yeah.|b
So it's really hard, when you see the leaders, compared to the people.|sv
But I think in a, in a way the war, uh, I think in a way all, the involvement over there too, though, has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing.|sv
And there are a lot of people who are good people.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
You know, there's, -|%
and I, I think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these, uh, newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the, the, uh, soldiers leaving, um, you know, surrendering and,|sv
Right|aa
and surrendering,|sd
that was, -|%
Yeah.|b
And, and, the, you know, -|%
it just really comes down to people are people, you know,|sv
you have to have some compassion some humanness.|sv
That's right.|aa
Doesn't matter where the boundaries are. Um, you know,|sv
there are political boundaries|sd
and those are man made boundaries,|sd
but, you know, for heaven sakes, that's something that's been going on for ages,|sd
and I, I think so much of it is what you're taught.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
You know, they teach their children, uh, in such a way that, -|sv
Well, hi.|fp
I guess, uh, I'll just start by saying that we entertain with, uh, a gourmet club here. Um, which means that we have like eight, eight people, four couples.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And most of the husbands, -|sd
this is really peculiar,|sv
most of the husbands cook.|sd
Great.|ba
I mean, the wives during the day, you know, get, I guess, so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day.|sv
Um, you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff,|sd
but it was the guys that got together and did all this.|sd
Oh, that's nice.|ba
And, um, like my husband just, he really, really likes to cook in terms of, um, oh, barbecue,|sd
and I mean all guys, I think, like to barbecue.|sv
I think it's caveman,|sv
Right,|b
right.|b
I'm telling you,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
but, um, he really does cook|sd
and it's a good thing because, you know, you can't, you can't knock that.|sv
No.|aa
But all these other guys do too,|sd
and so we've gotten together|sd
and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals.|sd
And it's really, really kind of a neat thing to do.|sv
You, -|%
How often do you meet?|qw
Well, we try,|%
I mean, because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that.|^h
It's like, you know, if we can do it once every six months, we're doing well|sd
Oh, yes,|b
yes.|b
Yeah.|b
So, I mean we originally started out, you know, when we were younger --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
then we would, we tried to do it every other month,|sd
Yeah.|b
but lately it's just been once every six months|sd
Oh.|b
Well, that's much more reasonable.|sv
I was involved in a, a club like that for, um, that, you know, where we tried to really do gourmet, uh, meals.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, we, we were a little bit too frequent I think.|sv
Oh.|b
I don't remember if we were once a month|sd
or anyway it was, it was difficult.|sv
By the time we went around it was, uh, four couples|sd
so, uh, by the time we got around, uh, to each of us and it was time again, we were almost tired, you know.|sd
Really,|b
really|b
It's too rich.|sv
Oh, it is absolutely.|aa
And, so, i-, we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day.|sd
Yeah|b
Um, so, uh, we, we kind of, -|%
and then one of the couples, uh, moved|sd
and so we sort of didn't, didn't continue it,|sd
but, um, and I must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time, then you, you don't have as much time for, uh, regular entertaining,|sd
but, um, uh, uh, when, when we entertain I usually try to find something that will be, um, kind of h-, good for everybody|sd
and that's,|sd
Right.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
Well, yeah,|aa
that's true.|sv
And we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish|sd
so I mean he can get within, -|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
well, one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all.|sd
Oh, my.|ba
Uh, so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Uh, well, I take that back.|sd
Uh, she can't eat some cream cheese.|sd
But that, that really limits,|sv
It sure d-, -|aa
um,|%
it makes you, uh, keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out,|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Right.|b
Right.|b^m
So we, we try to keep all that in mind,|sd
but otherwise, um, I guess, you know, entertaining, um, -|%
I, I guess I have recipes|sd
I, um, -|%
but that's, that's basically what we do is the gourmet,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so, you know, they would be pretty elaborate.|sd
Yeah.|b
Um, but it's fun.|sv
I mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff,|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
and,|sd
Yeah.|b
but you're right.|sv
It's very, very rich|sv
and I'm glad we don't have it every, -|sd
because it is, it's a, quite a treat|sv
it really is.|sv
Yeah.|b
Um,|%
Sounds wonderful.|ba
Right,|b
but so, you like food|qy^d
and I just love the, the community of food.|sd
I just,|sv
Oh, sure I do too.|aa
Yeah.|b
I just love sharing meals and,|sd
Right.|b
I don't think you have to be, you know, more than hamburgers and hot dogs out,|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
But, but, -|%
Sure.|b
Well, my, um, daughter is graduating, uh, Sunday|sd
and so we're having,|sd
Oh.|b
And I did a cop out on to it|sd
I'm buying cold cuts|sd
Well, I have to,|sd
What are you providing ?|qw
and I have to make hors d'oeuvres|sd
and I have to make dessert|sd
so,|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
There you go.|ba
Uh, so, oh, I'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on.|sd
But I can't do it, you know, working full-time|sd
and, it's just too much.|sv
I know.|ba
We're all not built like, uh, what, what, oh,|sd
Those people that try to do everything.|^2
Yeah|b
We all aren't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and,|sd
Ugh|ba
Wouldn't that be nice?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Shot a video of the whole thing,|sd
I don't know .|h
Yeah,|aa
right.|aa
But it's, it's really kind of a neat thing.|sv
I get a kick out of it.|sd
I, I really do.|sd
Everything, all parts of the food,|sd
I mean --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
and, and you know people really pretty much appreciate it.|sv
Oh, they do.|ba
I-, it's very difficult to purchase, um, items that are as good as what you can make yourself.|sv
Oh, I think so.|aa
Um, in spite of, uh, -|%
or if you, if you do buy it, it's extremely expensive.|sv
In fact, uh, I just got back from a shopping trip to purch-, purchase the cold cuts|sd
and I, I bought turkey and pastrami and, and barbecued ham at a, an Amish market near here.|sd
Oh.|b
And I've never been there before.|sd
Oh.|b
and the foods are wonderful.|sd
And one of the, uh, the, um, vendors had cakes. All sorts of wonderful cakes. Uh, they, fresh str-, strawberry cheesecake now and, and so on.|sd
Oh.|b
And it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake. Um, which is really not such a bad price.|sd
I decided I, I just couldn't quite make myself, um, buy it because I do make cheesecake|sd
and somehow --|sd
There you go.|ba
but I was very tempted because it looked wonderful,|sd
and the-, they had black forest cherry cake and all those things.|sd
Oh.|b
That ar-, but those are homemade.|sd
They are not, um, commercial bakery made.|sd
And in that they are made in their homes, um,|sd
so it, it's kind of interesting, uh,|sv
it's out there if you want to pay the price|sd
but, -|%
Oh, it is.|aa
I mean, we have bakeries around here that, you know, you, you just gain weight going by the door,|sd
Right,|b
just smelling the air|bf
Yeah.|%
Right,|aa
but I don't know|h
I guess some of the best things I've ever had, um, I, some of them were just hors d'oeuvres, you know.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Doing little hors d'oeuvre things that, I have a kick making that, I mean, you know|sd
Yeah.|b
I get off on strange little details of food, I guess.|sd
But --|sd
Yeah.|b
this is the southwest,|sd
this is,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know you can always make it hotter,|sd
Right.|b
so. That's, um, a really good party time,|sv
Yeah.|b
and, and they just love it, you know, down here.|sv
It just --|%
We like hot food too,|sd
so. -|%
all the stuff that goes with that,|sd
so. -|%
Right.|b
You don't sound like you're from Texas originally though.|qy^d
Oh, I'm not.|ng
Thank you for noticing|ft
I'm from Chicago.|sd
I thought,|sd
And how I got, -|%
Really|b
and how,|sd
Right.|b
But, -|%
I'll bet.|ba
Yeah.|b
Did, um, do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy|qy
or is it always complicat-,|qrr
Well, absolutely.|na
I, -|%
in fact, it just came to mind, um,|sd
and this, -|%
What was one of the latest ones that you've seen, actually?|qw
Oh, I gue-, I think we rented PRETTY WOMAN --|sd
Uh.|b
Right.|b
The last two years, I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home.|sd
I've, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so I said "hey, it's worth it,|sd
I'll just go at the matinee hour|^q
and I can see what I please."|^q
Yeah.|b
It's no more costly than renting one.|sd
The last, -|%
see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw F X TWO|sd
and that is a really good movie, if you like special effects,|sv
kind of gory and lots of, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I have not done that one,|sd
I don't know if I have even heard of that one.|sd
Um, do you know that I don't follow performers,|sd
Oh.|b
I don't follow actors.|sd
Some I know,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
some I don't.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, and he was -|%
the guy, the guy that played in it, he was not the star, but the one that played in it that I liked best was the one who was in, uh, oh, the one about the old people.|sd
COCOON?|qy^d
COCOON,|sd
uh-huh.|ny
Okay.|b
He was a blond haired, heavyset alien in COCOON.|sd
Oh, okay.|b
I don't, I don't know what his name is.|sd
Uh, I think I know who you are talking about though.|sd
Yeah.|b
At any rate, I also saw not long ago ONCE AROUND.|sd
That was with Richard Dreyfuss.|sd
Okay.|b
And, that one was just a very poignant story,|sv
it, it, it had people,|sd
it was, it was you know, a lot of people said it was a really funny movie,|sd
but it was,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and there was, it was like, uh, uh, STEEL MAGNOLIAS.|sv
The characters played very well off one another.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And there was humor involved,|sd
but the story was a very dramatic story,|sv
and I enjoyed it very much.|sd
What are some others that you have seen lately?|qw
Oh, I'm trying to think, uh,|^h
just the other night on H B O we watched THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,|sd
Oh, whoa,|ba
yes.|b
and that's one that, -|%
That's one I can watch,|sd
Yeah.|aa
I was going to read while it was on,|sd
but then when it started, I just couldn't, you know, read.|sd
That was a really good movie.|sv
It sure was.|aa
And, you know, the second time you see it, you understand more subtleties in it.|sv
There are a number of good movies like that.|sv
Yeah,|b
there's quite a few, uh, movies out now that I would like to go see.|sd
My husband,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and I guess, more than anything, that is why we don't go.|sd
Yeah.|b
Plus, by the time you get a baby-sitter, and then pay to go to the movies --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
You don't work?|qy^d
No,|nn
I stay at home.|sd
Okay.|bk
Well, you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day.|ad
Yeah.|b
Go during the day,|bf
that's right.|aa
That's right.|sd
There's nothing wrong with that.|sv
Go in the early hours,|ad
it's a matinee,|sd
it's not crowded|sd
and the price is as reasonable as renting a video.|sv
Yeah.|b
And that's the way I do it|sd
and I go quite frequently.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
If you are going to be planning on doing that, -|sd
now I was WARLOCK too, which is supposed to be the story of a, uh, witch hunt that is, you know, magically shot into the present time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was, I was very well persuaded to walk out. Very well persuaded,|sd
there was more gore than I was interested in seeing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, as the movie settles down to a comfortable action, uh, I can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either.|sd
But,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, of course, I enjoyed those good guy, bad guy type conflicts things.|sd
So, I enjoyed that movie, after the first few minutes of gore.|sd
And there were some others,|sd
but they were done a little more tastefully.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, uh, in the first scene, the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then --|sd
Uh.|b
and I could not handle that.|sd
I said "whoa, I'm glad I have not had dinner".|sd
Then, uh, I saw AWAKENING,|sd
that's a wonderful, wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro.|sv
I, uh, I, uh, -|%
Robert De Niro?|br
Robert De Niro,|sd
what did I say, Peter?|qw
I think you said Peter.|sd
I said Robert De Niro.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, he has done a really good job of characterizing the, uh, disabled person.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, of course, Robin Williams always just has a, an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing.|sv
Even when he's sad, you know, you great faith that he will get happy again.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And then, oh, let's see, there's a couple or three that I would like to go see before they go into videos.|sd
I guess, I can wait another month|sd
and they will be videos.|sd
Yeah|b
One is SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.|sd
I've heard a lot about that one.|sd
They say if you really want to be, uh, you really want some suspense, that's the one to see.|sd
And, I understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television. Uh.|sd
Well, you know, I think I read about that too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then THELMA AND LOUISE,|sd
I think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie.|sv
It's about time for one of those.|sv
I want to go see that.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I'm going to try to get in DANCES WITH WOLVES.|sd
Oh, you haven't, -|qy^d
I've heard that is wonderful.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
I've heard it's wonderful too,|sd
but I, it's just that they are both very long --|sd
Yeah.|b
and the matinee starts before I can get away from work.|sd
Oh.|b
And, after, after that I get involved in other things and don't want to --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I've heard that's, -|sd
we, uh, we, uh, rented the other one,|sd
I was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately, uh, was PRESUMED INNOCENT, with, uh, Harrison Ford,|sd
I guess he's in there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, I thought that was really good.|sv
You know, I saw that|sd
and I really I cannot remember too much about it.|sd
It was the one where he was a defense, -|sd
uh, not defense,|ar
he was a prosecu-, -cuter.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And there was a murder of one of the women that was in the, the D A -'s office.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then he ended up being accused of it.|sd
Oh, that's right,|aa
I remember now.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I remember.|sd
Yeah,|b
so, I mean it really kind of had a turn at the end, when you found out who it was|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies.|sd
I think he ought to stay Indiana Jones.|sv
I realize that he would like his career to develop,|sd
but I don't want to see him in other things.|sd
But, uh, I tell you, Sean Connery in the HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,|sd
I, I never did care for him as, in the James Bond movies.|sd
I don't know|h
he was too . -|%
I was never into those movies, either.|aa
Yeah,|b
I didn't care for the type of movie,|sd
but he was always slick, and greasy, and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed|sv
and I didn't like him.|sd
But, he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older.|sv
Yeah,|b
I thought he looked real good with a beard, too.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
he does|sv
and there is just a, there's a, -|%
I don't know, uh,|h
I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning, whether he is or not.|sv
Yeah.|b
And he, he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time.|sv
And, I enjoy those,|sd
and I enjoy some of the Michael J. Fox movies.|sd
I didn't care too much for the last one either.|sd
It just was not enough to it.|sv
What was the last one?|qw
I'm trying to think.|sd
Uh.|%
Uh, the last, -|%
like, BACK TO THE FUTURE then was the last one .|sd
No,|ar
no,|ar
no,|ar
it was called, uh, HARD WAY, where he was an actor, trying to portray --|sd
Oh, okay,|b
And that, -|%
Hi Ed.|fp
Hi.|fp
Hi.|fp
Uh, books,|sd
I've, actually I am reading a couple of different books, uh,|sd
one wa-, is, uh, a story,|sd
well it is not a story,|sd
it is a collection of, uh, of memos, supposedly written by Howard Hughes, uh,|sd
Oh.|%
that was, uh, that was, -|%
it came out a couple of years ago|sd
and I have just now gotten around to reading it.|sd
I have had it a couple years,|sd
but, uh, jus-, jus-, -|%
Who wrote that?|qw
Oh, I do not remember the man's name,|sd
he was, used to be a reporter for, uh, I think, the NEW YORK TIMES, or the WASHINGTON POST, one of the two,|sd
and he supposedly got this, this, s-, story, uh, I mean this, uh, was contacted by this guy who had these, these memos he wanted to sell,|sd
and they were, they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the, uh, corporate headquarters in, uh, in Los Angeles.|sd
Huh.|b
They, on -|%
I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something, there in Los Angeles,|sd
they used to have a, -|sd
or, I guess they still do, uh,|sv
had a, uh, uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which had offices|sd
and it was sort of nondescript for a, uh, you know, for the size of the company which, inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected,|sd
he, he was, uh, a great collector of everything,|sd
he, he, he did not, he did not throw anything away|sd
and, uh, supposedly this guy had, had been breaking there for awhi-,|sd
he was a, like, you know, burglar, had been breaking there awhile and, uh,|sd
I see.|b
he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect,|sd
and they, uh, they broke in one, one night and found a bunch of memos that were, uh, supposedly from, from Hughes to, uh, to his main, uh, main a-, assistant back, uh, in the fifties and si-, well, I guess, in the sixties,|sd
Well, that is interesting.|ba
Right.|b
So, it's pretty interesting work|sv
so, -|%
That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.|sv
Yeah,|b
it's a, it's a little, it's a little hard|sv
you have to plod through it|sv
and, you know, it does not have a real story, or any plot,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on.|sd
And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.|sd
No,|aa
I have not seen it.|sd
But it's, but it is, it is real interesting,|sv
Yeah.|b
uh, I also reading, uh, the, uh, thi-, -|sd
it's a, an old, another old book that I happen to have.|sd
I am sort of rereading it.|sd
It's, uh, a book about, uh, the Bermuda Triangle,|sd
but it's, uh, it's about, it's a real good book that a guy, uh, wrote who was, uh, a research librarian,|sd
he wrote, uh, sort of debunking many of the, uh, uh, the stories about the, uh, Bermuda Triangle. You know,|sd
he, he was thinking many,|sd
Uh.|%
Explained , *listen; could be br|sd
and, you know. Uh, and the rea-, reason I was, picked it back up was in light of all the, uh, Well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the Atlantic, thinking they were Flight Nineteen.|sd
And I don't know if you are familiar with that at all|sd
but it's, uh, -|%
Flight Nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two. Right after World War Two,|sd
and they were, they were lost|sd
and, uh, -|%
Supposedly scooped up by the triangle.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
they were.|sd
Yeah.|b
And so, and in the book, you know, even, -|sd
he wrote this book back in the seventies,|sd
and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water.|sd
And, uh, because he, he mentions, he, he goes through and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth.|sd
And, uh, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking, now that, they just got turned around and could not find their way back.|sv
Yeah.|b
On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her?|qy
Uh, no,|nn
I have not.|sd
I, I think that would be, -|sv
I am sure there is something out there, uh, ,|sv
Yeah,|b
I would I would like to, too,|sd
because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her, you know, possibilities of he-, of where she , -|sd
I thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years.|sd
Uh|%
Well whatever, this is one aspect of it.|sd
Yeah.|b
Of course, you know, it is so weird,|sv
cause no one will ever really know,|sv
it's, it, tha-, -|%
so but it's entertaining|sv
and it makes you think about things.|sv
Right.|b
That is for sure.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, that is pretty much for right now,|sd
that is,|sd
Yeah.|b
I kind of like to read different stuff|sd
and, uh, I like to read a novel every now and then,|sd
but, uh, I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time.|sd
Right.|b
Well, I, I guess I just have not read anyth-, -|sd
I mean, usually, I just, if I find a good book, I will sit, you know, for two days until it is finished. If it's that good,|sd
Yeah.|b
and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow's|sd
and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT.|sd
Yes.|b
And I just really, really liked the way he writes.|sd
It's just,|sv
Yeah,|b
I read that, too.|sd
I got it, uh, right,|sd
My, uh, you know, -|%
Yeah.|b
he was an, an assistant district attorney in Chicago at, uh, and while he was writing the book,|sd
and, uh, my sister-in-law lives in Chicago,|sd
and she had, before it actually got big, she sent me this book saying, you might like this,|sd
this guy is, you know,|^q
Uh.|b
And, uh, I read it and really liked it|sd
and then about, -|%
that is when it really got big.|sd
And, uh, so I, -|%
That was good, I think.|sv
And, and the other book I am trying to think, you know, like was in the last year|sd
and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY, uh,|sd
OF THE VANITY ,|^2
BON|%
yeah.|aa
I have not read that, although,|sd
Uh.|%
Yeah|b
I, -|%
that was really, really good,|sv
the movie was nothing compared to the book.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that is what I have heard.|sd
And. -|%
Yeah.|b
I saw the movie,|sd
and, uh, -|%
Oh, the movie was a joke compared to, -|sv
I mean, because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive,|sv
Yeah.|b
Right.|b
and,|sv
Right.|b
I know.|b
And, anyway, we are not talking about that,|sd
but, uh, gee, I just I like to read gardening books and things like that. Just to tell me what to do with my garden|sd
and, uh,|%
Yeah.|b
I have a lot of, uh, uh, computer books that -|sd
I am, I do computer work|sd
and so I have a lot of those.|sd
So, I spend a lot of time looking through those, not necessarily reading them but,|sd
Yeah.|b
But I, I'm interested in a lot of that,|sd
but, uh, I have got a lot of books that I, I intend to read,|sd
but I have not been able to yet, you know, for one reason or another.|sd
Like, what is a book on your list,|qw
you know I have a list too|sd
and I have never gotten to it|sd
Oh, gosh, I do not, I do not really have a list,|sd
cause I just kind of, uh, I just have all the books out, you know,|sd
I have book shelves|sd
and I have them all out|sd
and usually when I am through with one, I will go in and, uh, uh, uh, look, look through, uh,|sd
I have one now and I, I can not remember the name of it that I, that I got is -|sd
the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or, or Christmas or something will send me another, another good book|sd
and, uh,|%
Oh.|b
I have one|sd
and I can not remember the name of it, uh,|sd
it is supposed to be a mystery.|sd
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Okay,|b^m
where have you all been on vacation recently?|qw
Recently,|sd
my most recent trip was last year,|sd
and that was Detroit.|sd
Detroit?|br
Yeah.|ny
Is that a nice vacation spot?|qy
Well, it wasn't really.|ng
It was, um, uh, to see an old relative.|sd
Right,|bk
okay.|bk
And it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.|sd
Right.|b
So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?|qy^d
No.|nn
The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico.|sd
Ooh, that would be nice.|ba
And that was real nice. Uh,|sv
Did you scuba dive there?|qy
No,|nn
we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.|sd
Ooh, that would be nice.|ba
Yeah,|b
and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit,|sd
Oh, that would be enjoyable.|ba
Right,|b
yeah,|b
that's,|ba
Huh.|b
I haven't been on vacation in a while either.|sd
Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.|ba
So it's a lot of fun.|sd
I worked up there last summer,|sd
so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the,|sd
Oh, well, that's nice.|ba
Yeah.|b
Worked at a camp there,|sd
and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains.|sd
So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.|sd
Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity,|sd
and that's canoeing.|sd
Oh.|b
And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River,|sd
and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado,|sd
and they've really enjoyed it.|sd
That's nice.|ba
We, um,|sd
It's a whole new, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.|sd
Huh.|%
It's really, really pretty.|sv
I was a little kid then,|sd
and we to have, uh, -|%
we stayed at some park|sd
and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night,|sd
and he would give a little talk about mountain things.|sd
You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man,|sd
but we were pretty convinced he was a full,|sd
Sure.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and we would have to, we'd -|sd
and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found|sd
and,|sv
Oh, that's neat.|ba
Sure.|b
and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening,|sv
but it wasn't,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It was like, -|sv
Well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too,|sv
and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,|sv
That's true.|aa
and I think they really it really pen-, penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.|sv
Yeah.|b
And you're more receptive.|sv
Well, that's good.|ba
Well, we, um, let's see, -|^h
the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then I went to England --|sd
Oh, that's exciting.|ba
I was a,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place|sd
and it's, there's not a language barrier|sd
so you don't, -|%
I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean,|sd
and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents,|sv
but it's, it was really fun.|sv
I, I, I really enjoyed that.|sd
I'm probably going back there to work,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now,|sd
but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England,|sd
because she really has a great desire to do that,|sd
because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it. -|sd
It, it's really nice.|sv
I would, I would spend all my time in London,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and that's it was really different being in a big city,|sd
because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
-- and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are|sd
and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate,|sd
but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
You could just kind of|sd
Do your own thing.|^2
Yeah.|b
I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I had a great time doing that.|sd
It was really interesting.|sv
That's wonderful.|ba
There's a lot out there to see,|sv
Yeah,|b
I know,|ba
I'll say .|ba
I keep wanting to get up to, -|sd
I haven't, I haven't been anywhere else outside the United States.|sd
I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or, -|sd
Well, I lived across the street almost from Canada|sd
Oh.|b
So that was, that, that's a nice place.|sv
Canada is very nice.|sv
Yeah,|b
that would be nice.|sv
I had a friend from there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia,|sd
but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to --|sd
Oh, yes,|aa
absolutely.|aa
Sure,|b
somebody that knows their way around.|bf
So, yeah,|aa
that's why, that's why England was nice.|sd
Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week,|sd
and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the, -|sd
most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and, -|sd
Well, you've been quite a few places there|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
we have.|sd
We .|sd
Once you think about it, huh.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day,|sd
and you slept on the train at night.|sd
Oh, that's great.|ba
But there wasn't a, -|%
it was strange,|sv
it was kind of sad,|sv
there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English|sd
and everyone in Switzerland,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's great.|ba
So we were kind of pitiful.|sd
We found one restaurant we were in and got seated,|sd
and then no one knew English in there,|sd
and we were just|sd
Uh-huh|b
But it was, -|%
What did you wind up with?|qw
Oh, I had fondue.|sd
That was easy to say|sd
Oh, okay|bk
Tried to get fondue and white wine,|sd
and that was, -|%
Uh, uh-huh.|b
we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly.|sd
There were some people at the next table who spoke English,|sd
so we|sd
They kind of guided you.|bf
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so,|sd
Well, good.|ba
I'd, I'd love to go back there.|sd
There's just not time|sd
There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.|sv
I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams.|sv
Right.|b
That's -|%
Yeah.|b
I guess that's what retirement is all about.|sv
That and sleeping late|sv
Yes.|b
I keep hoping for.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well --|fc
I understand that.|sd
Well, it was nice talking with you too, Craig.|fc
And have a good afternoon.|fc
You do the same.|fc
Okay.|fc
Thank you.|ft
Good-bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Um, tell me some about your camping experiences, Carolyn.|ad
Well, um, I have gone to girl's camp a few times, as a, you know, a chaperon or a leader, whatever --|sd
Okay.|bk
-- and, uh, I enjoy camping.|sd
I, -|%
we ha-, we have a tent,|sd
and we've gone, even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove, um,|sd
I guess our, our, my biggest memory is when we froze to death|sd
We just didn't take enough blankets and --|sd
Wh-, --|qw
Uh, we went camping at, uh, Lake Bonham, which is, is pretty close here. Um,|sd
we went fairly early in the season for this area, which is probably April --|sd
Okay.|bk
and, and it got really cold at night,|sd
and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things --|sd
Sure.|b
but, -|%
Uh, what, uh, what activities do you do when you're camping?|qw
Oh, we take little nature hikes|sd
and, and, uh, we take along games that we can play with the, with the kids, and just that kind of stuff.|sd
Usually try to have a, uh, occasionally a camp fire at night, you know, and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, that sounds like fun.|sv
I, uh, I grew up in South Dakota, up in the Black Hills --|sd
Oh.|b
-- and so we used to go camping,|sd
my dad would take us,|sd
there was, there was four of us kids,|sd
we'd, he'd take us,|sd
and we'd all go camping, my dad and my mom and, and the kids,|sd
and it was always fun, uh,|sd
because what I always remember is, my dad would let us pick our camp spot|sd
and, uh, he'd always tell us, you know, okay, look for, you know, a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents,|sd
and it always had to be somewhere near a, a river so we could go fishing,|sd
and hopefully we'd catch our supper,|sd
but we never did --|sd
Um.|%
-- but it was, it was always fun.|sd
We'd always, -|sd
Mom was always prepared|sd
and she'd bring along, you know, something, because tradition had it we would never catch anything,|sd
so we always had,|sd
but then we'd roast, roast marshmallows,|sd
and it, it was always an enjoyable experience.|sd
Uh, about nineteen eighty-two I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills,|sd
I crossed the state to, to Aberdeen,|sd
and, uh, there's no hills,|sd
it's flat,|sd
and then I was in high school,|sd
and, uh, couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and I, we'd go camping out by a river, of course, and, and go fishing,|sd
but by then, of course, I was able to catch, uh, catch some things,|sd
but, it, it was always fun.|sd
It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- you know, in the hills we, we would do like you di-, you folks did, you folks did, would take the nature hikes and, you know, and look for animals,|sd
and we always, you know, -|sd
in the hills, you can see quite a few different animals,|sd
but, -|%
Uh,|%
Go ahead.|ad
We used to live in Utah --|sd
Okay.|b
-- and, uh, of course, there's lots of mountains around there to camp in, and, and streams and stuff.|sd
That's, that's a great place to go camping,|sv
and the hiking is just really great.|sv
You know, hike up those mountains --|sv
Sure.|b
Now is there anything, uh, are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area.|qy
I'm not acquainted with any, you know,|ng
I, -|%
there's woods and things out in East Texas --|sd
Okay.|bk
there's a Tyler State Park that's, uh, really a nice camping area,|sv
but it, it's just a lot of trees,|sd
it's not, -|%
I don't know of any place in Texas that has, uh, really big, you know, what I call mountains|sd

The Rocky Mountains are so much, uh,|sv
Right.|b
Is the one in Tyler, has it been pretty commercialized, I suppose?|qy
No,|nn
it's not, well, it's not too bad.|sd
They have, um, screened in areas, you know,|sd
they're not really cabins, I wouldn't say,|sd
I guess they could call them that, but they're, they're more just a screened in, uh, camping area --|sd
Okay.|bk
they're, they're not bad.|sv
Helps, helps keep the, the pests out, I suppose.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
yeah|ny
Well, that sounds, -|%
I don't know if I can rate camping,|h
but, you know, it sure beats driving a thousand miles, to to find a mountain, I guess.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's right.|sv
I, I take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area.|qy^d
No,|nn
we just moved down in, in June.|sd

Yeah,|ny
I'm still trying to find my way around.|sd
I, if I --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
well, really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring, and, in, in the fall.|sv
Okay.|b
It just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly, -|sd

Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
What type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day?|qw
Um, huh. Well, I don't like it when, uh, people listen to my phone conversations, like if they're outside my door while I'm talking in my room|sd
Yeah,|b
that's right.|sv
That is really an invasion of privacy.|sv
Yeah.|b
I, I find it very annoying when I've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly, the solicitors, and the carpet cleaning companies and, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Does that happen in your part of the country?|qy
Yes.|ny

Some evenings are worse than others,|sv

Oh, goodness.|ba

mostly.|sd
Yeah|b
Now what can you do to stop that?|qw
Oh, I don't know.|sd
Well, I am used to it now,|sd
but sometimes it sort of gets, gets to me|sd
but there is not much I can really do.|sv
No.|aa
No.|b^m
Just have to live with it, I guess.|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
Try to remember to respect their privacy,|ad
and maybe they will respect yours|sv

Well, I don't know|h
I always, -|%
Do you have brothers?|qy
Uh, no,|nn
yes,|ny
I do,|sd
but they don't live at home.|sd
Oh, okay,|bk
I was ra-, -|%
I had two younger brothers,|sd
and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations|sd
and, -|%
Oh, I used to do that though because I was the youngest,|sd
I would pick up the phone and listen to theirs|sd
But I, -|%
I would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me,|sd
and then they would go get on the other extension --|sd
Oh.|b
-- and I could hear them,|sd
but I couldn't get them to hang up, you know.|sd
Yeah|b
But I stopped doing that a long time ago,|sd
and they still do it to me.|sd
Even it, in the office I, uh, find that people walk up and, and when you're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy, they'll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up.|sd
Oh, like, s-, -|%
yeah,|b
this lady does that to me at work --|sd

But, you know, it gets annoying when they stand right over you watching everything you do.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, I-, -|%
Let's see, I can't think of anything else --|sd
No|b
About the only thing that really bothers me I don't have that many people coming to my door.|sd
Right.|b
Well, occasionally we'll have a person here or there, but not, not as many as the phone calls,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so. But, -|%
And I guess that's really th-, the thing that really bugs me the most.|sd
I can't think, tha-, -|%
our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me,|sd
but they've all gotten grown up now --|sd
Uh,|%
-- and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me,|sd
Oh|b
but. What else would be an annoyance?|qw
Well, I guess traffic could be an annoyance.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
Especially when you're in a hurry|sd
Do you have a lot of traffic in your area?|qy
Um, it can get busy,|na
yeah.|ny
Usually in the week I'm . -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Some days it's real, real bad here,|sd
and you would like to, feel like it's an invasion of privacy because you can't even ride down the road without people all the way around you,|sd
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
But, -|%
Yeah,|b
I've traveled quiet a bit,|sd
and I've been through Dallas, Texas.|sd
It's pretty busy|sv
It really is,|aa
and pretty noisy.|sv
Yeah|b
It really is.|sv
Yeah.|b
I live right on a main thoroughfare,|sd
so when I first moved here I probably did consider that an invasion of privacy|sd
because it, at first you'd hear a lot of noise, especially at night --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
And every time a, a fire truck or anything went down the road, I would wake up,|sd
but I guess I have gotten used to it because I don't even hear it anymore.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
I suppose you do.|sv
And, uh, I just close it out, I guess, because I don't, I don't remember waking up in several years at night when I'd hear a fire truck go by, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
I think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me|sv
Yeah.|b
I am a real solid sleeper though|sd
so that probably wouldn't bother me.|sv
I'd sleep right through it|sd
They would have to chop down the door and get you out, I guess.|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
It takes a lot.|sd
Let's see. What else is an invasion?|qw
I had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time|sd
Oh.|b
I was mad because those were mine ,|sd
Well, did you have has name all over them?|qy
No|nn
It was a, a letter from a girlfriend of mine.|sd
I, I just, I was upset because those were mine,|sd
and, you know, I thought he, -|sd
That was yours.|bf
Yeah.|%
Right.|aa
I thought he would respect me more than that,|sv
Yeah.|b
so that was upsetting.|sd
I was mad about that and my privacy there.|sd
Yeah.|b
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
what do you think about, uh, the self insurance business?|qw
Well, I watched something on T V a couple of months ago by, uh, General, ex, uh, Surgeon General Koop.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And he talked about Canada's system|sd
and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that,|sv
but the expensive stuff, heart, uh, operations and things, they have a managed scarcity.|sd
And they said that in Canada, there were as many heart, uh, trauma centers as there is in San Francisco.|sd
So in one city of, in America, there's as many, uh, hospitals that are equipped to do hosp-, uh, heart operations as in the entire area of Canada,|sd
and that's kind of spooky.|sv
Well, I, uh, I understand what you're saying,|sd
and there's probably some truth to that.|sv
I think that, uh, generally I don't welcome added government responsibilities.|sv
However, when a, anybody can't police their own profession, it eventually leads to that,|sv
and I think the costs and the, uh, the way the medical profession has, every year -|sd
I, being in my own business, uh, -|sd
in the last six years, every year there's been at least minimum twenty-five percent increase in health insurance costs,|sd
and I think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance, as, as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter. -|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I think they're asking for it.|sv
I, I think the medical profession is just, just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over|sv
and, uh, -|%
Do you think that it's just, uh, medical guys?|qy
What about, you know, you know how expensive new equipment and technology is.|qw
That's where I think most of the cost is coming.|sv
Well, I, I think a lot of it is, uh,|sv
I, I don't disagree totally with that,|arp_nd
but, uh, my wife this last summer, uh, when we were on vacation tore up her knee,|sd
and, uh, uh, it was lig-, ligaments, uh, in her knee,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
she came back that, uh, -|sd
we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened|sd
and, uh, she got home,|sd
and the leading orthopedic man, who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come, -|sd
I mean, he knows knee problems okay,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean if anyone does, this guy knows it.|sd
Well, she goes in,|sd
he says, well, I think this is what it is,|sd
but, uh, you better go to the hospital and have one of these M R I things.|^q
A thousand dollars for this, uh, oh, magnetic, uh, resonance imaging type thing.|sd
And my wife said, well, do I need that?|sd
And he says, well, uh, you know, it, it'll help me diagnose this.|sd
I mean, uh, you know, I, I suggest you go have this thing.|^q
Insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital.|sd
Now, a,|sd
Oh, great.|ba
I mean, doctors routinely send people in for anything.|sv
Now, for years they didn't have this|sd
and they solved these problems,|sv
and, you know, -|%
Yeah .|b
I said to her, well, look, you know, if you feel you got to go, go,|sd
but I, I think a thousand dollars, -|sd
these guys, -|%
I don't know what it is,|sd
but there's,|sv
Uh-huh .|b
And even if they cost a hundred, two hundred, five hundred thousand dollars, at, uh, roughly a thousand dollars every half hour, uh, that's ridiculous.|sv
I, I don't care what anyone says.|sd
You know, the costs are not, -|sv
it's a picture.|sd
It shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that, you know, reasonableness.|sv
But they aren't reasonable.|sv
Fifty, a hundred dollars.|sd
They don't have to pay them back in three months time.|sd
No.|aa
Yeah,|aa
I'll have to agree,|sd
You know .|%
but there's another problem,|sv
and that's the, how litigious our society is.|sv
If the doctor makes a mistake, he can be sure that he's going to be hauled into court.|sv
Well, I think that should be, that, that's a, another problem,|sv
but that's part of our legalese problem.|sv
And that, the government eventually will address too just, you know, because it's out of control.|sv
I, I agree with you.|aa
You know, uh, I was on a jury|sd
or I, I didn't make the jury,|sd
but there was a,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Like it was three days after it was born,|sd
and he was the one that delivered it.|sd
And they got four attorneys,|sd
one guy out of Houston, he introduced himself as snake so-and-so,|sd
and he says, well, anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars,|sd
and I says, yeah,|sd
I got problems with -|^q
I mean, you know, five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back, you know,|sd
I mean, as sorrowful as it is. Uh, you know, if the doctor is wrong, you know, he should be pulled from his license,|sv
but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it, you know,|sd
it, it doesn't make logical sense to me,|sd
but, uh, -|%
No,|aa
it doesn't.|sv
Uh, that's, -|%
You think about AIDS research?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Well, AIDS is a nasty, terrible disease,|sv
and you die from it.|sd
So I think that, uh, they need to look into it|sv
and it's kind of like cancer.|sv
I don't, you know, -|h
how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer.|qh
Uh-huh.|b
I think it'll probably be as difficult.|sv
Uh, how about yourself.|qo
Um, well, I'm certainly in favor of AIDS research,|sd
and I think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does.|sv
I think that -|sv
because, besides the fact that it's a deadly disease, that it's a contagious disease, so that it's, um, -|sd
although it is not killing that many people now, it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem.|sv
Yeah,|b
they say a million people are infected --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, yeah,|%
I think, -|sv
That's in the world, or in America?|qy
You, -|%
Uh, in the country, America.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah --|ny
Um, that's, -|%
-- and they have millions.|sd
Whose figure is that?|qw
I don't know.|sd
I've just heard it on the radio.|sd
Okay.|bk
Sometimes you hear things that, on the radio that, you know, could be true or couldn't be.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, do you feel like this is, -|qy
I, I guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Do you think they should spend more?|qy
Uh, I, I think they should, actually, although prob-, perhaps not a, an incredible amount more than what they're doing,|ng
and I don't necessarily think that they should, uh, fund AIDS research and, in the process, neglect cancer research or whatever.|sv
I think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general.|sv
What do you think, Doug, of Mister Johnson?|qw
Um --|sd
Magic?|qy^d
I, um, I don't know,|h
I don't, I think it's very strange that the media hasn't, um, questioned him more strongly to, about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that, as they probably would for a lot of other people.|sv
Do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of other, a bunch of the media?|qy
Um, well, not, not really, though I mean, I think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position,|ng
but I don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing.|sv
It's what many people have done already, who were just less famous.|sv
You know, I took advantage of the opportunity when, you know, he came out.|sd

Yeah,|ny
yeah|ny
it is.|sd
He's actually, um, -|sd
he had AIDS related complex for a while,|sd
and he is now in full-blown AIDS, really not doing very well, and has a brain tumor or some-, that sort of thing.|sd
Yeah,|b
it sounds awful.|ba
Yeah,|aa
it's, it's a very nasty thing.|sd
Is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly|qy
and, -|%
Um, yeah,|ny
that's, that's basically it, that, um, the immune system can at first slow down,|sd
and the white blood cell count goes down,|sd
which is, that's AIDS Related Complex,|sd
but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom, that's AIDS --|sd
And, -|%

Oh, really.|b

that sort of thing,|sd
Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
well, -|%
There we are.|sd
All right. Um, um, well, uh,|b
tell me about the car that you've got.|ad
Well, I have a Honda, um, hatchback, nineteen eighty-four.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I had a hatchback, a nineteen seventy-eight version before this one.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I'll be honest with you.|sd
I have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and, and, uh, put together|sd
and it, it does its job.|sv
All I have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty-five hundred miles,|sd
and I, I did have to put two, two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles,|sd
but that car just purrs like the day it was built.|sd
I get forty-two miles per gallon on the highway and uh, twen-, twenty-eight to thirty driving around in town.|sd
It's a five speed straight stick machine.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, I can carry more in that, uh, that trunk area in my little Honda than I can in the big cars,|sd
and I have a large, um, Pontiac,|sd
and I have a sixty-nine Cougar, which really is, I'm saving because it's, it's old,|sd
but it's in beautiful shape.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But I can carry as much in my Honda or more than I can in, in those other bigger cars.|sd
Well, that's very interesting.|ba
I've had, I've had exactly the same experience with the one that I've got.|sd
It's a, -|%
and surprisingly it's also an eighty-four --|sd
Oh, oh.|b
-- and, uh, -|%
L X?|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
I'm still here.|sd
Um, I'm sorry what?|br
It was an L X?|qy^d
Yes,|ny
it's an L X,|sd
it's not a hatchback,|sd
but it's, um, it's, uh, -|%
Uh-huh,|b
yours is a four door.|qy^d
Four door,|na
yeah --|ny
Uh-huh.|b
-- and very, very comfortable car.|sv
Big roomy trunk --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- uh, and, uh, and very happy with it,|sd
and I must admit it's, you know, -|sd
if, if, if, uh, -|%
my only consideration were, were, you know, buying another car just to tool around town in and make, you know, brief trips and things like that,|sd
I would very, very seriously consider buying one. Uh,|sd
I think they're extraordinarily reliable cars.|sv
Yes,|aa
they are.|sv
Um, my, my real concern with, uh, uh, why I'm not sure I want to buy a Honda, is because I have to make a kind of a, a steady, um, trip down the road about once a month, because I'm divorced|sd
and I have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina --|sd
Um, uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I drive,|sd
and it's just an absolutely wild highway.|sv
Ninety-five is wild in any car.|sv
There's no doubt about that --|aa
Yeah|b
and, -|%
-- because I, I, I run over to Crystal City, or used to,|sd
I'm retiring the end of this month --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but I'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there.|sd
And, you, well, you've got it,|aa
and, uh, so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine, it's very hard for me to imagine that, that, uh, a Honda's going to be as safe a car as, as the one that I've got my eye on, which is a Volvo.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
In, in fact, quite frankly I've owned a Volvo in the past,|sd
and --|%
Uh-huh.|b
they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service,|sv
but, uh, I've found that I've had a lot of luck with them.|sd
Uh, course I'm a mechanically inclined kind of person,|sd
and I always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that, you know, need to be taken care of, and so forth.|sd
And I guess that's one thing that, that recommends the Honda to a lot of people, is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood,|sv
and, uh, -|%
Yes,|aa
it just, just sits there and purrs,|sd
and you, all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter.|sd
I get six hundred miles on a tank of gas.|sd
Oh, I know.|aa
It's really amazing.|sv
Yeah.|b
It's, uh, -|sv
Beautiful, beautiful machine.|^2
Absolutely,|aa
incredible|ba
So, um, yeah,|%
anyway, I've been looking at the prices of these cars and, and so forth,|sd
and I think that it's, it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're --|sv
Is that right,|bh
uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, um, -|%
Well, a brand new Volvo costs, what, thirty thousand dollars?|qy^d
Well, certainly some of the top end ones.|na
You can still get, get, uh, even the, the low end wagons, um, for less than twenty thousand dollars --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, we get, you know, -|sd
in the Washington area, of course, being as affluent as it is, there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here --|sd
Um, uh-huh.|b
-- so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any, any week,|sd
and I sort of, you know, scan the paper and look at them, and so forth|sd
and --|sd
Yeah.|b
I think I've bought one or two new cars in my life,|sd
and I've tended to, um, to, uh, buy cars that are, you know, two or three, and sometimes even four and five or six years old.|sd
This Honda that I have I bought used,|sd
and, in fact, it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it.|sd
I've just rolled seventy thousand miles,|sd
and it's a seventy-four, I mean, an eighty-four.|sd
So -|%
Well, my, my eighty-four just has seventy-seven on it --|sd
Yeah.|b

and I've, uh, -|%
the weather's been terribly unusual every where I've been.|sd
Oh, you do --|bh
Yeah.|ny
-- so you, you, you probably go everywhere --|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
I imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather.|qy^d
Well, it was around here last night,|na
I'll tell you that|sd
Well, actually I'm, I'm, I've heard on the news that we, uh, will be setting a record here in the State of Texas for the, uh, large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year, that it's going to break all kind of records that were set, set, set back since nineteen thirty-two.|sd
No kidding.|bh
So, yeah|ny
Um.|%
If it keeps on raining like this,|sd
and I understand it's supposed to rain until Saturday night.|sv
Saturday or Sunday they were saying,|sd
yeah.|%
Oh, yes.|b
Yeah,|b
I know the systems have been real strong out.|sd
I went through, uh, Phoenix on, twice on, uh, Wednesday morning --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, approaches to low minimum both, both times --|sd
Wow.|ba
-- and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather|sv
so, -|%
And so are you an airline pilot?|qy
Yes,|ny
I am --|sd
Oh, great.|ba
-- for Southwest,|sd
yeah.|%
For Southwest,|b^m
fantastic.|ba
I have a brother, I have a brother that's a pilot, also, with American.|sd
Oh, is that right?|bh
Yeah.|ny
So I imagine you, uh, oh, with all this kind of weather it, uh, makes it kind of dangerous for you.|qy^d
Well, now, I wouldn't call it danger.|ng
This is, uh, this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in.|sd
This is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the Springtime.|sd
Oh, I guess so,|sv
yeah.|aa
Yeah,|b^m
the, the air systems are reasonably calm.|sd
We don't have, uh, the turbulence --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it's not like it is in the spring time.|sd
Oh, yes.|aa
Well, we moved actually down here from another location,|sd
and it's spectacular the, the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time, the torrents of rain.|sv
Spectacular is the right word for them.|aa
Pardon me?|br
Spectacular is a good word for them|aa
I've never seen a thunder show like I've seen down here before in Texas.|sd
It's amazing.|sv
Lights up the whole sky and even on a, on a, -|sd
actually I've, I've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky,|sd
it's a cloudless night,|sd
and the rain isn't falling,|sd
but you can see the thunder, and, excuse me, see the lightening going horizontally across the sky --|sd
Oh, yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Yeah --|b
It's, it's fabulous.|sv
-- cloud to cloud it can be real, really sensational here.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|sv
Where are you from originally?|qw
I'm from, uh, northern Utah,|sd
and that's a very arid climate, from, uh, Salt Lake City area --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and there's always a lot of snow.|sd
In fact, where I grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to, uh, twelve different major ski resorts,|sd
and so --|sd
Oh.|b
and because it was an arid climate, the snow was always a crisp, powder, light snow --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
So, we had a great time.|sd
Were you near, near the Park Cities area.|qy
Um, yeah,|ny
in, uh --|sd
Beautiful area.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So I imagine, have you skied before?|qy
Well, we've skied,|na
I have not skied that area.|sd
Uh-huh.|bk
I've driven through it several times.|sd
Uh, I skied, we skied California a bunch when we lived out there,|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we do some skiing there --|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
Yeah,|b
great.|ba
Well, do you think this, the, the weather is typical for this time of the year?|qy
Well, not really,|ng
I, you know, -|%
Minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow, um,|sd
the, um, uh, -|%
we've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already --|sd
Yes.|aa
Yeah.|b
-- and, uh, I've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today, you know, that moved in last night.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's been, it's been cold.|sv
There was a time, though, in the, uh, middle part of November that got really cool, really, really --|sv
Yes.|aa
Yes,|aa
it did.|sv
-- and then it warmed right back up,|sd
and I thought, great --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and that's, that's a fun th-, -|sv
yeah,|%
my wife was just listening here|sd
and she said, yeah,|sd
it froze in fact.|^q
Yeah,|b
it was, it was real cold.|sv
Yeah,|%
but that was very unseasonable for us down here.|sv
And, uh, but, uh, I've really enjoyed the weather down here, too,|sd
because, uh, two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weat-, weather,|sd
and it's not as severe, I should say --|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh, yeah,|aa
that's, that's real true.|sv
Same with us from Minnesota.|sd
It's, it's, uh, -|%
in fact, I've, I've played golf on, on, uh, New Year's Day one year.|sd
Down here?|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
Not in Minnesota|qy^d
No|nn
no,|nn
no|nn
no.|nn
I have a brother-in-law that lives in Minnesota|sd
and they say, boy, six months out of the year it's bitter cold, and --|sd
Oh, it is,|aa
it is.|aa
Well, and they've had, uh, you know, -|%
usually in Minnesota they get their snow in January --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they're up over sixty-five or sixty-, -|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
should begin. *listen; could probably code if we could tell if it said "we" or "you"|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Okay.|aa
All right.|aa
Uh, I can begin this, um,|sd
basically I work for Honeywell in Minneapolis --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and the, the benefit program we have here is really quite good.|sv
I'm, I'm pretty pleased with it.|sd
They cover, uh, just about everything, vision, dental, medical --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- uh, you name it,|ad
and for me this is the first job I've had where they've covered that much,|sd
so I'm pretty satisfied myself.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, what's your situation?|qw
I work for the University of New Hampshire,|sd
and --|sv
Oh.|b
overall I'm satisfied with it.|sd
We don't have the vision care,|sd
we do have the health care and the, uh, and the medi-, or the dental.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh.|%
Are you a professor there?|qy
No,|nn
I work in, I'm a, on the professional administrative and technical staff,|sd
and I, effectively I run the telephone switch at, uh, at the University of New Hampshire.|sd
Oh, I see,|bk
okay.|bk
Uh, so the, uh, the benefits,|sd
uh, probably the main thing I like about the benefits is the, uh, the, uh, very generous vacation time and sick time.|sd
Oh, no doubt|aa
We get fifteen days a year sick time,|sd
and, uh, we get twenty-four days a year, right from the day one when you start work, you get twenty-four days a year, uh, time off.|sd
Right.|b
Well, that's good.|ba
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b^m
that's one of the things I guess I would change about Honeywell, is, uh, -|sd
I used to work with the Army Research Institute,|sd
and being a, uh, a government organization you got quite a few holidays off.|sd
Right.|b
But here you don't get that.|sd
You maybe get two or three a year.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So it's really, -|%
unless you, unless you have some vacation time or some, some sick leave or whatever, um, you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So, that's, that's kind of a drawback I think.|sv
But, uh. I don't know.|h
What do you consider most important, you think, in terms of, of the different benefits?|qw
Well, I think, uh, the, the health care, of course, is an important, and has to be the single most important benefit --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing, uh --|sd
Yeah.|b
I'm, I'm a little disturbed about that,|sd
but I think that's a national trend,|sv
and I don't know that, uh, I don't know what the solution is to it.|sd
It's bigger than just the benefits part.|sv
Yeah,|b
I don't know if you saw on TWENTY TWENTY the other night,|sd
they, uh, they basically reviewed Oregon's plan --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
It's kind of an interesting plan.|sv
It's kind of cold though.|sv
They've essentially made up a list of, uh, oh, all the different, uh, medical maladies that you can have --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
about six hundred and eighty-seven and below will not be covered by, by, uh, subsidized health care,|sd
and the ones above would.|sd
Um.|%
So it's kind of like drawing this line|sd
and, and if you have it great,|sd
if you don't, you're kind of out of luck --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, um, it was kind of an interesting show.|sv
Um.|%
I think you're right,|sd
I think health care is probably the, the most pressing --|sv
Right.|b
but I'll tell you, I, I don't mind having dental, you know,|sd
sometimes dental costs can be, um, just about as expensive, if not more,|sv
and I know historically a lot of companies I think carried dental as a rider along with the medical --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but I'm not sure that's, that's widely followed any more.|sv
I'm not sure,|sd
how, how does, uh, University of New Hampshire handle it?|qw
Well, we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental, uh, depending,|sd
and, and the cost between them is very, is very little.|sd
I think it costs me something like five dollars a, a month for the dental plan.|sv
Um.|%
But it pays, uh, a substantial amount.|sd
I mean, the examinations and, and, uh, checkups every year, or every six months are free --|sd
Great.|ba
-- and, uh, it, it covers the bulk of the dental expenses.|sd
Is that, uh, let me interrupt, is that the same for both, uh, professors and, and also staff and administration,|qy
is that generally across the board, do you think|qy
or, -|%
Uh, yes,|ny
it is.|sd
The benefits plan is different for operating, for what we call operating staff, which are considered to be, uh, clerical personnel, accountants, things like that --|sd
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- but the main, -|%
I think the, the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody, and the retirement plan.|sv
But --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, okay.|bk
Uh, for the operating staff it's on a seniority, it's, you know, based on how long they've worked there.|sd
Right.|b
That determines how much, uh, vacation time they get.|sd
Yeah,|b
I'm kind of interested because I'm actually, that's the route I'd like to take when I finally get my degree --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I'm a doctoral student in Florida right now --|sd
Oh.|b
-- but, uh, -|%
yeah,|b
that's, that's interesting.|sv
That's one of the things I'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would, uh, they would cover and things like that.|sd
College programs belong to this T I A A, uh, C R E F retirement fund.|sd
Oh, is that right?|bh
Right,|na
and in the case of the University of New Hampshire, uh, -|sd
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
All right.|b
What's your view.|qw
Huh?|br
What's your view?|qw
Well, I have a hard time thinking that they can control guns.|sv
Yeah|b
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|sv
I mean, -|%
You know, even if they give it a shot, it's still going to be black market all over the place, you know,|sv
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
I don't know.|h
Coming from Texas you're probably, -|qy^d
I don't know|h
I shouldn't make stereo types,|sd
but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there I would think.|sv
Yeah.|aa
It is,|sd
but I'm not really from I'm not really from Texas,|sd
I just live down here now.|sd
I've --|sd
Oh, you're just live down there?|br
Yeah.|ny
I'm originally from Colorado,|sd
but yeah --|%
Oh well.|b
-- there, uh, there, uh there's a lot of hunters here.|sd
Yeah,|b
well I know how you feel.|sv
I'm, uh, I grew up in Nebraska|sd
and, and we always use to go out and hunt all the time, you know|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's just, -|%
I don't know.|h
I just think, I think it's ridiculous.|sv
Yeah.|b
I mean, -|%
It doesn't sit with me very well.|sd
I don't know, I, anymore|sd
I keep a thirty-eight in my truck, you know.|sd
Really.|bh
Yeah,|ny

well I live in Minneapolis|sd

well actually I live in Florida,|sd
but I am staying in Minneapolis for a year|sd
and --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
-- and it's just, you never know who is out there.|sd
Right.|b
You know it's just for self protection purposes|sd
and then of course there's the hunting issue,|sd
so -- -|%
Sure.|b
-- yeah|b
that's good.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
What do you do, Jeff?|qw
Uh, I, I'm in, uh, program control for a company up here.|sd
Oh, yeah.|bh
Yeah.|ny
All right.|bk
We do schedules, for --|sd
Yeah.|b
What do you do?|qw
I'm, uh, researcher of Honeywell up here.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
So, uh, -|%
yeah.|b
You guys uh, do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything|qy
or, -|%
Uh, I haven't had a chance to do any hunting since I've been down here.|ng
I don't own a shotgun,|sd

So. -|%
Yeah,|b
uh, when I was in Colorado we went deer and elk hunting --|sd

Yeah.|b
All right.|%
Yeah,|%
my brother was, uh, a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and, uh, really enjoyed it quite a bit,|sd
but I don't know.|h
I guess that what the scale now is, it's zero for, uh, for a complete, -|sv
One for a total ban --|^2
That's right.|aa
I guess I am about eight or nine|sv
Yeah,|aa
I, I agree with you there|sd
Yeah,|b
no doubt about it|sv
but, uh, -|%
I mean, if they can anyway get it, keep criminals from having guns which they can't --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- I, you know, I'm not --|sd
Yeah,|b
if there's --|sd
they, I guess they passed a couple of, uh, uh, laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then they actually, uh, -|sd
I know it's this way in Florida.|sd
They have a waiting period where you buy one|sd
and that's a week --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that.|sd
I think that's a pretty good idea.|sd
Uh, and that's, -|%
I don't know,|sd
that's not a bad idea,|sv
but then again you can always get around that.|sv
You could go through the black market like you say.|sd
You know, you always be able to get around|sv
but, uh, -|%
Sure.|b
Yeah,|b
it's one of things|sv
but, uh, I don't know.|h
I guess, I guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like I'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I don't either|sd
Yeah,|b
I'm just not, -|%
I think those have been pretty much, you know, banned altogether anyway.|sv
Yeah,|b
I -- -|%
There, -|%
-- fully auto, -|%
but, even well, I mean, a semiautomatic, I guess that's, -|sv
It kind of takes the sport out of hunting|sv
Yeah.|aa
Right.|aa
You know, it's like what can you do with that, that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve.|qh
Sure.|b
You know, you might do the same thing.|sv
Right.|b
And so it's like, I don't know. It does.|h
It takes the sport out of it.|sv
For me I would much rather have a bow anytime|sv
Oh, really.|b
I, I like bows.|sd
You know, I have done some bow hunting|sd
and I, uh, I get into it|sd
and I think it's more of a challenge, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, uh, I don't know.|h
I guess it keeps the shell makers in business.|sv
Sure.|b
But, uh, I don't know.|h
Anyway, that's about where I stand|sd

You, uh, -|%

I am about the same way.|sd

it's about seven fifteen.|sd
You guys central?|qy
How is the weather up there?|qw
Oh, it's not too good.|sd
It's kind of rainy actually.|sd
Is it?|qy
Around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about, uh, I don't know, ten or twenty degrees --|sd
Right.|b
-- and it's been up around forty.|sd
So people are, people are whining about the rain and stuff, but not too bad about the temperature.|sd
Ice is starting to melt and stuff like that|sd
so. -|%

I am just up here for the year|sd

Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Wonderful touch tone telephone there.|sv
Uh, what kind of books do you enjoy reading?|qw
Uh, haven't, have, I have a wide variety of, of hobbies,|^h
therefore, my, my reading pleasures are quite wide.|sd
Um, I get a charge out of, uh, TEXAS HIGHWAY,|sd
Oh.|b
Right,|b
I've read that one too.|sd
I only had a subscription once,|sd
but my mother always gave me hers|sd
and I, I really enjoyed, you know, all the little things that you find out about Texas.|sd
Oh yeah,|b
it's, it's, uh, absolutely, it's great the way that it's broken out and you can, uh, set up little trips and day trips and things.|sv
It's pretty, pretty neat.|sv
Um, oh, I like photography, um, magazines.|sd
I don't take a subscription or anything like that.|sd
Um, things, oh, -|%
being an engineer in facilities I do read a lot of, a lot of, uh, building magazines and, and, and plant engineering magazines and, read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then I'll sit up and read just to refresh, uh, you know, to keep active on it,|sd
but, uh. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
How about yourself?|qo
Well, um, I have an interest in art,|sd
so I, frequently purchase and read, uh, books, mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment.|sd
Oh, that's great.|ba
And, uh, oh, I guess I like a variety of things, uh, lots of fiction, uh, type books.|sd
Uh, right now I'm occasionally reading on a book about, uh, the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's fairly interesting.|sv
I bet that would be, rather interesting.|aa
Uh, that's, uh, self improvement,|sv
that's, that's alwa-, well, that's kind of a hobby|sv
but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh.|sv
Yeah,|b
I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.|sd
How about you?|qo
Um, well I hate to, -|h
yes,|ny
I do|sd
We, uh, we have these classes we attend, uh, management classes|sd
and, and they give you books|sd
and, and the last book, uh, matter of fact I read was, AT AMERICA'S SERVICE by Carl Albrecht .|sd
It talks about, uh, who the customer is and being customer oriented, uh, which falls in line with the T I culture here at Texas Instruments.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, one of its great slogans is if you're not serving the customer, you better be serving someone who is.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is|sv
and as you probably well know, all of us are our own customer.|sd
You're my customer, I'm your customer, sort of thing.|sd
Right.|b
Um, every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the, uh, in the car cassette set on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable, talking about, uh, better outlooks on things and the philosophy of, of Pat Hagerty and these kind of, uh, mind stimulating philosophy type.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
well, uh, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean they are|sv
but I don't label it as such.|sd
Like what for example.|qw^d
Well, I don't know, um,|h
I, uh, have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them, but, uh, I guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things,|sd
but, uh, they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself. You know ge-, getting your, yourself in gear to, uh, sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do.|sd
Sure.|b
Sure.|b
How about items like, um, THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a big, -|qy
okay.|%
Yes.|aa
So those are self improvements.|sv
Sure.|aa
Um, our supervisor, uh, subtly bought all of us a book called WHAT EVERY SUPERVISOR SHOULD KNOW.|sd
Um.|%
and it's a very layman's, uh, uh, approach towards managing different types of people.|sd
And the very last chapter, and I haven't figured out why that one was last, is how to manage engineers|sd
So it's, it's ver-, it's interesting,|sv
here again it's, it's casual reading|sv
and it's not eaten up with a lot of, uh, mechanical stuff|sd
and it's really excellent fast reading|sv
and, uh, but as you say it's, it's sometimes it's difficult to, to know if it's, you know, -|sv
I think if somebody would say hey, read these ten books because these are self-improvements, I would probably be turned off to them.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
If he casually just walked into it and, uh, put down a Stephen King book and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested.|sd
I don't know,|ar
I'm not sure I could take too much of Stephen King.|sv
That's a little, little heavy for me.|sv
Yeah,|b
they're, uh, quite, uh, they're hard to set down because it's so interesting|sv
and, of course, they're all just a little spookier than the movies,|sv
but, uh,|sv
Yeah.|b
I have a hard time finishing books.|sd
Well I guess I also have been reading, uh, a lot of things on, uh, quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what I'm involved in a lot at work.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
In quality, especially now days, uh, that's almost everything that comes across the, the, the airways .|sd
Oh, yeah,|aa
you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other|sv
but, uh,|sv
Exactly, exactly right.|aa
but, -|%
Yeah, we, we have, I think we, we name drop it a little too much and, and don't fully understand what, what it is we're saying.|sv
I think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk|sv
and, and all that kind of rolls in together there,|sv
Yeah.|b
but, uh, that's just kind of part of it.|sv
Okay,|b
well, any other comments.|qy
Uh, not that I can think of.|ng
Um, I think I'm under my quota a little bit.|sv
I need to probably make a phone call or two|sd

I don't know about you|sd
but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work|sd
and it varies like every day. I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next|sd
It's pretty bad,|sv
but it's true, you know, in|sv
they tend to try to be, you know, real lax|sd
and supposedly the policy is like, you know, we, you know, we, hire these wonderful creative people|sd
and we don't want to smush their creativity, you know.|sd
We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want.|sd
And, you know, you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next.|sd
Well, I'm kind of that way too.|sd
I work in the legal department|sd
and where we are now, what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day,|sd
it always seems like I'm doing that|sv
and I can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry, you know, boxes of documents around,|sv
so, if I'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing, you know, odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents, I dress down.|sd
But if we're going to have a meeting, where we're having the attorneys come in, or people from, uh, other party's attorneys and stuff, then I normally dress up.|sd
Yeah,|%
and I'll wear a dress and hose and stuff.|sd
Yeah,|b
you know, we're kind of that way too.|sd
I try to, -|sd
I'm the same way you are,|sv
I kind of try to judge from day to day.|sd
I know, you know, where I am we work a lot with the customers|sd

Uh-huh.|b
and if I know they're not, you know, -|sd
I, I've been doing a lot of reorganization, you know, the last couple of months the same way you are, you know,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it's just , it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress.|sv

that's right.|aa

As a matter of fact, I thought I had one funny story|sd
when, uh, I was at T I the first year or so, we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes.|sd
We had them in the warehouse,|sd
Uh.|%
and at that point, it, the warehouse was over across the road|sd
and it wasn't air conditioned,|sd
and, it, we were there like in the middle of the summer,|sd
it's unair-conditioned,|sd
it was dusty and dirty, uh,|sd
there was like a fan at the very end of the row|sd
and that was it.|sd
And so, we didn't really know we weren't supposed to, -|sd
we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
we wore shorts.|sd
We didn't know that was a big no, no.|sd
Oh no.|ba
And the supervisor from another area came up to us|sd
and, you know, this area where record retention is, there's only a few people that work there,|sd
and he, sho-, he knew who worked there,|sd
he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there.|sd
And he came up to us|sd
and he just said, who's your supervisor.|sd
Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor, and our supervisor's supervisor,|sd
and it went up all the way to the head of facilities,|sd
Oh no in|ba
He didn't at, at least say to us, did you know you're not supposed to do that.|sd
That could have alleviated a big problem.|sv
We ended up getting called out on it.|sd
Oh, how awful.|ba
It sounds like Mister Power Hungry.|sv
Yeah.|aa
You know, just yesterday, though, I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I don't care,|sd
you can call them split skirts|sd
and you can call them culottes all you want|sd
but these were shorts.|sv
That's all they were.|sd
I don't care what else you call them, you know,|sd
if they're below the knee, okay,|sv
maybe you can call them split skirts.|sv
If they're above the knee they turn into shorts, you know.|sv
And these weren't even really full ones.|sd
I mean they had a problem out here with it last summer, wearing these shorts that were, you know, the real wide full ones, you know,|sd
and becau-, these weren't even those.|sd
These were like pretty short, black,|sd
and they were very dressy,|sd
the were black velvet shorts|sd
and she had on black hose and black heels|sd
and she looked very, very nice.|sd
Um.|%
But, you don't wear shorts to work.|sv
You know, I mean, as far as I'm considered, she was in violation|sv
and nobody says anything to them.|sd
It's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime.|sd
Um.|%
You know, if they just, you know, -|%
the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an, cut off, you know, that no,|sv
this is wear we're going to draw the line.|^q
This is shorts, you know.|^q
Yeah.|b
And, and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that, you know,|sd
Um.|%
so, it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going, well God, we have a pair of those at home too.|sv
It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear, you know,|^q
but. -|%
Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine.|sd
Yeah.|b
And they have said no|sd
Yeah|b
and then during the week you see these women, in the you know,|sd
just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
I mean I've never seen them do it without hose,|sd
I mean they always have hose on,|sd
but still, it's, they're shorts,|sd
I don't care what you say,|sd
they're shorts.|sd
Well I think T I's dress code is pretty lax considering everything, anyway, you know, uh.|sv
I know, I didn't know that E D S has a very strict dress code,|sd
I had a friend,|sd
Oh do they really?|qy
Oh definitely.|na
I had a friend who worked there for a year or so|sd
and they spell it out.|sd
For men it's particular suits, uh, the pin stripe, and the particular colors of shirts and win-, wing tipped shoes.|sd
Oh, my God.|ba
Oh, it is definitely lined out.|sd
Women are not allowed to wear slacks,|sd
you wear coordinated suits.|sd
I coul-, I couldn't afford to work there.|sd
And, and a particular kind of shoe, you know, so high heel,|sd
oh it is spelled out.|sd
Oh, no.|ba
When I was looking at her materials when she first started, you know, she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it told about the dress code|sd
and it said, these are the color pastel shirts you may wear, or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and, hair just this way.|sd
T I -s says no shorts and no halters|sd
I know, that's it.|sd
Yeah,|b
and E D S is very particular about this, hair cuts,|sd
Wow.|ba
I mean it was like you can't have, you know, such and such facial hair, no beards, you know, and just really detailed.|sd
I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in.|sv
I mean, I see,|%
I, I am more, -|sd
I don't know about anybody else,|sd
and a lot of bosses may say I'm nuts,|sd
but I am more productive when I'm in pants.|sv
I, I am.|sv
I work faster,|sv
I get things done faster, than when I'm in a dress and heels, you know,|sv
I, -|%
and it's weird|sv
but I, it's I do, I can, I can get so much more done if I'm dressed comfortable, you know.|sv
Well the, the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had, uh, another person coming from Washington, our outside counsel.|sd
And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse|sd
but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse, but the warehouse.|sd
Right.|b
And she came with skirts, just like she'd be going into the office.|sd
Yeah.|b
And we'd try, we'd try to say, didn't you bring any pants or anything.|sd
We're, we're out here in the warehouse, you know,|^q
you, you got your skid of, you know, that wooden pallet of boxes.|^q
Uh-huh.|b
and you're going to have un-, unload you skid look at the documents in the, in the boxes and then repack your skid.|^q
And she|sd
You can't do that in a skirt poor soul.|bf
Oh yuck.|ba
She finally tried to go buy, you know, a pair of pants|sd
but, you know, I mean it was just completely miserable for her.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's terrible,|ba
that's terrible|ba
gosh.|ba
Well I don't know,|h
I just figure, you know, yeah,|sd
sometimes I worry about, you know, if I go in in pants,|sd
and I never, I never ever, ever, ever go in in a pair of jeans, you know.|sd
But I'll go in in pants.|sd
I mean today I had on a pair of, you know, navy blue dress slacks and, and, uh, like a peach colored top and, you know, not cruddy, but not a dress either.|sd
And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would, will hold you back, you know, if you don't dress in, you know, your dress for success business suits everyday if, you know, if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on,|sd
but, you know, I don't know if they do or not.|sd
You know, I see a lot of the managers|sd
and they're in jeans,|sd
so, you know. -|%
Some of our people in the legal department, -|sd
we have, um, assistants to the general counsel|sd
and it's funny|sv
because, there's one that always wears a suit.|sd
A matter of fact, he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on, buttoned.|sd
Really, wow.|ba
And then there's another one who's, who's a little younger and a little more yuppish|sd
and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and, you know, a shirt,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it.|sd
Yeah.|b
And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes|sd
and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt.|sd
So that's just, -|%
Isn't that funny.|bh
With the, you know, the little suspenders or something on|sd
so.|sd
That's great.|ba
but, I think a lot of times it's, it's mainly who they're going to meet with,|sv
or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are.|sd
Yeah.|b
If they're just going to be meeting with T I -ers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the, they're engineers that they're talking too, they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed|sd
and they're usually casual.|sd
That's the way to do it. I mean that's the smart way to do it.|sv
Yeah.|b
It really is, because your making, you know, -|sv
if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down, if they come in, in, you know, a six hundred dollar three piece suit, it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable, you know,|sv
or it would me, you know.|h
It's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here.|bf
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
look at this slick guy,|ad
I wonder what kind of money does he make,|sd
uh-huh|%
I can see it now.|sd
Well it was good to talk to you.|fc
It was really enjoyable.|fc
Yeah,|fc
this is, this is kind of a fun project.|fc
It really is.|aa
I've done some of the other speech programs,|sd
but we've never got to talk to another person,|sd
it was always just talking to the computer.|sd
Oh, yuck,|ba
yeah.|b
So this is a little different.|sv
Well it's kind of enjoyable,|sv
I'm really looking forward to it.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well thanks a lot.|ft
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
The question was, um, what, what is your opinion of youth, uh, spending a year or two in, in public service.|sd
I think it would be a great idea.|sv
I'm not sure about requiring it, you know, of people, because people are going, you know, feeling resentful.|sv
I don't know,|h
but I think it would be a great idea.|sv
Yeah.|b
Seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of, you know, what they want to be or do|sv
or, you know, they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time|sv
and we, sure, our country, all countries sure need help|sv
so, -|%
Huh-uh.|b
Would, uh, would you be more in favor of, uh, you know, like a local, uh, -|qy
my only experience with it, I was in Central America for a while,|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Huh-uh.|b
For instance, everybody had what they called there social year,|sd
Oh, really.|b
and basically it was a, uh, repayment for, for, uh, high school education,|sd
Huh-uh.|b
and most of them joined the Red Cross|sd
and it was done internally.|sd
I just, -|%
there was very little external.|sd
I think possibly what, uh, they're thinking about here, more external Peace Corps,|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, I think that would be real interesting for people to do,|sv
but, I guess, my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them, you know, to other countries,|sv
Huh-uh.|b
and, but, I don't know.|h
If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to really, you know, send children to do that. -|sv
Yeah.|b
I didn't know.|sd
I don't, I don't know how the Peace Corps works,|sd
I, guess I was of age when the Peace Corps came in,|sd
Yeah,|b
I was too.|sd
I thought seriously about joining at that time,|sd
I thought it was a fantastic idea.|sv
Did you ever get any information on it like, -|qy
I sent off for stuff on it,|sd
but I don't remember that much. about it.|sd
I know that they trained you in the language|sd
and, um, -|%
That's what I was wondering about was whether they actually, -|sd
You actually got paid too, while in the Peace Corps,|sd
it wasn't much,|sv
Yeah.|b
but I guess, they, you could put some money aside while you were there, your expenses and, -|sv
Wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I think so,|sv
yeah,|ny
yeah|ny
But it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a, and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here, and take them to some other country that had different moral values like Saudi Arabia where they couldn't drink|sv
Where they couldn't do that.|bf
Yeah,|%
you might end up with a revolution.|sv
I don't know which end though.|sv
Really|b
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
That's, that's been interesting, though, the kids that have been over, you know, coming back right now, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
You wonder if being exposed to that for a while, what percentage of them would actually say, Hey, that's not a bad way to do it,|sv
because from what I understand, from some of the guys I know, you know, crime, uh, is punishable, just almost, uh, instantly and --|sv
Public hanging.|^2
yeah.|aa
Public hanging and this sort of thing, you know,|sd
so you don't have just a whole lot of,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
I've heard that like in China and stuff, there is virtually no such thing as rape, because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered, you know, on the, you know, street|sv
so, -|%
Yeah.|b
Well, I guess that's, uh, the price of freedom, I guess, is a little, anyway,|sv
the, uh, uh, the, the public service thing again -|sd
I, I, I guess, in my own, having had the whole three or four minutes to, you know, give it a great deal of thought, you know,|sv
but when you do that then it becomes almost, uh, a , -|sv
or it can be,|%
Yeah.|b
You know, there have, -|%
people will kind of set up their own little club,|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|sv
And, uh, but if, you know, -|%
People that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation, you know, like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that.|sv
Yeah.|b
Might not go if it was voluntary,|sv
but I don't know how they'd enforce it,|sd
if it was, -|%
Yeah,|b
well, if they went AWOL, what are you going to do.|qh
Yeah.|b
Shoot them.|ad
Put them in jail|ad
I don't know.|h
Send them over to Iraq|ad
Yeah,|aa
right.|aa
Have a vacation in Iraq for a year|ad
I know my dad always talked about, uh, -|sd
he was in C C C during, uh, -|sd
Yeah.|b
And he was, uh, a rock rib Iowa type republican|sd
and the only good thing he could ever say about, uh, the whole Roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,|sd
Huh-uh.|b
because he was in it.|sd
He thought that was great.|sd
Yeah.|b
The rest of it was all hog wash,|sd
but that was great.|sd
Well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.|sv
It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled that way.|sv
I, I, -|%
it would take quite a few people.|sv
I think it might build jobs for people, you know, that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that,|sv
so maybe that part of it would be helpful too.|sv
Yeah.|b
I don't know.|h
Yeah|b
the only, -|%
Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and -|sd
Well, you know that brings up the interesting subject too, you know,|sv
what would you have, who, who, who would determine what these people do.|qw
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
You know, if, uh, you know, if it's run by the individual state. -|sv
You know like C C C was run by the army|sd
and in effect, -|%
Huh-uh.|b
and the only opposition to it really was that it was, you know, starting some sort of a military elitist type, you know, special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing.|sv
Huh-uh.|b
And, uh, when the politics get real confusing, -|sv
Yeah,|b
really there could be, um, some scandals involved, if, you know, it wasn't people that were really fair and le-,|sv
Yeah.|b
they could send all the people over to, uh, you know, one particular part of town or one particular project, that somebody had paid somebody to, you know, get supported,|sv
or, -|%
Yeah.|b
Well, -|%
We've gotten to the point where, you know, if, if, well, if the racial make up of the group was such and such, you know, they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and, you know,|sv
Yeah.|b
That could be a complicated too, couldn't it.|qy
Oh, yeah.|ny
Yeah.|b^m
Suppose, uh, well, you know, they had a group who were construction oriented|ad
and they went and they, they built, uh, can't think of a good example, a swimming pool, or anything, you know,|sd
and one, you can, you can only build it in one place, you know,|sd
and know matter where you build it, somebody else is going to scream, well, you didn't build one over here.|sv
Yeah.|aa
That's true.|sv
Unfair or something,|bf
yeah.|%
Yeah.|ny
I think, uh, -|%
oh, boy|ba
It's one of those things on the surface, you know, it seems like a great idea.|sv
It's like a joke I heard once about, uh, elephant foot soup, you know,|sd
it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot.|sd
It's, uh, the logistics of the thing that, uh,|sv
Yeah.|b
Really.|b
Yeah.|b
Well, it seems like there's, there's a lot, -|sv
you don't hear much on the news about young people really, you know, wanting to do anything good or anything like that,|sv
but you know, I'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing.|sv
I just, I saw on the news the other night that the, uh, the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show, Kisha Knight Pullman, was starting a, -|sd
I guess now she's practically a teenager,|sd
Yeah.|b
She started some type of, um, national organization for youth to volunteer to teach, tutor other kids to read and, you know, do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards, you know, helpful things,|sd
and I know everyone like in the high schools in Dallas,|sd
there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a, um, minority, you know, -|sd
I think it was in a Hispanic area,|sv
they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers, instead of, they said, all these gangs kids could join to belong.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
But they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing, helping, you know,|sd
Yeah.|b
so they were trying to start that out,|sd
so if there's people out there that are willing to, you know, kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy. Gosh, we ought to use them.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
it's, it's , it's just the, you know, -|%
here you are to the logistics of the thing again, you know.|sv
Yeah.|b
Who's going to run it, you know,|qh
what,|qh
how,|qh
oh, it's just so many -- -|sv
Yeah.|b
-- Like, like I said at the beginning I've got so many connections with people in Central America.|sd
My daughter-in-law is Panamanian, you know,|sd
Huh-uh.|b
and they have situations like, like that down there.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
if you want to go to school outside the country, and many Salvadorians did, they'd go to school in Cornell, Iowa, of all places,|sd
Huh-uh.|b
and when they came back, they'd have to serve this, this year,|sd
and it turned out to be kind of a joke,|sd
the ones I knew, you know, always chose the Red Cross, because they didn't do anything --|sd
Oh, I see.|b
-- And they had all kinds of, uh, things they could go into, agricultural, and you know,|sv
Yeah.|b
but, uh, unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that, Red Cross, it was so many of them in it, that at any particular chance, your chance of having to do something was, it was very slim.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
And so, -|%
Well, we, um, belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which is like the Mormon church.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Huh-uh.|b
And, um, there, there is men and also women,|sd
women aren't nearly as frequent,|sd
and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left, that can volunteer to go on a mission|sd
and, um, they're all over the world.|sd
And, its incredible logistics,|sv
I mean, they have a training center where they teach them,|sd
it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah,|sd
and they have,|sd
Yeah.|b
and then they, um, you know, go and actually live in that country for the, the, uh, -|sd
young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months.|sd
Okay.|b
Then that's, uh, kind of a private organization,|qy^d
Right.|na
you know, I'm, I'm familiar with, -|sd
my instructor pilot was a Mormon,|sd
he was, he was a good construction, uh, you know, in-, instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible,|sv
Oh, yeah|b
He had a direct connection somewhere, uh|bf
Yeah,|aa
right|aa
He felt that he really had an in|sd
so,|sd
Yeah.|b
but any rate that's off the subject,|sd
Yeah.|b
But, I, -|%
They, they don't get paid for it,|sd
and, um, but there is funding that comes,|sd
they're supposedly saving up on their own|sd
and the church helps them out some,|sd
Huh-uh.|b
but, you know, that it is incredible, you know.|sv
I see how they were organized in,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, uh,|%
Yeah.|b
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I'll let you start first, okay?|qy
Okay.|na
We, um, I'm presently living in a house, uh,|sd
first time, uh, -|sd
we had the house built|sd
and so this is our, our fifth year in it I guess,|sd
and, uh, um, it was a real excitement to, uh, to go out and select the house and have one made and built|sd
and like you wanted it, we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses.|sd
And, um, as we did with probably ninety-five percent of the people here in Dallas-Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home,|sd
and they're good for about five years or four years|sd
and after that they start falling apart.|sd
So, I would, uh, not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in, uh, because they're overpriced, uh,|sd
but they're a cheap house.|sd
If you can't afford something good, you know,|sd
they're good for that,|sv
and, um, you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head,|sd
but as far as the costs for what your getting, uh, the longevity of the house is not, uh, is not worth it.|sv
How about in your case?|qo
Well, in my case my husband is not a carpenter,|sd
but, in fact, he's in electronics,|sd
but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it.|sd
So it took him about two and a half years,|sd
but, uh, he built us a house,|sd
it's, uh, -|%
we have thirty-two hundred square feet,|sd
and it's a brick house,|sd
and price-wise, it was great because he did it all himself, you know,|sd
so that way he could, we could kind of control,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, we live in kind of a small town,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I mean it's nothing fancy, you know,|sd
it's, it's a house,|sd
it's nice,|sv
and it's real pretty|sv
and we're all comfortable in it.|sd
Well, that's great,|ba
that's great,|ba
that's, uh, -|%
I've heard, -|sd
I have another gentleman, friend of mine, who, uh, who had a house built|sd
as a matter of fact another guy is building one now,|sd
he's been doing it for three years|sd
and the city's a little upset with him,|sd
but I understand you save a lot of money off, uh, by doing that,|sd
and, uh, -|%
Oh, you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else.|sd
Nothing wrong with that,|sv
You know.|%
uh, I'll vouch for that.|sd
Um,|%
But, uh, of course, my husband did everything except -|sd
my brother's a trim carpenter,|sd
and he came in, you know, and did the inside for us,|sd
and that helped.|sd
That was a big savings.|bf
And, uh, -|%
yes,|aa
and, uh, we had to hire, of course, the plumbing and the brick and everything else, nothing, you know,|sd
Well, that's great.|ba
W-, uh, have you been in it long?|qy
Oh, really,|b
well, have you any plans to, uh, maybe, uh, expand or move onward?|qy
N-, no,|nn
we're, -|%
well, uh, our kids are kind of still small now,|sd
and we had thought before maybe a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it,|sd
but he will not build a second one himself.|sd
I see,|b
well, -|%
First one is always a bear.|sv
Yes,|aa
yes.|aa
We're having a, an architect friend of mine design a house for us|sd
and that can basically be, be put on any lot, in any state, any kin-, you know,|sd
so that's kind of,|sd
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it|sd
and he's re-, certified, and registered|sd
so at least we know we're, it's not going to fall in or something if it's built.|sd
Yeah,|b
oh.|b
But, uh, I have heard that your approach is, is right,|sd
you can actually go out and sub it, if, even if you don't want to get hands on,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things|sd
and, and that's kind of the plan I have|sd
so,|%
Yeah.|b
everyone I talk to, uh, I file in my little book and do other things with it .|sd
That's great,|^q
that's great.|^q
But, uh, like I said otherwise, you know, a-, the expense, -|sd
but, you know, we could not have one as large as we have if, you know, we hadn't did it ourselves.|sd
Sure,|b
I can imagine.|ba
Yeah,|b
I mean it's not an Eldorado house or anything like that,|sd
but, you know, it's ours.|sd
If your happy with it, that's all that counts.|sv
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
That's all,|sv
on-, you only have to, uh, satisfy yourself and no one else.|sv
Ap-, apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high|sv
Oh, that's, uh, that's, uh, an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell, I guess.|sv
Isn't it?|qy
It really is|sv
because I, I'm always shocked at about, you know, what they have it appraised at,|sd
I think, oh my goodness.|sd
Well that's great.|ba
Well, yeah,|%
I guess that about does it.|sv
Okay,|aa
and it was nice talking to you.|fc
Nice talking with you, too.|fc
Okay,|fc
bye-bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I think we're supposed to discuss our view of the Soviet Union as a continuing threat to the United States.|sv
Okay.|b
How do you feel about that.|qo
I don't really, -|%
I more, -|%
I don't know about the government as much as, uh, -|sd
the people, uh, I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all|sd
and I really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore.|sv
I'm, I'm worried about them.|sd
They're in a very, uh, tumultuous state right now with the kinds of, uh, adaptations that they're attempting to go through, uh.|sv
I'm concerned about them not as a military threat, but as a burden.|sd
They're very large --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and they can become very quickly a large financial burden, as, as one more stepchild we have to carry around.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I think that's, that's a real important aspect|sv
and that, uh, as the, the mo-, the most, the mo-, -|%
let's see, the more that we do, that we do or that we can do to help them become self-sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming, uh, you know, a reality.|sv
I know that, uh, this last winter was very hard on, uh, several areas in the, in the, the Ukraine, particularly the coal mining regions of Siberia, uh,|sv
the people there have money,|sv
that's not their problem,|sv
but there's no food for them to buy,|sd
and its, -|%
you can't eat money.|sd
And they have, a, a problem, their, their whole attitude, uh,|sv
I, I'm not sure which crop it was,|sd
but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it.|sd
Yeah.|b
And the people in the city were saying, well why should I go do that. Make the government do that, that's not my job.|sd
Right,|b
they've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they've been through now,|sv
and, uh, they've been, they've been under, under the oppression that they've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms|sv
but they don't know how to act yet.|sv
They don't understand that to make that work,|sv
they've got to take some responsibility for themselves.|sv
It's not just the government's responsibility anymore.|sv
You can't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well.|sv
Absolutely,|aa
and, and I think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back.|sv
People only go forward|sv
and I think that that is giving them, -|sv
I'm expecting a call|sd
and unfortunately, I think it's come through.|sv
I've enjoyed talking to you.|fc
Okay.|b
Thank you,|ft
bye,|fc
All right,|fc
bye-bye.|fc
Real problem the last few days, one of their, uh, young hopeless stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
it was a catcher.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they really don't have an excess of catchers|sv
and it's really kind of, kind of late to, you know, to start, be trying to trade for somebody, especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have.|sv
Yeah.|b
They're not the highest paying ball team around.|sd
Oh no,|aa
no,|aa
they're not, are they.|qy
But I, you know, I would, I would gladly take the salary of most of the guys, I'll tell you.|sd
Oh, goodness,|ba
I would too,|sd
even the bench warmer, I would.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's right.|aa
I really haven't been an active Ranger fan in several years.|sd
I used to go, take my son, you know,|sd
when he was in high school, he enjoyed going to baseball games.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I'll have to admit I kind, I kind of went more to see, to see the other team a lot of times than I did the, did the Rangers,|sd
Uh, yeah.|b
But, I think they're doing better.|sv
Well, I do to, uh,|aa
I have boys, you know, like eight and eleven|sd
and we go quite often,|sd
Yeah,|b
I can imagine.|ba
I used to love to play baseball when I was a kid.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh yes,|aa
we're heavy into that too.|sd
I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch.|sv
Oh, I do too.|aa
Yeah.|b
And I think, uh, what caught so many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan, you know,|sv
yes.|%
Oh of course,|aa
of course.|aa
As a matter of fact I read in the sports page this morning,|sd
he just pitched his first, uh, exhibition game a day or so ago,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and he pitched five, uh, yeah, five full innings.|sd
That was almost unheard of for a pitcher to, you know, to start out that strong.|sd
Yeah,|b
yes,|b
uh-huh.|b
no big deal, you know,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
it's just part of a day's work.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yeah,|aa
I know it,|sv
yeah,|%
yeah.|%
He's something else,|sv
he really is.|sv
He really is an, you know, -|sv
as far as predictions and stuff, I really think the Rangers may come out real strong this year.|sv
They could do very well,|sv
they sure could.|sv
They coul-, because -|%
I don't know|h
but last year I just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh,|b
right.|b
I really do.|sd
Yeah,|b
they've got, uh, I guess all, -|%
well all their players are signed now.|sd
Some of them are not too happy about it|sv
but there, there's no hold outs.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah|b
at least,|sv
So that should help.|sv
it sure should.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it should, uh-huh.|sv
But in a way, I really do,|%
and of course, there's a few more, you know, I think are good ball teams also.|sd
Oh yeah,|aa
sure.|aa
Like Oakland A's and the Giants|sv
I really do.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Sure,|b
sure,|b
uh-huh,|b
Cincinnati.|sv
Yeah,|%
there sure are.|sd
I like to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston some times.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh,|b
that's right.|b
But, uh, -|%
I've never seen the Astros play.|sd
Oh you haven't?|bh
Huh-uh.|nn
Oh, I have a few times.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, they're a good ball team.|sv
That's right.|aa
They really are.|sv
They sure are.|aa
Wouldn't it be something to have a World Series between Da-, the Rangers and the Astros.|qy
Oh, wouldn't it, wouldn't it though|qh
Boy,|ba
I tell you that would draw a crowd, wouldn't it.|sv
Wouldn't it.|qh
It sure would.|sv
Oh my goodness,|ba
we might actually get to go to a World Series, huh.|qy
That's right,|na
wouldn't that be something.|qy
Oh, yeah.|ny
It sure would.|sv
That's something you dream about.|sv
Absolutely.|aa
But there are a lot of Ranger fans around.|sv
Oh, there sure is|aa
and, uh, that, I mean they really are.|sv
Uh, now Incavalia I don't know how familiar you are with him|qy^d
but, last year I was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump.|sv
Yeah.|b
But they're saying this year, their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
Uh-huh,|b
boy,|ba
he's a bull, isn't he?|qy
Isn't he though,|qh
He really is gosh.|sv
he sure is.|sv
He either hits home run or strike out.|sd
Uh-huh,|aa
that's right.|aa
There is not ever a in between for him.|sd
That's right,|aa
it's kind of like Babe Ruth.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
they were saying something about this may be his last year with the Rangers though.|sd
Apparently I think his contract is up after the end of this year|sv
and they're not sure they're going to be able to sign him again.|sd
To sign him again,|sd
yeah.|%
Huh.|%
Yeah,|b
that, you know, may or may not happen.|sd
Yeah,|b
oh you never know.|sv
That's right,|aa
it's a long way away.|sv
That's sure ri-,|%
if you offer them money, I'm sure they'll,|sv
That's right.|aa
That's right,|aa
unfortunately the Rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do.|sv
No,|aa
no,|aa
no, like that Joe Hosago you know.|%
Yeah,|aa
that's right.|aa
I mean, oh. -|%
Is there going to be a ticket increase this year, price, do you know.|qy
I hadn't heard.|no
I haven't either,|sd
I, I really haven't, uh,|sd
The, uh, those Cowboys have increased their prices again this year.|sd
Oh yeah.|b
But I didn't know,|sd
I, I don't think I've heard anything on the Rangers,|sd
or I don't remember it if I have.|sd
Well I hadn't either,|sd
Yeah.|b
We hadn't, you know,|%
like I said, we, -|%
I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet.|sv
Yeah,|b
I guess it's too early.|sv
Yeah,|b
because we usually get one.|sd
We usually order our tickets way in advance.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
it's a good idea,|sv
yeah.|%
We, we try to go so often.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah|b
if you have young, young children, you know, they, they get a kick out of it.|sv
Oh, they do.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I've enjoyed talking to you.|fc
Well you too Lori|fc
And, we'll hopefully we'll get to talk again.|fc
Right,|b
you take care.|fc
Okay,|b
bye-bye.|fc
Okay,|b
bye-bye.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
so I think, I think what we should talk about is, uh, the war.|sv
Okay.|b
The war that just went on.|sd
See, I, I don't agree with it.|sv
First of all I don't believe in war.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And then, the United States has this attitude by saying, you know, thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that.|sv
And I think it's all independent because, it's, it has nothing to do with the United States.|sv
You didn't gain anything from it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And it wasn't our freedom that you were saving.|sv
It was just, -|%
the thing, the thing that, that, that I saw was okay,|sd
Iraq wants to raise oil prices.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And so, when Iraq, you know, saw this, they said let's take over the country, which is a good idea,|sd
right?|^g
Uh-huh.|ny
Then the United States says, okay, our, our oil prices are going to go up.|sd
And like for example, see, okay, like Lith-, Lithuania right, they declared themselves an independent country with a president,|sd
right.|^g
Uh-huh.|ny
Russia goes in there, well the main government in Moscow goes in there|sd
and they kick everybody's ass.|sd
And the United States doesn't go in there|sd
and say, listen, they were, you know, named an independent, you know, state with a president and everything|sd
but we're not going to go into your country.|^q
Uh-huh.|b
But these countries here, which, you know, are, you know, like in NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, -|sv
have you ever read that book?|qy
No,|nn
huh-uh.|nn
Okay,|bk
NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR there are like three big continents|sd
and, uh, there's just this area, like around Egypt and stuff,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Now the problem is, is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right,|b
like their immediate boundaries. Like you're not going to go, you know, it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're, you're invading their border,|sd
right.|^g
Uh-huh.|ny
But all the other countries, you can fight about.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so the thing is, is that you're wasting so much money to send, you know, -|sv
it's like how much money did the U S spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being, -|qh
We'll probably never know how much it actually cost.|sv
And you know, it's, it was basically all based on oil because nobody -|sv
actually, like for example, if, uh, let's say if, you know Brazil took over you know, Surinam.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
You know, and, uh, that's something that, that has been, you know, very, -|sv
because, see the thing is, is like every time that I see a war, I see myself on the front line, and on the other side I see myself again, and I've got to shoot myself, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I got to shoot somebody that's got the same family that I do. You know, the same relationships that I do.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And just because I was born here I've got to shoot them down.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
oh, it's never a pleasant thing,|sv
that's true.|aa
And, uh, but at least it was, it was over quick|sd
and there weren't that many deaths.|sd
Yes|aa
that's, -|%
Now the only problem is, is the aftermath,|sv
Yes.|aa
Yes,|aa
that's really unfortunate,|sv
it really is.|sv
I don't know if we stopped too soon,|sd
I don't, I don't, I really don't know what we need to do about that.|sd
Well, the-, there's something that, that the U S did right which is say, say, you know, okay,|sd
let's kick him out of Kuwait, which was our basic goal.|^q
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, now, indirectly let's try to overthrow him, you know.|^q
Uh-huh.|b
And they're not going to do that directly.|sd
But the thing is, is that, they, they didn't go into, into Iraq and say, you know, because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, you can seek, seek asylum here,|^q
Yeah.|b
and you can go there,|^q
but no way are you going to rule ever again.|^q
Uh-huh.|b
I've been hearing some talk too of trying to bring Hussein up on, you know, criminal charges.|sd
I don't know if that will ever happen or not.|h
Well the thing is, is that first of all they got to, they go-, they have to get him.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
which is very difficult to do.|sv
And, and there's no way that you can get them, unless it's by force.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know. And then you can put him on trial.|sd
Obviously, he's not going to turn himself in.|sv
No,|aa
no,|aa
I think, I think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life, but where.|sd
True,|aa
yeah,|%
uh-huh.|%
You know, and so, um, the thing is, is that once you've done something wrong, which is natio-,|sv
and the, there's no way, you know.|sv
Yeah,|aa
true.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
And you know like he sent planes over to, to shoot the people down that were on the border with, uh, tha-, that were on their way to Turkey.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
He had a couple of them bombarded.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
obviously human life means nothing to him.|sv
Huh-uh.|b
But, uh, you know, he's got, uh, millions of dollars,|sd
like,|sv
Oh yeah.|b
That's true.|aa
Past a point it doesn't make any difference.|bf
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|b
that's really, really unfortunate.|sv
It really is.|sv
But it's just, it's just that, uh, you know, i-, you know, like the, -|%
we just put our goals in different, you know, levels is|sv
like saying, you know, it's like -|%
yeah,|sv
sure,|sv
we need oil, you know,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we need it desperately.|sd
Yeah.|b
But the other countries, that, you know, that have oil but not as big, you know, like they say, you know, like when the prices went up and then they went down.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
When they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally, though, before, before the increase started.|sv
Well, th-, it, its an advantage.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, it's like you're saying, okay, I can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon and I'm not going to bring them back down to, you know, ninety-nine cents.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Why,|qh
because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon,|sv
so if I di-, leave it at a dollar ten, people are still going to pay.|sv
True.|aa
You know, I went down forty cents,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but I went up ten cents.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b^m
About the lowest I've seen gasoline in the Dallas area is, uh, I guess, about ninety-two point nine now.|sd
Ninety-eight?|br
Ninety-two.|sd
Oh, God.|ba
Here it's like, it's like a dollar five.|sd
Oh really.|b
Yeah.|b
Well there's still a lot of dollar five places here|sd
but you can find some that's under a dollar, but not, not a whole lot.|sd
That's the lowest I've seen.|sd
But still the, -|%
I mean, have you ever checked, like, uh, the most money-makers in, uh, in nineteen, uh, ninety.|qy
Uh, you can see that, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
and that was just because of, of the last quarter.|sd
Right,|b
I think Mobil was doing very well, too.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well als-, I, I assume all the major, major brands are.|sd
And, uh, that was, -|%
I mean and what other companies are, went up four hundred and some percent.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And that's practically impossible to do now a days, for a company to,|sv
That's true.|aa
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
that's true.|sv
And, uh, it's just that, you know, people, people take advantage of that.|sv
You know, like the, the companies are saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when, you know, when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for, we've got to raise our prices.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, but still if you realize that, uh, one barrel has like, how much was it, like, um forty gallons,|sd
Yeah,|aa
something like, -|h
yeah.|%
it's got forty gallons|sd
and they're selling, you know, you know, -|sd
you got to pay forty dollars at least and,|sd
Yeah.|b
and it's, it was selling like at twenty-five or something.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So you're making, uh, you know, fifteen dollars profit, easily.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
sure.|b
And, uh, everything, -|%
I mean, and, and, the expenses, you know, of the war, you know, it's like, uh, it's like who's gaining on this.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Okay,|b
because, uh, i-, does, does the U S government own any gas companies, like, like, you know gas stations and stuff?|qh
Uh-huh.|b
I, because, see like for example, I don't know if the British government owns Shell.|sd
I'm not sure about that.|sd
I'm not sure either.|sd
But the thing is like the U S government got nothing out of it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, then the taxes go up|sd
and then everybody else loses.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, um, you know, they're just, they're just some things that might not be worth it.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|sv
You know, and, and first of all how many, how many people had to, had to die before the war, you know,|qh
it's like transporting stuff and things like that,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
yeah|%
sure, you know, like to, to a couple people that died there, their families don't feel it was necessary to do that.|sv
Sure,|aa
dead's dead.|bf
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
you, you could, you could never bring them back.|sd
That's true,|aa
so. -|%
Oh well. -|b
Well, I don't guess we resolved anything|sv
but it's interesting.|sv
Yeah,|b
so, okay,|%
nice talking to you.|fc
To you too,|fc
take care.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
All right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I, I think our experience of camping is, -|sv
I, I am the, the passive member,|sd
I get things ready and then I enjoy.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, because, my, my husband is a good camper|sd
and so they, -|%
he manages the troops|sd
and they do the work|sd
and I have fun|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, uh, uh, your, you said your family was gro-, uh, all grown up now,|sd
how about when they were younger,|qo
did you go cam-, take them camping?|qy
That's when we camped the most.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
When, -|%
I thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because, uh,|sv
and, and getting out into nature and relaxing,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and the part that I did was more fun than, uh, than labor because they did the, the running and toting chores and I just helped cook and kind of organize, you know.|sd
Yeah|b
bu-, e-, even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun, isn't it.|qy
It is,|na
isn't it.|^g
It isn't.|ng
Ha-, what kinds of things have you tried?|qw
Have you done, uh, uh, uh, the big pot cooking?|qy
Oh, oh, uh, well, it was really my ex who did the, the, uh, uh, the cooking back when we first started|no
and we found that the, you know, what was one, one great handy things was this, uh, uh, uh, hamburger helper.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Big frying p-,|sd
you dumped everything in together|sd
and it was enough for all five of us, six of us.|sd
Oh, that's interesting.|ba
You know, interesting enough, uh, the food part was kind of, uh, important thing in our camping.|sd
Uh, when my oldest son, uh, -|sd
always at the beginning I did all the shopping and everything.|sd
But the, the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his, uh, uh, cooking merit badge in,|sd
and, and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff|sd
and, uh,|sd
Oh.|b
And so, uh, after he took that merit badge, he did all the shopping and preparing, getting ready for it.|sd
Well that's great.|ba
It was, it was a marvelous experience because after that, then all I had to do was, uh, follow the instructions, you know and do.|sd
And we did a lot of interesting kinds of things|sd
like I would take corn bread and, uh, cook a pan inside of a pan over a, over a camp, uh, stove.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it works real good.|sd
It's like an oven.|sd
Well,|sd
Just put, uh, put a thing on it.|ad
I mean. -|h
What did you like to do most?|qw
Well really just commune with nature.|sd
That's neat isn't it?|qy
We started out, uh, -|sd
well we were living in Florida at the time|sd
and we, early in life, we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very, very expensive.|sd
Right.|aa
I agree.|sd
So my ex decided, we're going to try camping|sd
and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent.|sd
And that's how we got started.|sd
Huh.|b
We did it for years and years, uh.|sd
Well now in Florida, is ther-, is there ti-, are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot.|qy
Well, ye-, uh,|arp_nd
yes and no.|no
I mean, um, ye-, in the winter time yes,|sd
it's, it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, there's really no time of the year that you can't go.|sd
Oh, is that true?|qy
Uh, becau-, -|%
Now, now we're, we're in Texas now|sd
and you're in Texas,|qy^d
right.|^g
Yes,|ny
I'm in Dallas.|sd
Okay, uh,|bk
we have not camped a great deal here because, uh, a good share of the time in the Summer time, it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping.|sd
Well, it just depends on where you go,|sd
for instance,|sv
I gue-, -|%
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
we have done that|sd
But, but we camped mostly, -|sd
when the kids were little we were in, we were in New Jersey, and w-,|sd
it's just about twelve miles south of, the New York border.|sd
And we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp|sd
and it was so, you know, pick your own, uh, blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast|sd
Oh yes,|aa
yes,|aa
ye-,|%
Uh, also, -|%
I co-,|sd
go ahead. -|ad
I'm a New Yorker myself.|sd
Oh, are you?|bh
Where did you live?|qw
A little town called Tuckaho, over by White Plains.|sd
Oh, oh yeah,|b
I know that.|sd
I had a cousin who lived in White Plains,|sd
that's a, that's a neat area.|sv
But it's a, that is a particularly neat area for camping because, -|sv
Well that I wouldn't know|sd
I left there when I was quite young.|sd
Yeah,|b
it is neat though because there are lots of lakes, fairly near by,|sv
you don't have to go very far.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, and there's, uh, a lot of trees, lot of mountains, and lot of, uh, hiking sort of things|sd
and, and we had, uh, collapsible boat which we, clipper, little clipper sail boat.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so we would sail and, and, uh, did a lot of camping that way.|sd
Well, uh, me, I outgrew, uh, sleeping bags and, uh, tents, -|sd
and I now have a motor home.|sd
Oh, do you.|bh
We've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis|sd
and it's fun, too, I think.|sv
Well I live in mine.|sd
Do you?|bh
Yes.|ny
That's neat,|sv
so you kind of, uh, uh, an everyday camper|qy^d

You and your dog, huh,|bf
Yeah.|aa
Hey,|ba
that sounds great.|ba
Well, we don't, we don't camp quite as much as we used to,|sd
but, uh, I still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family,|sv
Oh yes,|aa
definitely.|aa
I'd always, -|%
Nothing like the fresh outdoors.|bf
right,|aa
I'd always come home just relaxed and, uh, comfortable and ready to go at it again,|sd
so it was a neat activity.|sv
Good to talk to you.|fc
Tell me your name again.|ad

Jack,|b^m
Uh-huh.|b
all right.|bk
Are you, uh, from Dallas too, Beth.|qy
Ye-, yes,|ny
we've been here,|sd
we're, we're in Plano,|sd
Oh!|ba
but we've been here about, uh, eighteen years.|sd
Well that's where we, that's where I am,|sd
Plano.|sd
Are you, are you, -|qy
how about that.|ba
Well we're all, lots of people from T I up this way.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
All right,|fc
good to talk to you.|fc
Nice talking to you too, Beth.|fc
All right,|fc
all right,|fc
bye-bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
how do you feel about them?|qo
Well, I keep trying to get away from them,|sd
I used to use a lot of credit cards|sd
I guess for a while I would use, you know, a variety of the Visa and the MasterCard and the stores,|sd
but I think I, I impulse buy too much with them|sv
or I buy things, you know, I see it on sale|sd
and I think, oh, it's on sale I have to get it,|sd
and I really don't need it|sv
or I really haven't budgeted for it|sd
so, um, the last couple of years I really have tried not to use them at all.|sd
Yeah.|b
What about you?|qo
Well, we have this philosophy, we use it when we go off somewhere|sd
but we pay for it as soon as we come back, you know,|sd
as soon as we get our bills,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And we only have one.|sd
We tore all the rest of them up.|sd
okay.|b
Because I don't like credit cards for one thing, you know, -|sd
I mean, they're okay, I guess,|h
if you're on a trip or something,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
but I don't like using them because I've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on,|sd
Huh.|%
Uh-huh.|b
Because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card, you don't have to pay for it.|sv
That's true|aa
if, if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket.|bf
Sometimes you may think, well, I don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
and it gives you a, sens-, um, a false sense of security or something it seems like|sv
because you say, oh, well, I don't have to pay for it now|sd
but you're going to have to pay for it,|sd
and it seems like ... -|sv
Yeah,|aa
you think, well, I don't have it now but payday will come and then I'll have the money.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time,|sv
Right.|b
Are you married?|qy
Yes.|ny
Oh, okay.|bk
Well, I know that a lot of young people, you know, I, -|sd
it took me a long time to get it through my child's head,|sd
I mean, that was her goal, you know, uh, got to have a credit card,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but now that she has one,|sd
she's only used it one time|sd
but she wanted to establish some credit,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but I think it finally sunk in, you know, because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say, you know, well, I used a credit card.|sv
And my husband's sister is the world's worst at, oh, -|sv
well, I'll just use the credit cards|^q
and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit.|sd
Huh.|%
You know, and I'm, I'm thinking woman, wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you.|sd
But ... -|%
Right.|b
Besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this ... -|sd
Right,|aa
and people don't see that either.|sd
Yeah,|b
this thing that you thought you got on sale, by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time,|sd
you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing.|sd
Right.|b
The only one that we, we have that we kept was the Discover card,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it pays you to use it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any, uh, interest.|sd
Now it's, -|%
and people say, well, you know, I'm making money by using this credit card,|sd
but they don't realize that if they, -|sv
I mean, it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest,|sd
I mean, you have to pay the interest, not pay it right off,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
that's going to take up what you would have made.|sd
Huh.|%
So that's the only reason that we kept that,|sd
we debated for a long time|sd
plus they don't have that, um, charge on it, you know,|sd
like ... -|%
Service charge you mean?|br
Yeah.|ny
Yearly fee,|bf
yeah.|%
Right.|aa
They don't have one of those.|sd
So, it, -|%
we decided that was it, you know,|sd
and, I mean, everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card.|sd
We have, we could have credit cards running down our ears.|sd
Oh, you get that stuff in the mail all the time.|sd
Yes,|aa
yes.|aa
And then, I-, I'll have, just like , uh, department stores.|sd
They'll call me up, you know,|sd
and I'll say,|sd
look, I don't want the credit card,|^q
well, we're just going to send it to you, you know,|^q
you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to.|^q
They'll send me any credit card,|sd
I tear it up.|sd
I just can't see it.|sv
What I really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that I do have still,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
and they say, hey, you know, two thousand dollars, you know, free to you kind of thing, you know,|sd
all you got to do is go cash those things|sd
and you've got a short term loan.|sd
I hate it,|sd
I know it,|sd
and you know what ... -|%
I can't believe they have the nerve to do that.|sd
What's really bad about those though is just like -|sv
young people if they don't, you know, -|sd
we take the time to, you know, help my daughter,|sd
she's in college,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it, this is her first credit card thing,|sd
well, when she got her first one she was so excited|sd
it was unreal.|sv
Look at this they sent me this money, you know.|^q
So then when I explained to her, look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest, and stuff ,|sd
of course, she ter-, tore it up.|sd
But a lot of parents would not take the time, you know,|sv
and they wouldn't even think of it|sv
or their kids may not be as close as my daughter|sv
and I -|%
are, -|%
and, uh, you know, they may not even discuss it,|sv
they go out and cash their check thinking that, you know,|sd
they've got something,|sd
maybe they've won something.|sd
You know, somebody sent them something free.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And go out and spend it.|sd
And, um, it's just unreal.|sv
I mean, I don't like credit cards,|sd
I wish that they would come up with some other way to, you know,|sv
the only way you could use them is if you were, like on vacation.|sd
They would let you use it maybe once a year.|sd
You know, I mean, of course, I guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time|sv
but, um, I have seen so many people|sd
and I have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen.|sd
She got, uh, -|sd
I can't remember what she called it,|sd
it's some kind of, -|sd
maybe it's sure or something like that,|sv
it's something, it's some weird name of a credit card,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and she is charging out of her mind already.|sd
And I'm going, -|sd
you just got off.|^q
That's how you got on to it to start with, you know, what is the matter with this person,|^q
Yeah.|b
But, um, it seems like people just, you know, they just think, well, I can just have anything I want.|sv
And I just don't see it like that.|sv
Of course, I always see pay the bills first|sd
and whatever's leftover, that's what you have,|sd
but, um, maybe a lot of people don't see it like that,|sv
but I can't stand owing.|sd
I mean, I cannot fully tolerate to owe something like, you know, -|sd
I guess it's just because I've been brought up like that.|sv
But, um, I could not charge to the limit and knowing that I was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to payout.|sd
But, that's just the way I feel about it.|h
Yeah,|b
I think it's, it's somewhat a, uh, symptom of our, me generation|sv
and that, -|%
we think we need all these things|sv
and I think my parents always, you know, did without or saved up to, you know, buy things|sv
and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have, you know, -|sv
like when I first got my apartment and I was setting it up I did try to economize some|sd
but, you know, I was just like, well, I have to have it all furnished and I have to have all of my kitchen setup|sd
and you don't, you know, do without too much|sd
and, you know, that's how I got started kind of with setting up a household all up, you know, it kind of like, in the short amount of time.|sd
You know, you just have to have these things just, you know, have them at home, have to have them at my own place|sv
and that's, you know, a big expenditure to start, um, buying all these things that you think or, or have to have|sv
and actually they're kind of luxuries|sv
or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place,|sv
Right.|b
yeah.|b
But we're not into that.|sv
We're into like, have to have it all now.|sv
oh, yeah.|b
I guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that.|sv
But, um, I guess it's because I'm older,|sv
I mean, I'm not real old|sv
but I am older|sv
and, um, you know, I didn't feel like that I didn't feel like I had to have everything.|sd
I guess it was because, -|sv
well, I had everything when I was at home|sd
but I, I don't know why I didn't.|sd
Well, we're geared to that.|sv
We're like, -|sd
okay,|^q
like I want a living room set. And instead of sitting back and, and going, okay, well, it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars, two thousand dollars|sd
and I'll save for two years,|^q
uh-huh.|b
people go, oh, well, I'll just go buy it, put it on credit and they'll pay it off.|sd
yeah.|b
People aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it,|sv
they just put it on a charge card, put it on account,|sv
Huh.|%
It's always have to have it now.|sv
Yeah,|b
well, it didn't hurt you, did it, to, -|qy
I mean, you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything, did you?|qy
no,|nn
no,|nn
but I have had some times when I've had some pretty good balances on there|sd
and, uh, you know, I finally, you know, paid them all off and thought this is, you know, kind of nonsense.|sd
So, we don't, uh, have big balances on them at,|sd
all now we're, we're, you know, we, -|%
I use it occasionally|sd
but I pay it right off.|sd
We're ... -|%
Yeah,|b
well, you learned then,|sv
right?|^g
Yeah,|ny
you learn the, you know, the hard way, you hate paying all that interest|sd
and I've never been one to itemize on my income, tax and never had enough to itemize|sd
and so it's just a big chunk of money|sd
and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying, so much more for that item, because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what, forty dollars sometimes just to have the card.|sv
Yeah.|b
That's, a lot of money that you went to buy this item.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And then you never feel like you've got anything to p-, to put into savings or anything,|sv
you're always just paying bills, paying bills, you know,|sv
you don't feel that you have any extra to save.|sv
And I hate, I hate living paycheck to paycheck.|sd
I like to have a little there, you know,|sd
that I can, save|sd
so I can feel that, you know, if something comes up I've got the money to pay for it, .|sd
Jay, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
my kids are, are both in college, um,|sd
and I'd, I played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go.|sd
On the other hand, they really decided themselves.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, what, what kind of experience did you have?|qo
Well, I, uh, -|%
one girl went in, in state and has graduated,|sd
and then, uh, that was, uh, you know, that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I have, uh, one, out of, two out of state, both in Missouri,|sd
and, um, I teach, uh, in a college,|sd
and so I they had heard me talk about it, and for years, that I didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate.|sd
Uh, so, that was --|%
Um.|%
I see,|b
well, I, may, maybe I'm wrong,|h
but I think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and,|sv
Oh, oh, if they, if they're content there,|^2
I mean as far as the education, as far as looking at the degree at the end, that, uh, it's very little difference is paid --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, if it's a halfway decent school --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and if they can get, uh, um, two out of, -|sd
let's see, my son got a full total scholarships --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so there's, uh, there's plenty of scholarships out there,|sv
and so people should be advised to look for those,|sv
and, um, -|%
Did, did you play a, a strong role in helping them pick schools|qy
or --|qrr
Uh.|%
and, -|%
Well, they, uh, -|^h
I went, we went around,|sd
my son was a, graduated from a Jesuit high school --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so he, he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university,|sd
and so there --|%
Uh-huh.|b
that was limited to five or six different places|sd
and, um, so he's in Saint Louis U,|sd
and I guess I played a role in that.|sv
I, I just sort of, uh, let them, um, you know, -|sd
they'd all been, uh --|sd
Yeah.|b
and, uh, so I didn't have that much to do,|sd
they just, uh --|sd
Yeah.|b
and I, you know, helped them get there as far as --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
We did do that,|sd
and I would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up.|sd
Yeah,|b
I think that's a great idea,|sv
I mean, that, -|%
Some people don't do it,|sv
and then they get there and hate it, or whatever,|sv
so --|sd
Right.|b
It's, it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it, but, but the --|sv
Right.|b
I think in the short run it is expensive.|sv
In the long run it's very, uh, reasonable --|sv
Yeah.|b
my daughter has been in, in Missouri for a second year,|sd
now she's coming home at the end of the semester --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so, uh, you know, she's already twenty-one.|sd
She started late.|sd
So that's, you know, strictly up to her,|sd
and, uh, she'll finish down here, uh, uh, finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year.|sd
Yeah.|b
It'll save me a lot of money because I'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- but again, that's her decision --|sd
Right.|b
-- so, uh, but I have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back,|sd
and they're much better students at twenty-five, twenty-six, may, twenty-eight.|sv
So, you know, I don't, I never have pushed them.|sd
I just say that education is important, you should do it, uh,|sd
but, uh, they have to do the work --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- so, uh. -|%
Yeah,|b
well, back, back to this visiting thing,|ad
I mean, I found that my kids had no conception what college was really like --|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
-- and being able to go with them to so-, at least some of them --|sd
Oh, I think so.|aa
And also I'm opposed to the, to the size.|sv
They've just gotten so huge,|sv
and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand,|sd
see that's just too many.|sv
Good grief|ba
Ended up going to where I used to go,|sd
and that was twenty-five hundred when I went there,|sd
it's twenty-one thousand, now|sd
it's too big.|sv
Good grief.|ba
So, -|%
What is twenty-one thousand?|qw
Pardon?|br
What school is that?|qw
It's Southwest Missouri State University --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, it was twenty-five hundred when I went there forty years ago,|sd
and, uh, my son's in a school about seven thousand,|sd
and that's, that's not bad --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- I teach in a school about eight thousand,|sd
and that's, that's even a little large --|sv
Yes.|aa
-- but it's much better than twenty-one thousand.|sv
But they do have to visit, and if, if the parent can point out all the different places to look for --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and then, oh, those rating, uh, -|sd
the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything,|sd
I don't think it hurts to look at them --|sv
Yes.|aa
-- I don't put that much stock in them,|sv
but -- -|%
Uh-huh.|b
-- probably fine just to compare.|sv
Helps to at least set up --|bf
Right.|b
If they, you know, uh, they need to, -|sv
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
who do you like?|qw
Okay,|b
What kind do I like?|qw
I like just about any kind except country and western.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's the same with me, same with me.|sd
It's, it's, course country|sv
and western even I've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Like Clint Black, he's pretty good,|sv
and who's the other big guy?|qw
Well, in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks|sd
Garth Brooks,|b^m
yeah,|bk
that's, yeah, that's the other guy I was thinking of was Garth Brooks.|sd
Yeah,|%
in fact I think both of them have performed here.|sd
And Kenny Rogers, he's kind of country western verge, you know --|sv
Right.|b
Of course, Garth Brooks lives about, uh, you know, -|sd
his, his home town is about, uh, fifteen minutes away --|sd
Oh, wonderful.|ba
-- so he is, he's a home boy|sd
Well, then, of course you like him.|sv
That's great.|ba
But, well, I have teen age children,|sd
and so, you know, I'm, hear the, the rock music, not the hard rock, but the, you know, Michael Bolton type stuff.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
He's my personal favorite.|sd
My son is, uh, twenty-eight,|sd
so, but he, he's real unusual in that, uh,|sd
he likes a little bit of every kind.|sd
He likes jazz --|sd
Oh, that's good.|ba
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
-- I, I can't say he's real crazy about elevator music, as he calls it.|sd
No,|b
no,|b
I, I don't, I don't, actually, we don't listen to any elevator music at my house.|sd
But I've got teenagers,|sd
so. -|%
Well, my teenagers are all gone.|sd
I can listen to any music I want to|sd
Yeah,|b
that's good,|ba
I, actually, when I'm home alone, which isn't too often, but, uh, our Public Radio Station has wonderful classical music.|sd
It's just very wonderful. Soothing, and, you know, uh, lot of symphonies|sv
and, I just, I love that,|sd
that's probably my all-time favorite.|sd
You know, uh, I, I teach --|sd
Um.|%
-- and we can have music in the classroom,|sd
but it, you know, it can't be the rock or anything like that --|sd
Right.|b
-- and I, I find that the classical music is very good for the kids too, it doesn't disturb them and --|sv
Right.|b
Relax,|^2
and --|%
Yeah.|b
What do you teach, what grade?|qw
Well, it's ninth, nine through twelve --|sd
Good for you.|ba
-- and, -|%
A certain subject?|qw^d
Well, it's, uh, business technology.|sd
Good for you.|ba
But, uh -- -|%
I was just sitting here while she was trying to find, a, a, another caller, uh,|sd
I was reading -|sd
my, my husband and I are taking a computer class at our junior college|sd
-- oh, boy,|ba
Yeah,|b
it's pretty good,|sv
it's just a real basic class,|sd
but we're learning a lot,|sd
and we have a home computer,|sd
so it's, it's very interesting.|sv
Uh, yeah,|b
I'd learn it too.|sd
Uh, back to, I guess we'd better get back to music, though.|sv
Yeah,|b
the subject of music|sd
I, uh, -|%
do you play any instruments?|qy
I play, I play piano,|na
I took lessons for thirteen years,|sd
and right now my nine year old is taking piano,|sd
and I just got a whole mess of music,|sd
I, I play the, volunteer to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the whole grade school, which is K through six --|sd
Ooh, you took on a, -|sv
good job.|ba
I did it last year,|sd
and, and, um, I, I just sub at the school,|sd
I don't want to work full time,|sd
so I just sub at the school,|sd
and that's kind of my volunteer thing,|sd
so that, it, it's really neat,|sv
and my older daughter plays the saxophone,|sd
my next son plays the drums,|sd
and my third son just started baritone this year,|sd
and my little girl will start French horn next year,|sd
so. -|%
Oh, well, my son played the sax and drums, my daughter the piano, organ and French horn.|sd
Oh.|b
So. -|%
French horn is absolutely wonderful instrument.|sv
It's just my favorite.|sd
Of course that's what I played,|sd
and so I'm pushing that on my daughter because I want to play in our city band, not the symphony, with just the city band --|sd
Oh, okay.|b
and I get a little bit more time.|sd
Right now I'm busy chasing my kids.|sd
Yes,|b
sounds like you've got a houseful.|qy^d
I do, I do, I love it,|na
but we have a, a marvelous band instructor,|sv
and, and he's just, he's wonderful.|sv
We have, uh, couple of hundred kids in the band,|sd
our junior high band is just wonderful.|sv
Oh, that's a, -|%
He, lot, -|%

and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in,|sd
and my son will be in next year|sd
that's, -|%
I mean, they ca-, play college level music in junior high,|sd
he's that good of an instructor,|sv

Oh, that's wonderful,|ba
So it's really good.|sv
It is wonderful.|sv
I, I have totally, totally a tin ear --|sd

Oh, I guess, uh, this is a, a topic near and dear to my heart,|sd
Well, I, I try to be as well,|sd
Well, I'm not, uh, I, -|%
there really isn't any kind of particular food that I, I don't, don't like really,|sd
and I like a good Italian restaurant --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
especially like good prime rib --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so if it's, uh, nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that,|sv
and I live here in, uh, Rome, New York,|sd

Oh, you're in New York,|sd
I was going to, -|sd
there's a place, if you ever make it to Dallas --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's seasoning salt --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and it is absolutely wonderful.|sv
Really.|b
And, uh, we were there a few months ago,|sd
and it, I mean, it's kind of pricey,|sv
well, from New York it probably doesn't matter,|sv
but -|%
Oh, no,|ar
I'm in upstate New York,|sd

I, -|%
there's a --|sd
Oh, is it, okay.|ba
Wow.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
so that, -|%
Yeah,|b
well, I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen,|sd

but --|sv
Right.|b
It's the best I have ever had.|sd
Uh, I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had,|sd
so,|sd
Yeah|b
Well, -|%

well, we like, uh, lots of people down here like Mexican food --|sv

No,|b
no,|b
I'm not into the, the, don't do the, the raw, raw fish like that,|sd
but I do like, uh, like a seafood bar, like a raw, raw bar like oysters and things like that, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- that they, uh, -|%
I go on, -|sd
I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business --|sd
Oh, okay.|b
-- so I, uh, find myself down in Melbourne, Florida about once, once a month, once every two months or so --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, yeah --|b
-- but, I love that,|sd
-- fresh seafood down there,|^2
Yeah,|aa
and, um, and, uh, Maryland's great,|sv
you get the crabs --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- it's like, I can't go anywhere where I --|sd
Yeah|b
so, -|%
Yeah,|b
seafood seems to be a lit-, a little bit more expensive than, than other types of food.|sv
That's true.|aa
But it sure is good,|sv
and it's supposed to be good for you.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, uh, it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so expensive, because when you, in reality, uh, uh, I, say that, uh, the oceans have the greatest re-, resource of food --|sv
Right.|b
and yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically --|sd
Right.|b
-- so, we managed to, uh, figure out how to get at just about everything else, but, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Do you like spicy foods|qy
or, -|%
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
I like, uh, I make a, a wicked chili|sd
and around here the big spicy thing is like, uh, buffalo wings --|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
-- and so, uh, it, people, they, you know, -|sv
you go out to get the chicken wings|sd
and those are really hot --|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Well, we, uh, we like spicy food down here, especially, uh, the hot sauce, Picante sauce, or salsa --|sd
Right.|b
Sure.|b
-- and, uh, we, we sure go through a lot of that|sd
Yeah.|b
But I like it hot,|sd
but I don't like it real hot --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
My, generally my, my scalp will start,|sd
I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot,|sd
but, uh, I don't know,|h
but, uh, -|%
yeah,|%
well, there isn't, isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like.|sd
Yeah.|b
Things that are kind of oddball, like, uh, Thai cuisine,|sv
I never been really fond of that stuff.|sd
You talk about spicy,|sd
that'll, that'll literally blow your head off,|sv
it's so hot.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, and I can handle just about any kind of food without, uh, um, -|sd
well, but that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond, uh,|sd
Uh-huh|b
So. Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the, uh, service in a restaurant is always nice though, too --|sv
Oh, yeah,|b
-- that's one thing,|sd
and the price.|^2
What's that?|br
Yeah,|aa
Well, I find that lately that so many people are working, you know, working waitressing jobs or waiter,|sd
Go ahead.|ad
Um, I haven't given this a, a lot of thought.|sd
I'm, uh, that, that's a whole, pleased with the pr-, practice that is they, -|sd
I, uh, I don't, -|%
you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand that's arguable but that, that, uh, people who's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards.|sv
Uh, I haven't given this matter enough thought.|sd
Do you work for T I?|qy
No, uh,|nn
Oh.|bk
I'm in the Washington area.|sd
I work for N I S T .|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
Oh, all right.|bk
Well, see we have the testing already here.|sd
We've had it for, oh, about five years.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It used to just be for new employees.|sd
And now --|sd
And now, -|b^m
They, uh, randomly select employee numbers|sd
and, uh, the day that they select you is when you have to go and, and be tested.|sd
Okay,|b
and how do people feel about it?|qo
So, we're familiar with it.|sd
Oh, we have a lot of, um, people upset about it at the beginning. Some not all.|sd
But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse. Um, mainly the areas whe-, where they were doing a lot of, um, manufacturing type things|sd
and what they ended up doing is, uh, kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening,|sd
and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing, you know, on the premises.|sd
Well, okay,|b
that's, that's a very different issue.|sv
Well, yeah,|b
it was, you know, combination of, of, uh, both activities and, uh, and using too|sd
so they developed this, uh, drug policy so that, uh, to eliminate, -|sd
there's some parts of the company that we do, uh, government contracts,|sd
and I think some of those require the drug testing,|sv
but now T I thought well, we'll just do it for all employees that, um, not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in|sd
and that we shouldn't have, um, people on drugs within our, you know, offices and such.|^q
And, -|%
I haven't personally ever been tested,|sd
but I don't have a problem with it.|sd
Um, does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs?|qy
No,|nn
but one thing that to, to me was, um, going on, stretching it a little too far was that they also check, um, if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug.|sv
You know, it happens a lot of times|sd
like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever|sd
and, you know --|sd
Well , -|%
Well, according to what they do at T I, if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name.|sd
It, you know, it can't be in your spouse's name|sd
so they will look, I mean, the testing will look for, I guess, any kind of drugs,|sv
and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for.|sd
So they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking?|qy
Right.|na
Yes,|ny
yes.|ny
When you get tested you are supposed to tell them, you know, everything that, that might be there.|sd
And then if they ever, um, question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name.|sd
Okay.|b
Well, it, I mean, it's, I guess that, in fact, they don't test for, for, they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs|sv
but that I, but they don't say in advance , uh,|sd
so, -|%
Well, what they wo-, be testing for are the ones that would have like, you know, barbiturates or codeine things like that in them.|sv
The ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances or something anyway .|bf
Right,|aa
right.|aa
I guess that's what i-, they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and an-, antibiotics and stuff.|sv
They would be looking for the, yeah, controlled things, barbiturates amphetamines.|sv
So what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances.|bf
Right,|aa
right.|aa
You pretty much, you know, put down what you remember even if it was just Contact or something like that.|sd
But afterwards, uh, maybe if you had a controlled substance|sd
Is Contact a,|qy
you, you probably put down, you know, you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it.|sd
Okay.|b
Is Contact a,|qy
No.|nn
I'm,|sd
Okay.|bk
Okay.|b
But if they had a controlled substance, maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name.|sv
I know I had one contract employee through Manpower was not a T I person,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they test them too even if you are not a real, uh, T I -er.|sd
If you are a contract employee here --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And he had taken some kind of, um, oh, you know, uh, -|sd
just, he had some kind of flu or something.|sd
He got a real bad migraine|sd
and he took his mother's, -|sd
All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
What is your favorite show?|qw
Well, I was just trying to think.|^h
When they called, I didn't have as much time to prepare for this as I did some of the others.|sd
Um, I love watching some of the, uh, new, new shows basically.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we, uh, to-, we subscribe to C N N|sd
and we took that,|sd
and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake,|sd
and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this.|sd
The new shows and the stuff that comes on that, that it, you know, -|sd
like the, uh, at night the discussion talk shows and things. -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, uh, especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here.|sd
Sure.|b
We have little ones.|sd
Uh, we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we think that's kind of informative to teach them,|sv
It really is.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
What do you watch?|qw
I watch just about anything,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I mean I'll watch, you know, maybe a little while when I first get home in the evening.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I usually watch, you know, the news|sd
and then I'll watch that HARD COPY or --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's the same thing we do.|sd
and I like the NINE ONE ONE,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
that kind, that's the kind I like really more than,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I haven't gotten,|sd
Now, I do,|sd
my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on, on Monday evening.|sd
I have heard that's real good.|sd
And I,|%
That's,|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Yeah,|b
I've heard that.|sd
And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny.|sd
Now someone told me that|sd
and also, uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, his favorite night is Monday night|sd
so we've got to where we will sit,|sd
You've got to yeah,|bf
Uh-huh.|b
because that and then that, uh, oh, -|%
I can't even think of the name of it.|sd
Like I say I'm not, -|sd
DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night,|sd
Yeah,|b
and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis .|sd
Huh, I don't even know.|sd
Sergeant, uh, MA-, MAJOR DAD.|sd
Oh, okay.|b
Now I,|sd
Yeah,|b
that comes on right after, uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So we always, he watches that|sd
and I kind of s-, I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others,|sd
On the others.|b^m
Well, you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Or, um, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot.|sd
Oh, excuse me just a minute to someone in the|ad
The money is right there on the thing and the coupon.|t3
Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though.|sv
Oh, I know.|aa
That's the thing.|sd
And so,|%
Except they,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, they are.|sd
In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight,|sd
but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off.|sd
Did you get your pizza taken care of?|qy
Yeah,|ny
he has gone to get it.|sd
Thank you|ft
Um, but I was to say on Saturdays there is absolutely nothing|sv
and that's the day my husband,|sd
Well, do you know, -|qy
I have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that I've really liked|sd
and that's SISTERS.|sd
Have you watched that?|qy
No,|nn
but I saw that advertised today|sd
and it sounds like it's not fluff.|sv
It sounds like it's good.|sv
It's really, you know, it's really pretty good.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera I guess.|sv
Yeah,|b
that's what they said it was kind of,|sd
But it's a, -|%
So far it, I've watched it about three times now|sd
and it's really held my attention.|sd
It's been pretty good. Some,|sv
Well, and a-,|sd
and you are wanting to cocoon more,|sv
that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.|sd
Some of these,|sd
Now I watched,|sd
Did you,|qy
but I haven't, -|sd
I did.|na
I liked it.|sd
Did you?|bh
Well, they said that one and I'LL FLY AWAY are really quality, you know|sd
and, -|%
Now I haven't seen I'LL FLY AWAY yet.|sd
I haven't seen it either.|sd
I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's nearly,|bf
Yeah.|aa
That's the way I am.|sd
I get in,|sd
Yeah.|b
and I'm tired|sd
and I sit and watch for a few minutes|sd
so I have to get up and do dinner,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, it's like,|sd
Yeah.|b
That's us.|sd
If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos,|sd
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
well, we do too.|sd
But there are some good shows on.|sv
I, I really probably should watch more of them than I do.|sv
Yeah.|b
But I like, -|sd
I don't know|h
I, I'm always in to making things|sd
and,|sd
I don't know,|h
yeah.|%
There's a lot more to do with,|sv
and I, my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends.|sd
They don't have children yet,|sd
and they just turn it on when they walk in,|sd
they turn it off when they leave.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
So they are used to that too.|sd
I could be around here for hours by myself and never have it on.|sd
Yeah,|b
I understand.|ba
Same here.|sd
But, uh, but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed,|sd
and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's real good.|sv
And then of course, in the afternoons if I get in from work in time I watch OPRAH, some of those,|sd
Yeah.|b
I like her.|sd
I never get in in time for any of those.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b^m
Well, it's, it's nice talking to you.|fc
I guess we've kind of exhausted this one,|fc
but it's nice talking with you.|fc
Well, it's nice talking with you.|fc
Thank you.|fc
Bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Uh, I guess it's, uh, -|%
watching the ra-, the T V today there had a lot of stuff on, on, uh, crime.|sd
In our state right now, uh, recently they've had a lot of, uh, uh, the rapists, uh, murder type, uh, killers going around|sd
and --|%
Oh, gracious.|ba
they've caught them|sd
and they, they're in there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Wasn't it your state that had the, uh, guy that committed all those murders?|qy
There was that, uh, -|sd
Well, yeah,|ny
Wisconsin, uh, and Milwaukee area, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
that was really on the national news a lot.|sd
We heard a lot about that in Texas.|sd
Yeah.|b
So that's, -|%
well, I, I live right on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin|sd
so I kind of get both, both news|sd
and, I know, in Minnesota, uh, they had, uh, the one that just, uh, got out and went after a, uh, college student and raped,|sd
Oh.|b
and they are not too happy about that now, I guess,|sv
so. -|%
Well, I can imagine.|ba
There . -|%
It seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me.|sv
I, I don't know.|h
I don't know if statistically they are|sd
but it seems like you sure hear a, maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news|sv
I don't know.|h
Yeah,|b
uh, that's hard to say for sure.|sd
I, uh, sometimes I wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity|sv
and,|sd
You wonder about that sometimes.|sd
and they become big celebrities.|sd
But, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
That's kind of scary.|sv
I, I wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories.|sv
Maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas.|sv
Well, uh, I know one thin-, I, I think Texas has the death penalty, right?|qy
Yes,|ny
we do.|sd
Yeah.|b
Do you have it up there?|qy
No,|nn
no.|nn
I see.|bk
See I, I no-, i-, -|%
Do you think that's a deterrent?|qy
Yeah,|ny
well, it's, it's, it's not going to prevent any people from doing it|sd
but,|sd
Yeah.|b
And that's, -|%
and there are a lot of repeaters. Uh,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I guess that's another thing that to me is a, a real problem,|sv
and I know we have got so many people in our prison system now, at least here in Texas --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- I mean, they are really in a crisis.|sd
There has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them.|sd
Yeah.|b
And a lot of them they put out on parole|sd
and then some of the ones that they put out early, you know, do repeat offenses|sd
and,|sd
Huh.|%
Yeah.|b
Well, some, I'm just wondering a lot of times they will put, uh, people, lesser crimes in, uh, with, uh, people that did more severe crimes|sv
than they, maybe they just tend to learn from these people|sv
and they, and when they get back out, they just go into worse crimes.|sv
I think that could be true too.|sv
Maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more. Uh,|sv
I think the whole parole thing, you know, if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen years, well, they are out in six or seven. You know, outbound on the streets again|sv
Yeah.|b
And to me that's really scary.|sv
Some of these crimes that they commit, you know, seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, uh, I don't know with, with my limited, uh, psychology background I do have, I don't, I don't even feel that prisons and stuff are, are the answer.|sv
If you want to stop the crime, I think you've got to get, uh, the people when they are kids.|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
A lot of this probably just starts with, from the, from the homes. Also from the, the, the media, the T V -s, the, uh,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
all these, uh, gory movies on there becomes, uh, just a natural fact of life.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
They think it's okay thing to do.|bf
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|b^m
I think that's a very good point.|sv
You know, I, -|%
there's a lot more working mothers, a lot more kids in day care centers all that kind of thing.|sd
Morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore.|sv
And, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Well, a lot of the European countries, uh, they tend to sensor, -|sd
well, they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they have a lot less crime.|sd
Huh.|%
Some of, some of those European countries are, are, you can leave your, your, uh, doors open and, and, and be safe.|sv
Uh, even, uh, I think New Zealand is one of, one of the places, uh, that, -|sv
Uh, so my favorite team is about the Rangers.|sd
Is it?|bh
I'd have to agree with that.|sd
They are my favorite team, too.|sd
Yeah.|b
A little disappointing the last few years.|sv
I'm telling you.|ba
You think they'll sign Ruben?|qy
You know --|sv
No?|br
I just don't think, you know, with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money, twenty-seven or twenty-nine million or whatever it was, I just don't think that they're going to be able to sign Ruben Sierra|sv
and it's just going to be a shame for, you know, our area.|sv
Right.|aa
Yeah,|aa
I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other, uh, Hispanic players.|sv
Oh, I do, too.|aa
I just, -|%
I think --|sv
The main thing, -|%
It's just going to effect on the, the team, you know.|sv
Right.|b
We just can't seem to, you know, -|sv
I think we've been in this spot,|sd
I think we finished second once or maybe even twice.|sd
I don't know,|h
I --|sd
Yeah.|b
It's just, it's just too disappointing.|sd
I just watch them fall every year.|sd
Right.|b
I was a Pete Incaviglia fan|sd
and, uh --|sd
Oh.|b
but, of course, I understand baseball decisions are all just, -|sd
decisions like that have to be made by someone|sd
Glad it's not me making them.|sd
Right|b
I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here.|sv
But, -|%
They say as long as they draw up two million fans that --|sd
Right.|aa
Right,|aa
yeah.|aa
So, and that's the name of the game, too.|sv
You got to make money.|sd
Right.|b
now, it's just --|sv
Right.|b
You and I should be so lucky to, you know, to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that.|sd
That's true.|aa
But, uh, they were talking about trading him, if they're not able to sign him and, uh, use the money that it would take to sign the guy, you know, to pay for pitchers or, you know, what it, what it, what they, what else they need.|sd
Because they've got the hitting,|sv
but they need the pitching.|sv
Yeah,|aa
they really do.|sv
Um.|%
I think they, uh, I think they need them all.|sv
I just don't under-, I understand the big cities, like in New York or L A or somewhere because big cities -|sd
and, you know, a guy, a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a --|sv
Oh, I know.|aa
but, I realize the difference,|sd
but, I just don't understand,|sd
Yeah,|b
it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working, you know, your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game.|sv
Oh, I know.|aa
I tell you.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
It's real aggravating,|sv
but, -|%
But, one thing I don't understand is why a group, you know, headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them|sd
because I tell you, we need a winner in this town.|sv
It looks like our Cowboys are coming back|sv
but,|sv
That's right.|aa
but, you know, in the past half a dozen years, all we've had is the, uh --|sd
It's always got, -|%
Yeah,|b
it's always, it's always wondered me why, I mean, they act as though this area is not, you know, a big metropolitan area,|sv
but you think we'd, someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the, the, the players we need.|sv
Oh, I know.|sd
It's, -|%
Just real aggravating to|^2
because I've lived here, you know, since, well, I was born and raised here,|sd
so I've been a Ranger fan since about seventy-seven,|sd
so it's a lot of losers|sv
Oh, I know.|aa
It's about to get, you know --|sv
I've been one,|sd
Yeah,|b
I've been, I've lived here since seventy-four|sd
and I've really been a Ranger fan for the longest time|sd
and excuse me, I don't miss a time picking up the morning paper --|sd
Right.|b
I mean I follow them|sd
and I follow them like I follow the Mavericks and like I follow the Cowboys,|sd
but, and I want to see them win, because you know, damn it, they, the fans deserve it.|sv
I mean, it,|sv
Right.|b
I'm telling you.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I love Nolan Ryan.|sd
I guess you probably love him, too.|sv
Right,|b
I think this town would go crazy if they ever got a, even a playoff team.|sv
Oh, I --|aa
T-, I mean,|sv
And they got that new stadium they are building.|sd
So, at least, at least that will be exciting --|sv
It will.|aa
but, -|%
Well, where do you think they are heading this year?|qo
Uh, it's hard to say.|sv
It's going to be depending on where the, what they do with Ruben Sierra|sv
and, uh, I mean, I'm getting tired of them going into each year saying, you know, Bobby Witt is the answer and Kevin Brown --|sd
Right|b
and, man, that's getting old, you know.|sv
These guys have been pampered.|sv
I mean, it's time to, to either, you know, put out or shut up.|sv
Yeah,|b
Bobby Witt --|sd
And, -|%
and they have the later ten game winning streak --|sd
Right.|b
-- and they give him all kinds of money|sd
and then he just goes right down the tubes.|sd
And Valentine and Greave, they're about to get, you know, they're about to get old.|sv
But I like this Sandy Johnson.|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Gene|sd
So, it's nice to talk with you|fp
and, um, food is a very intriguing thing.|sv
Our lives are, are built around foods that we like and, an-, nutritionally good for us.|sv
Yes, sir.|ba
What kind of dining out do you like?|qw
Well, there is two kinds.|sd
One I guess I'd say is with my wife where we enjoy, uh --|sd
Oh.|b
Uh, you know, something nice.|sd
Yeah.|b
And the other is with my whole family whom we, uh, go somewhere that the kids will enjoy|sd
Uh, recently we have been hitting Pancho's up.|sd
It's a local Mexican restaurant.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
because they have got a good rate on, you know, good prices and everything.|sd
Pancho's, that's,|qy^d
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|ny
Uh-huh.|b
it's, it's a chain down he-, uh, -|sd
it goes up into Colorado and down here.|sd
I don't know where else it is.|sd
What about you?|qo
We have one called Chi Chi's in th-, in our area.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
And, uh, we had a restaurant called La Bamba|sd
but it's just, it closed recently.|sd
But Chi Chi's is a national restaurant, I think.|sv
Isn't it Mexican?|qy
I think,|sv
Do you have it there?|qy
I've se-, I think I've seen it around.|sd
Yes, sir.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Well, I love Mexican food myself.|sd
Oh, do you?|bh
Yeah.|%
But you go ahead now|ad
Oh, we, we do too.|sd
We, uh, we enjoy Mexican food.|sd
I'm just not impressed with the quality of it.|sd
It's just primarily the price that's, uh, satisfying at this point.|sd
But the kids,|sv
Is that right?|qy
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, and, uh, let's see.|^h
We've, uh, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here|sd
but it's, uh, not part of a chain|sd
it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.|sd
But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had -|sd
that was, uh, not just really super.|sd
It's nice to find a place like that.|sv
Oh, boy that is wonderful.|ba
Yeah.|b
Well, I, I agree with you on that.|aa
And I wa-, was really a seafood addict myself.|sd
I, I love crab meat in particular.|sd
Um.|%
I, uh, I can almost live on, on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to.|sv
Oh, boy.|ba
Have you ever been to, uh, what is it, Original Book Binders in Philadelphia?|qy
I, uh, know the name|^h
but I haven't been there.|ng
Uh, that's an old established, uh, restaurant.|sd
I used to go there when I was in college.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Where did you go to college?|qw
Uh, I went to the Naval Academy.|sd
Oh, the U S ,|br
And we used to,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, -|%
yeah,|%
we would go over there to, uh, -|sd
pr-, pretty sure it was original, Original Book Binders|sd
I think it was,|h
yes.|aa
I'll be darn.|ba
I haven't been back there in years.|sd
Well, we're, we're supposed to be talking about dinning out,|sd
but I'll just make one comment that, uh, I just retired from Penn State,|sd
and, uh, all my work has been in research for the Navy|sd
Okay.|b
What area?|qw
Underwater acoustics.|sd
Is that right?|bh
Did you have any dealings with the, uh, underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?|qy
I have dealt with nearly all of the, all of the research laboratories that the country has.|no
Yes, sir.|ba
My dad worked there for years, and years.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's wh-, that's, uh, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando.|sd
So, -|%
Oh, you grew up in Orlando.|qy^d
Uh-huh.|%
That's, uh, that's interesting, Well, I was in submarines. Uh,|sd
Well, that's what I worked on.|sd
Okay,|b
yeah,|%
must have had some interesting, uh, assignments for you there.|sv
Wh-, when did you retire?|qw
The end of last month.|sd
Well, great.|ba
I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics.|qy^d
I certainly have|na
Yeah.|b
So, wa-, I hate to, uh, -|sd
I wish I could talk to you about that, uh,|sd
but, uh, I guess we should continue on, uh, -|sv
Okay.|aa
Okay.|b^m
Right.|b
Where's, -|qw
How do you like Chinese food?|qw
Oh, we, we do enjoy that.|sd
Yes, sir.|%
Uh, I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,|sv
we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant|sd
and then we usually stick by it.|sd
But do you,|qo
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food.|sd
Hot?|br
Yes.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
Yep, uh,|b
it's, uh, -|%
I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself.|sd
I have in the past.|sd
I haven't done recently,|sd
but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals.|sv
Um. Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?|qw
Uh, just at home.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, I enjoyed the food|sd
and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks,|sd
and I've been following through on that.|sd
When you find the right cookbook, why it works out.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?|qw
Okay,|b
well, that one's a good question.|^h
Here it's right under my nose if I can find it|sd
Oh, boy.|ba
I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of the mill chop suey and things like that.|sd
Yeah,|b
right.|b
But we enjoy trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, sh-, you know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant.|sd
One of th-, th-, this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.|sd
Uh, it's a paperback|sd
and I think it's by someone named Chang.|sd
Yeah,|aa
Isabelle Chang.|sd
Okay,|bk
thanks for that, uh, reference.|ft
Yeah,|bd
yeah.|bd
I think you will enjoy that.|sv
Okay,|b
good.|ba
Yeah.|%
Well, it certainly is nice talking with you Gene.|fc
And, uh, what is your phone at home?|qw
That's it.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yes.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
What do you think are possible changes in the, uh, way trials are conducted these days?|qw
Do you like the way some people in there for instance, really take over and, uh, we have no way, uh, of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth.|qy
Yeah.|ny
What do you think about these things?|qo
Well, as I look at our trial systems,|sd
I think they've gotten to be quite a joke. The way the people can appeal and file for mistrials|sv
and they've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage.|sv
I think that a jury should listen to the courts, uh, to, to the hearings and to everything,|sv
but I think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision.|sv
I think the judge should hold the, or maybe even forty-nine,|sv
and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other.|sv
Y-, so you're saying yo-, you think the judge should actually have the final say?|bf
I think he should.|sv
And I think that there should be more than one judge.|sv
There should be maybe two, at least --|sv
Huh.|%
Do you know what I mean?|qy
Yes.|ny
I know what you mean.|sd
Um, and I think that there, it's important to have a jury, but I think the way that they go through so much time to get it a fair one.|sv
That's okay too.|sv
As long as it's not used to delay the trial so much.|sv
They need to have a fair jury|sv
but they only w-, you know, would cover fif-, forty-nine percent of the decision or fifty percent|sv
and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision.|sv
Well,|sd
How do you feel about that?|qo
I have been in a fairly important trial,|sd
and, uh, what bothers me is I was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand --|sv
Right.|b
That's the part that bothered me about it.|sd
Um, I really think that the, the, the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they are guilty or not.|sv
But I also think that the jury should be, uh, very, very, uh, carefully, more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intel-, intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accu-, accurate decisions.|sv
Right.|b
I hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and don't know much about any of this stuff,|sd
and, and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time.|sv
Right.|b
That's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem.|sv
Right.|b
Well, what if they used, you know, -|qw
I just had a thought come as you were talking.|sd
What if they used law students and had that be credit hours to sit in trials?|qw
That would be certainly nice|sv
sh-, let's say|ad
we, we would have fifty percent of them law students,|sd
Yeah,|aa
at least.|aap_am
At least,|bf
Yeah.|aa
And that would give them,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major.|sv
That's a very neat idea,|sv
and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life --|sv
Right.|b
That's right.|aa
That would be a really good thing to do.|sv
That would be a, a really good thing to do.|sv
So it's -|%
I have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial,|sd
Huh.|%
and what happened was her husband was, uh, involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight|sd
and he ran into the motorcycle.|sd
Huh.|%
But the reason, the actual reason that the motorcycle person, her husband, was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle.|sd
He was just taking it home from the place.|sd
It was brand new,|sd
and his brakes did not work.|sd
For goodness sakes.|ba
And this expensive, big company that owned these motorcycles, um, railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady|sd
and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they were following him home in the car. Saw the whole thing happen.|sd
Oh, they saw the husband,|qy^d
That's right.|na
They were following him home from the motorcycle shop.|sd
Yeah.|b
And they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials, um, this and that and the other.|sd
Every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of her,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They would find something wrong with it.|^2
Until finally they won and,|sd
Did they really?|qy
Uh-huh.|b
but I just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money, the big lawyers, and she didn't,|sv
That is a shame.|sv
You'd think there would be enough, uh, people who saw the accident other than his wife,|sv
Right.|b
and they have nothing to gain one way or the other.|sv
So if they say a certain way, then why not believe them.|sv
Right.|b
And I don't know all the details on that,|sd
but I certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the, the stu-, the students coming into the jury.|sv
Yeah.|b
And I don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Hi.|fp
How are you doing?|fp
What,|br
I couldn't hear you?|sd
I said, how are you doing?|fp
I'm doing fine.|fp
I'm, uh, just editing a spreadsheet right now.|sd
I'm trying to figure out how I can retire without having to work until I'm ninety-five.|sd
Yeah.|b
We've been doing that too|sd
We're trying to retire in our fifties.|sd
Yeah.|b
This is a very appropriate topic for our, uh, conversation today because what I'm figuring out is that I'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what I'm making|sd
Good luck on that one, then.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
What is that?|br
I said good luck on that one, then.|sd
Well, we've got a pretty good situation, my wife and I, since our property is already paid for.|sv
You know, the main things that I like about the uh, in the job benefits --|sd
Huh-uh.|b
You know, they give you an opportunity to either transfer into an on going, on going project. -|sd
So you work for it T I then|qy^d
You can't say?|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
Yeah.|b^m
What?|br
Yes,|ny
you do.|sd
Well, I work for D I S D|sd
and I don't know what your talking about when you say health insurance,|sd
but Dallas doesn't pay.|sd
It pays most of mine, you know,|sd
now, after you work I think five years, they begin to pay most of it.|sd
But then, for the, the family, you know, I put my kids on my policy.|sd
It's like two hundred dollars --|sd
Huh-uh.|b
-- and it's gone up quite a bit|sd
and they predict, you know, of course, it's going to keep going up.|sd
I wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage, at some point.|sd
And benefits, you know, -|sd
I'd like to see child care paid for or on-site child care sometime.|sd
I think that would be a , -|sd
Huh-uh.|b
and it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of.|sv
They could go visit them during the day.|sd
What?|^g
Yeah|b
that's uh, something I hadn't really thought about because we don't have children.|sd
But, I can see how it would be a a real benefit.|sd
Yes|ny
I do.|sd
Well, we keep a shelter, also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too.|sd
You know, go on and pay a lump sum|sd
and as long as you pay that amount you're okay.|sd
But if you paid in more than you actually used, and the same thing for insurance, what you predict your going to be paying for insurance, as long as you pay, actually pay out that amount of money, you're okay.|sd
But if you pay out less, then you lose that money.|sd
Um.|%
I don't like that part,|sd
but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to.|sd
Well, that could be, I could see where that would be important.|sd
And then we got that cafeteria plan,|sd
do you have that?|qy
No.|nn
No.|b^m
I don't know what it's about .|sd
You can, uh, -|%
well you, -|%
let's see, it, it shelters you're money that you pay for, for insurance.|sd
It takes it out of your salary before taxes.|sd
Oh, okay.|b
Yeah,|ny
yeah|ny
we got that.|sd
Okay.|b
Pretax insurance?|bf
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|b^m
But we call it the cafeteria plan,|sd
I wonder why.|sd
Um?|br
I said, I wonder why.|sd
Oh, it's probably what the first guy who did it, called it.|sv
Cafeteria?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yeah.|b
He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it|sv
Maybe|aap_am
so. Let's see what else can we do?|qo
Changes, -|%
I'll tell you what we could do.|sd
What?|qw
We could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money. You know, do a little bit better research on who gets hired --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- Because you know, -|%
You mean, like for health insurance?|bf
Well, not only just health insurance, I mean for the whole benefit of the company.|aap_am
See, I look at it this way. If the company folds, I got to go find a job.|sd
Yeah.|b
Okay.|b
Now, if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs, just about anybody in the company, and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job, then we should find a place to put them or you know, boot them out.|sv
Well, that's easier done in a company than it is in, uh, school teaching.|sv
Well, frankly, I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid.|sv
Thank you|ba
What?|br
I said, thank you.|sd
Oh.|b
We're both school teachers.|sd
Oh, I'm, I'm, -|%
But it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good.|sd
I know.|sd
It's almost impossible.|sd
Well, there's two schools of thought on that.|sd
You know, I, I'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor --|sd
Huh-uh.|b
-- I got about eight years of education ahead of me before I can do that --|sd
Um.|%
-- but, once you get that job with the university, you've got ten years of probation.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Then you have tenure.|sd
And they can't fire you.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Well, you know, in a situation like that, I don't know if that's good or bad.|sd
I do know that I've had tenured professors that were just sorry.|sd
Right.|b
And I've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs.|sd
Well, they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago, you know, in the public schools.|sd
But in addition. -|%
It makes you more at ease.|sd
You know, you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous.|sd
Well, they, they really can't fire you without cause,|sd
you know the governments taken care of that,|sd
but, um, what I'm looking at is, you know, there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid,|sv
and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors.|sv
Right.|b
You know, and I could see a point protecting someone's position,|sd
but, on the other hand, I don't think it, you know, that someone that teaches, uh, say shop, for instance, should have to have degree at all.|sv
Well they don't.|sd
Well. -|%
In some places they don't.|sd
In some places that don't.|sd
Do they?|qy
But, you know, you, you get specialized education now, for instance, take computer science.|sd
We've got kids twenty years old, right now, that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications.|sv
I know we could.|sv
And these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches, because there's no comprehensive test that they can take, that would allow them to, to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, I went to college late on in life|sd
and I realize that hey, it's nothing but four years of endurance|sd
and you might be teachable,|sd
you know what I mean?|^g
Yeah.|ny
I mean, my agree is absolutely worthless. *listen; agree is probably degree|sv
It's my experience and, and my knowledge that, that is beneficial,|sv
but then, you know, like I said, I came in backwards.|sd
What did you get your degree at?|qw
Industrial Marketing.|sd
And what's your job now?|qw
Well, actually I'm selling computer software.|sd
But, the two are mutually exclusive. Because, the, the experience that got me the job that I got now, was my experience in the construction field, prior to going to college --|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Maybe.|aap_am
All right,|%
what else could we change?|qo
Oh, I'd like to see flexible hours. And teaching,|sd
Well uh,|sd
Well, see, we've got a little bit of it, but not much.|sd
It would be nice if you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing.|sv
What else.|t1
I'd like to be able to, to evaluate your boss|sd
and it really carry some weight,|sd
and you get to choose your boss.|sd
Well, -|%
yeah.|b
Supervisor evaluations have always been a tough one. Especially in my line, because, you know, my supervisor has nothing to with my job, except to make sure I get my check.|sv
Huh-uh.|b
Well, so you get to evaluate him though?|qy
Well, not really.|ng
You know, I mean, there's, what's to evaluate about him, you know,|qh
I mean, my, my, supervisor level is like practically zero.|sd
I run the whole show.|sd
And when I need something, I tell my boss|sd
and he gets it for me, because he knows, that I know, what I'm doing.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, and uh, that, that is something that I think needs to be expanded on, specially in the large market place. You know, the major corporation, because so often, you know, you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas --|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, it's, it's hard for me to, you know, especially since I'm in marketing sales, you know,|sd
I make more than my boss. Because he's salary and I'm not.|sd
I make as much as I earn.|sd
You know, if I don't make a sale, I don't make anything|sd
Huh-uh.|b
Yeah.|b
Well it's tough,|sv
but, uh, you know, there are requirements, and quotas, what not, for me to make,|sd
but, um, the bottom line on, on that kind of thing is, you know, we have a lot of people, especially in major corporations, who aren't doing a damn thing.|sv
They're just there.|sv
You know, the work they do could be totally eliminated,|sv
and not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything. But, it's just that their jobs are useless.|sv
Take, for instance, um, a large construction company I used to work for. Ed Swampers.|ad
Swampers is a guy, who's in the union.|sd
He's a laborer.|sd
And he's assigned to, -|sd
So, do you fish?|qy
Oh, yeah.|ny
My dad has a lake cabin,|sd
and so we go there for the small lake, uh, just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area.|sd
It takes us about three hours to get there.|sd
And we go, and we fish,|sd
and we catch a bunch of junk Nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part,|sd
but it's fun.|sd
Uh, from a boat or from shore?|qy
From the dock, from shore.|sd
Oh, that's nice.|ba
Uh, mostly catfish|qy
or, -|%
Oh, mostly we catch carp.|sd
If we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while.|sd
And, you know, we go ahead and eat those.|sd
But we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry.|sd
What we normally do is just, uh, go ahead and clean it up, and then, uh, you know, put it in a bag and freeze it.|sd
And, and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd.|sd
Usually, there's a pretty good crowd there,|sd
so we don't ever catch enough to eat.|sd
Carp is usually pretty much fun.|sd
Because I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little, you know, a little pole with twenty pound test line.|sd
And that, that's a pretty good fight.|sd
So that's a lot of fun.|sd
Yeah.|b
A real light line, real light rig?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Well, that sounds like fun.|sv
They fight hard.|sd
Fish in Colorado s-, different than that. -|sv
Yeah?|bh
Mostly trout in the mountains.|sd
Yeah,|b
and in the rivers and stuff?|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
mountain streams and rivers.|sd
Are they good to eat?|qy
Uh, yeah,|ny
very. Yeah, very much there, you know.|sd
Oh, you mean size wise they're not very big?|qy
Um, by and large, no.|nn
But, but they're big fun.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, I've been, -|sd
is that mostly, uh, fly fishing when you're doing that|qy
or, -|%
What?|br
Are you fly fishing|qy
or are you using a bobber?|qrr
I, I, I'm a fly fisherman.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I, I cast a ways.|sd
I'm not highly proficient,|sd
but it's fun.|sd
I've never even tried that.|sd
My, -|%
if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble|sd
Well, let me explain fly, fly fishing to you then.|oo_co_cc
You're not casting a weight on the end of the line?|qy^d
Uh-huh.|ny
You're casting the weight of the line.|qy
With the little thing on the end.|sd
Yeah,|b
well,|sd
Yeah,|b
I thought it had a weight.|sd
It weighs less than the line.|sd
Oh.|b
So what you do is, you strip off, oh, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And you whip the line.|sd
Um.|b
As you whip it, over your head,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um. So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some?|qy^d
Well, no,|nn
no.|nn
You fish upstream.|sd
Oh, you fish upstream?|qy
Right.|na
And then you let it carry it downstream.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then you reel it in,|sd
and you do it again.|sd
You hope that they think it's a bug and,|bf
Yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
Yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
Yeah.|b
Jump at it.|bf
Uh, from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern.|sd
That's a fish?|br
No,|nn
no.|nn
It, it looks like a grub.|sd
Yeah.|%
Oh, it's a, it's a lure.|bf
Okay,|aa
whenever you, yeah, -|%
a lure, a fly.|sd
I see.|bk
Whenever you have a, something that looks like something else --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and it's a fly, you call it a pattern.|sd
Oh.|b
All right, uh, you know, there's bumble bee patterns --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um.|b
Uh,|%
Did someone just come up with this design,|qy
and, and you're going to make one for yourself,|qy^d
Uh,|%
or are you going to buy it?|qrr
You can buy them.|sd
Uh, I've got some.|sd
And,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, it's just, that, that just happens to be what the fish like this year,|bf
huh?|^g
Yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
Um.|b
You know how that changes, the phase of the moon|sd
and, -|%
I guess so.|na
We tend to use just bait.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I, I,|sd
but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait.|sd
Oh, are you?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Where are you from?|qw
Lubbock.|sd
Oh, I'm from Midland.|sd
Oh, another west Texan.|bf
I went to college at Tech,|sd
so. You've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
Yeah.|b
I've been up there.|sd
It,|sv
I didn't catch anything,|sd
but I've been up there|sd
Yeah,|aa
it's fun.|sv
It's lazy.|sv
Take a picnic lunch.|sd
I used to do that with my dad.|sd
Every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, there you fish mornings and evenings.|sd
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
we do most of our fishing at night.|sd
Yeah.|b
Just from the heat of it all.|sd
That's one advantage you've certainly got on us.|sv
It, at times, gets incredibly hot here.|sd
It does?|bh
I've only been up there once.|sd
In the summer. Well, -|sd
no,|ar
I've been up there twice in the summer.|sd
But both times it was really pleasant.|sd
In fact, it snowed on us in, in, gosh, when was that?|sd
June?|qy
We were in Mesa Verde Park,|sd
and it was like the end of Ju-. It was just before July fourth.|sd
Oh.|b
And it was twenty-eight, twenty-nine degrees.|sd
We were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags, not knowing any better|sd
And here it went and it froze,|sd
and it snowed on us.|sd
Yeah.|b
We did not know what to do about it.|sd
Fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water.|sv
It's, it's a total experience, you know, getting out in nature and,|sv

Uh-huh.|b
Do, -|%

and, -|%
Do you have to, -|qy
do you wear waders when you fish?|qy
Uh, I probably ought to.|ng
I just freeze.|sd
Oh.|b
Goodness, it must be a little bit cold.|bf
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
well, you know,|sd
That's cold water around there.|sd
Um. Do you have any, -|qy
You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it,|sd
Oh, I see.|bk
and you know how it is.|qy^d
The water's kind of, -|sd
Yeah.|aa
And you get, you get a little more carried away with it,|bf
and you move a little closer.|bf
And then you're in to it just a little bit,|sd
and then you splash in|sd
and,|sd
Yeah.|b
Do you have any kids that you take fishing?|qy
Uh, got a stepdaughter.|na
Uh-huh.|b
She's real sweet.|sd
And, uh, at times she enjoys it, at times not.|sd
Yeah.|b
A fuzzy little dog.|sd
I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old.|sd
Oh.|b
And the little one, of course, is, could care less.|sd
Yeah.|b
The, uh, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point, -|sd
we got him a little pole last year,|sd
and just put, uh, his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up|sd
That was what he considered fishing|sd
This year, he's gotten to where he can.|sd
We, we were at a friend's, uh, stock pond, we were out at their farm,|sd
and, and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal-, we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish.|sd
Yeah.|b
And he started trying to cast it.|sd
So, he, he was kind of getting there|sd
but he's,|sd
Yeah,|b
you guys sure want to be out of range.|sv
He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in.|sd
It takes time.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Last year, we had a, oh, just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake. * Trapper's Lake in Colorado?|sd
Oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time.|sd
And we still had a good time out,|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, that's good.|ba
Uh, and Colorado is a beautiful place to live.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
My husband would like to live there,|sd
but I don't know. All of our family is here|sd
so, -|%
Well, and you've got to have, -|sd
you've got to work for a living.|sd
Well, yeah,|aa
but T I is up there,|sd
so that part of it would probably work out|sd
What division you all in?|qw
I'm sorry, what?|br
What division are you all in?|qw
We're both, uh, -|sd
I was, uh, military,|sd
but he's division three.|sd
It goes back and forth.|sd
Division, well, -|sd
maybe division one right now.|sd
He's in computers.|sd
Oh.|b
So, -|%
Well, the only thing up here,|sd
And he's in school,|sd
I have some friends who work up there.|sd
Oh, yeah?|bh
Kathy and Kevin Guy.|sd
Okay.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
And they like to fish.|sd
They've been inviting us to come up there in the summer.|sd
Her dad has a cabin,|sd
and they go fishing, up there.|sd
Oh, fishing's,|sd
So that would be neat to,|sd
It's not, -|sd
It seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there.|sd
But it is fun.|sd
Yeah,|b
You know,|sv
long as you have a good time, that's the main point|sv
so, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
You know, it seems more relaxing, there's more to look at.|sv
Definitely more to look at.|aa
And, and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up.|sd
We camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago.|sd
And we figured we were up a long way off.|sd
And then it rained that night,|sd
and we thought, well, wonder how far off we are?|sd
And we got up the next day,|sd
and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away|sd
And it's like, oh, well, maybe we ought to move just a touch.|sd
So, that was kind of funny.|sd
Yeah,|b
it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I just love the way it looks.|sd
I could almost just watch the wa-, -|sd
we, in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much,|sd
and if you were there. I mean, -|sd
it was, -|sd
one time we were there,|sd
and I guess it was late May,|sd
so it was really your spring almost,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, and the, I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt,|sd
and the creek was just wild, just running.|sd
And, and all the white water and noise and the, -|sd
it was just beautiful.|sd
Yeah.|b
I-, -|%
it gets f-, foamy almost.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And you know it's just pure and pristine.|sd
Yeah.|b
and, -|%
Okay, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I have two children|sd
and they're older now,|sd
but, um, I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, um, I wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old I preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home|sd
and that's what I looked for|sd
and I was lucky enough to find one right across from my school,|sd
and that worked.|sd
Well, that's good.|ba
Yeah,|aa
that worked out real well|sd
but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation, three, I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yes,|aa
yeah.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
so -|%
but I had, -|%
I have switched schools several times because I, di-, I really didn't care for what was going on at that the school.|sd
I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age.|sd
Yeah,|b
I, um, -|%
that, that's, -|%
oh, oh, you mean you switched schools for the kids.|bf
Yeah,|aa
for the sch-, for the kids.|b^m
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
We-, -|%
well, I'm just recently married.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So I don't have any children.|sd
Okay.|b
but I think, um, that I, that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties, uh,|sv
I think, um, I'm lucky though that, um, my wife will probably not have to work while our children,|sd
Oh.|b
Wonderful.|ba
Yeah,|b
I'm a college professor,|sd
Oh,|b
so, -|%
great.|ba
and that's also, -|%
and it's nice for me because, um, most of the time you have so, so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or three days a week,|sd
Um.|b
Great.|ba
Oh that's, wonderful.|ba
Yeah,|aa
so it will probably workout real nice for us, uh,|sd
Yeah.|b
I think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules,|sd
That's wonderful.|ba
I can even teach on Saturdays and,|sd
Oh,|b
great,|ba
Yeah,|b
um, I do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding, uh, child care,|sd
Right.|b
and one of the things they made in, um, uh, -|sd
real -|%
they're number one priority was that, um, they're children didn't have to leave their home *transcript error--spelling of initial "they're" should be "their"|sd
Oh, that's,|ba
So,|%
my sister-in-law is a, uh, um, a clinical speech pathologist,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so, she is als-, -|sd
I guess her most recent position after she returned back to work, she applied for a director's position an-, and got it.|sd
So, I guess she's very well qualified for her field I guess|sd
and even though she took off two years for, um, -|sd
I guess four years all together, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
it would be three years,|sd
how old's Kayla|t1
three, yeah,|t1
I guess she took off three years all together, um, for cause I guess they have a four year old,|sd
and yeah, and my nephew is two, almost two,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so I guess she took off three all together|sd
and then when she decided to go back to work, um, she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home.|sd
Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
Yeah,|aa
I think they were really lucky there,|sd
but I think they've lost this woman she wi-, she will not continue.|sd
Oh, dear.|ba
And, and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school.|sd
Sure,|b
yeah.|b
So I don't know what they are going to do.|sd
Oh, you know that's an ideal situation,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but not many people can afford,|sd
Yeah,|aa
I think,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so she was probably twenty-seven when they were married,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so she already had, had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a,|sd
Sure.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and, and he got himself pretty far along, I guess they didn't have kids until he was about, twenty sev-, twenty-six|sd
so by that time she was so well established, you know,|sd
Right.|b
Sure.|b
but, uh, I think the longer you wait the easier, the easier it is,|sv
Oh, I do to.|aa
Oh, yeah,|aa
Yeah.|b
but they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that, uh,|sd
Yeah.|b
That's right,|aa
that's true, yeah.|aa
uh, because I'm a single parent,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I, uh, you know, my husband and I, ex-husband and I got a divorce, um, when the children were small|sd
and so I, uh, was a teacher|sd
I, uh, still am teacher,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was what I wanted,|sd
Yep.|b
Yeah,|aa
and I knew my kids were being taken,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
and, uh, plus I, I, uh, wanted them to get something out of it,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah|b
that, -|%
yeah,|aa
that's, you know, that's so important I, um, I, I guess it's so funny now with schools, you know, they don't take kid into kindergarten, and when, I guess when they're five, -|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now.|sd
Right.|b
They don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know their A B C -s|sd
and I think that's so funny because, um, I don't, I don't know if I want -|sd
Sure.|b
and I, -|%
it's a very important part of your life|sv
and I hope to read with my kids,|sd
but I don't know if I want my kids to go to school. At four,|sd
Well.|%
I agree with that.|aa
you know, I can see tha-, that when you make that point.|sd
Well, the thing is,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yep,|b
uh-huh.|b
and so I want my -|sd
I wanted my children|sd
and they did learn to get, to get along with other people.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
that's a really important point.|sv
Yeah,|aa
and I mean I feel a lot of maladjusted adults|sv
and I bet if we trace back to their,|sv
Yep.|b
I think that's really, that's important|sv
I, I've seen the same thing|sd
I, I think you're exactly right because, you know, I've gone ou-, -|sv
or -|%
before I was married I went out with a girl,|sd
and you know, um, boy, after, you know, after about two months I realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I bet, -|sd
and they could be traced back to just not being, uh, you know, being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I bet you could trace all the way back|sv
I bet you could too,|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really, you know, good adults or,|sv
That's true,|aa
yeah.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
you know, really|%
but, uh, it is a big problem|sv
and you kno-, I have lot of friends right now that, uh, have young children|sd
and they daily have problems with, with whoever is taking care of the child,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
or they switch a lot, which is not good for the child either.|sd
Yep,|aa
that's true.|aa
Yeah,|aa
that's really true.|aa
So you need, -|%
cause you need that consistency when they're young like that,|sv
and it would be ideal like you, you hope when you have children,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
I would have, have given anything if I would have been able,|sd
Yeah,|b
I, I think I'm, I'm very lucky.|sd
Yeah,|aa
you. -|%
Um, because of having, you know, flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule.|sd
Right.|b
Especial-, -|%
I teach a computer classes|sd
so,|sd
Oh, great.|ba
and I'm also, um, you know, -|sd
they have vocational type courses on weekends,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and, you know, you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday,|sd
Oh, that's,|ba
so that lets you be available three days during the week,|sd
Oh, great.|ba
so you be will home with your kids I you know|sd
it's really funny is that I, I picked this career when I was in college because, uh, I think with my commitment to family and, um,|sd
Um.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
so, by the time he got home he was so tired|sd
and he was all rung out from the day,|sd

You know, my mother -|sd
I, I came from a family, tha-, that my mother stayed home until we started school.|sd

That makes sense.|ba
Okay.|%
Guess we can go ahead.|sd
Uh, well, I guess you know it's, you know, -|sd
since living in Dallas it's always so hot, so in the summertime, I just, I wear lots of shorts, so because I don't work during the day.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, do you work?|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh,|ny
yeah,|ny
I do work.|sd
Oh.|b
Uh, and, -|%
but I work at a manufacturing plant,|sd
so I wear a lot of blue jeans,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But occasionally I have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I feel really uncomfortable doing that|sd
and,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But, normally I just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Very, very, comfortable.|sd
I like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
and buying suits and stuff, yeah, because just being at home -|bf
and, I work at home,|sd
so,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't go out and spend lots of money on, uh, different, you know, suits and stuff, you know.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
But when I, -|sd
before I got married, you know, I was working|sd
so I, uh, you know, I had more suits and stuff then|sd
but, -|%
Right|b
Worry about all that kind of stuff -|sd
Well, I have plenty of suits and dress clothes because I'm like you, when I first started working,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
but now that I, you know, work in the manufacturing plant, then it's just, it's so much more difficult for me to, to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that.|sd
Right.|b
Uh, but occasionally I have to because, uh, part of my job is teaching,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal,|sd
When you're training, right.|bf
Yeah.|b
Than your normal garb|sd
But I'm like you, too, uh, I moved from Ohio down to here --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
moved from,|bf
-- and I had mostly polyesters and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then, of course, you have to iron them all the time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's really, -|%
that's been a problem for me.|sd
Yeah,|aa
because I came from Wyoming|sd
and I had wool suits and wool skirts|sd
and,|sd
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
And, uh, the seasons are just so much different.|sd
You have so much summer.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, so then when I, you know, I finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear|sd
That's true, that's true.|aa
Yeah|b
Well, I know, I was just now, uh, uh, putting away a lot of my winter clothes,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I was going through here|sd
and I was thinking, I haven't worn this in three years.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, because it's a wool skirt|sd
and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I have five or six wool skirts,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so I was thinking well, maybe, you know, I need to think about getting rid of them,|sd
but no, I folded it up neatly and put it away maybe next year|sd
Yeah.|aa
You hate to get rid of it, because you know how much you spent on them.|bf
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
And it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff, I know.|sd
So, -|%
Well, I know last year, uh, well, this past winter, it wasn't that cold.|sd
Uh-huh.|b

And, uh, -|%
and then you can ha-, actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall, you know, to have it,|sd

and it's just, it's just an eyesore, I think,|sd

it is, it is,|aa
but it's like, uh, I just don't want to do it|sd
Uh-uh,|aa
uh-uh.|aa

I no longer do that weekly thing,|sd

Well, presentation's not always all of it either.|arp_nd
Well, like --|sd
It's, it's important.|sv
and we're trying to give them a little patronage.|sd
But Sunday we went there,|sd
and I had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple and potatoes.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce, something like that|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
something a little extra --|bf
Yeah,|aa
that's what I mean by, -|sd
-- and just for color if nothing else.|sd
Right,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
What I miss up here is, I'm originally a Texan, and I miss home cooked Mexican.|sd
Tex-Mex, Tex-Mex.|bf
Yeah,|aa
home cooked Tex-Mex.|b^m
Uh, Mexican restaurants where it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation.|sd
Right,|aa
I know.|sd
Uh, we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico,|sd
and we've really gotten to like, -|sd
we like the real Mexican food --|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, there's real Mexican food|sd
and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican, you know, by third or fourth generation Americans --|sd
Right.|b
It's all pretty good, isn't it?|qy
Oh, yes,|ny
and, and there's big differences, of course,|sv
and, of course, when you talk about Mexican cuisine you, that's kind of like talking about American food or Chinese food, in because its regional, too.|sv
Right,|aa
uh-huh,|aa
that's true.|aa
So. -|%
I'm originally from Maine,|sd
so we like seafood, too.|sd
And that's something we don't get here,|sd
and we're in the mountains in Virginia.|sd
Oh.|b
And most of the seafood's frozen.|sd
Uh, yeah|aa
that's the way it is here in Colorado, also.|sd
No fresh, or almost no fresh seafood --|sd
Right.|aa
-- and in Texas we got it from the Gulf.|sd
Uh-huh,|aa
that's true.|aa
Lots of shrimp.|sd
And, yeah,|aa
here a couple years ago my wife and I went to Seattle on vacation.|sd
And I think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week.|sd
I know it|ba
And it was, -|%
I was like a man starving at every meal.|sd
I know the feeling.|ba
We do the same thing.|sd
My son-in-law is a Texan,|sd
and when he goes to Maine, he eats lobster, I guess, at least twice a day, all the time he's up there|sd
It's a lot cheaper there, isn't it?|qy
Lobster?|^g
Oh, yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
It's like --|sd
It's like shrimp on the Gulf.|sd
Two ninety-eight a pound.|b^m
Yeah.|b
That's as cheap as steaks some places --|sd
Oh yeah,|aa
cheaper,|sd
right.|aa
Right,|aa
yeah.|aa
A lot of the restaurants you can get two pou-, two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety-nine.|sd
Oh, my gosh.|ba
I've got to go to Maine then rattling in|sd
You may have sold a trip for some time.|sd
Yeah,|aa
it's a good place to go.|sv
Uh, it sounds wonderful.|sv
Uh, so, -|%
Lots of little restaurants, too, with home cooked food, that's up there.|sd
That sound good.|sv
Uh, down in the Gulf I've eaten a bunch of those little uh, seafood shacks, we've called them.|sd
Right,|b
uh-huh.|b
And, uh, it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We went to Gal-, -|sd
-- shrimp straight out of the bay.|sd
We were in Galveston last year aft-, right aft-, well, the first of this year, actually.|sd
Hm.|b
And, ate in a restaurant,|sd
and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf coast.|sd
Was it true?|qy
No.|nn
It wasn't.|ng
On the way across Louisiana, we pulled off, we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place.|sd
And they had, -|sd
it was a small restaurant, just kind of out of the way,|sd
and they were set up with two buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything.|sd
Hm.|b
Huh.|b
That was the best shrimp I have ever had in my life.|sd
They had shrimp fixed probably six different ways.|sd
Uh, yes,|b
the cajuns.|bf
Uh-huh,|aa
right.|aa
It was wonderful.|sd
They can, they can do things to shrimp that, that no one else can.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So, have you eaten crawfish yet?|qy
Uh, I tried it,|na
but I didn't care for it.|sd
Not there, but at my brothers I tried it.|sd
Oh, as with anything, it's preparation.|sv
That's probably true.|aap_am
It, -|%
We just, -|%
he went down and bought some at a --|sd
Uh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
It, -|%
there's all kinds,|sd
Probably needed some cold beer with it|sv
and -|%
So you do eat out a lot.|qy^d
Quite a bit.|na
One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning brunches.|sd
Oh.|b
You know, Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches.|sd
Right.|b
We used to do that, once in a while,|sd
but we don't anymore.|sd
Uh, we still find it fun.|sd
Uh-huh.|aa
It's fun,|aa
but it's just so much food|sd
Hate to come away feeling uncomfortable|sd
Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor.|sd
Do you,|bh
well that makes a difference.|sv
And so, -|%
Where do you go to brunches? -|qw
Like at hotels, or restaurants there?|qy
Yeah,|ny
uh, actually one of our, one of our favorites is a chain. Shoney's.|sd
Oh, yeah,|ba
uh-huh.|b
We eat at Shoney's.|sd
Yeah,|b
in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chains, chain restaurants, uh, we, uh, do like Shoney's pretty well,|sd
but then there's a place up the pass, up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings, drive, drive up to, I think it's about eight thousand foot elevation.|sd
Oh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
that sounds nice.|ba
It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning.|sv
Right,|aa
I imagine it is.|ba
I think it's as much the, the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch.|sd
You know, and it's not that far.|sd
It's thirty miles.|sd
Whe-, -|%
out of, which direction?|qw
Colorado Springs.|sd
Out of, which direction from there?|qw
West --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- west out of Colorado Springs.|sd
Okay,|%
do you have any pets?|qy
Yes,|ny
I've had, I have had a number of them in my lifetime|sd
and I've, -|%
I am a Golden retriever fan,|sd
Oh.|b
but I had to replace it with something that the kids could carry.|sd
Oh|b
Yes.|b
Yes.|b
Instead of being carried|bf
Yes,|aa
well, they were, -|sd
they really wanted something teeny tiny,|sd
and I, uh, really wanted that retriever's disposition.|sd
Yeah.|b
Really.|b
so I called four or five dog trainers because I don't like the little dogs.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, and I asked them, you know, these are the ages of the kids, what do I get.|sd
And they all said, Golden Retriever|sd
and I said okay,|sd
And the only thing that they could come up with was a Bichon Frize which is a, -|sd
Huh.|b
Do you know what that is?|qy
Yes,|ny
I've seen those.|sd
They're cute.|sv
They're cute.|sv
They look like an air headed let me tell you. -|sv
They're calm, they're not yuppie , they're trainable, they're, uh, very personable in a different way that a Golden Retriever is.|sv
They're not dignified like a retriever can be.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
So how old is your retriever?|qw
Oh, she's about four.|sd
She's not completely pure.|sd
We got her from the, uh, Humane Society when she was a puppy.|sd
She looks like a Gol-, -|sd
she looks just like a Golden Retriever,|sd
but she's a little bit smaller.|sd
She's like fifty-five pounds.|sd
Well, actually, you know, that's the breed standard for females.|sd
What you, -|%
Is it?|qy
yeah,|ny
what you see shown and bred now as Golden Retrievers, this, you know, plus eighty to a hundred pound range.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That is not breed standard.|sd
Huh.|b
Fifty-five is the minimum|sd
but they usually run about sixty to sixty-five.|sd
And the ones that are shown, they are inside that weight allowance.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You cannot show your retriever if it's, you know, a hundred plus pounds.|sd
Oh, huh.|b
So don't say she's small,|ad
Yeah.|b
She's perfect.|b^m
Well, she's got a brown nose instead of black too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Which makes her, I guess, unshowable,|sd
Yep.|aa
but, but we love her anyway.|sd
She's just a lot of company to us.|sd
We didn't, -|%
we haven't had any kids|sd
and we're expecting a baby this summer,|sd
but up until then, she's been our substitute kid|sd
and she was a lot of fun.|sd
Well, they are, they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog,|sd
Right.|b
Oh.|b
and fortunately it was just like a retriever|sd
and then I've had a retriever.|sd
I bet it had a pretty coat too.|sd
It was gorgeous.|sd
It was just gorgeous. I mean just gorgeous.|sd
Um, and they both, you know, -|sd
both the half breed and the pure breed had the, uh, what I consider the, the, the perfect disposition.|sd
But you know what, you know what scares me about Golden Retrievers?|qh
Since they've become so popular you get what I call backyard breeders.|sd
And in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big, for somehow big is perceived as the better.|sd
And when you start doing that you really tamper with, you know, the, all the, the years of, uh, culling litters|sd
and, and, uh, you tamper with what the dog innately is.|sd
Yeah.|b
We w-, -|%
when I was, -|%
when I bought my last purebred retriever I mean I looked all over because I wanted one that still looked like a retriever, you know, the short to the ground, stocky, golden, uh, trainable, tractable, quiet --|sd
Right.|b
And I ended up getting one that, uh, came out of a, a, a hunting stock --|sd
Oh.|b
And I've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb,|sd
and I'm, and I really fear for the breed because I love that breed,|sd
Yeah.|b
but I really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined.|sd
We have some friends with a brother and sister Golden retriever|sd
and those dogs have been having seizures,|sd
and I wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding --|sd
Oh, yeah.|aa
You bet you.|aa
You bet you.|aa
You know how they came up with the retriever, don't you, the Golden?|qy^d
Huh-uh.|nn
It was bred out of several different retrievers,|sd
and they bred it for companionship and, uh, uh, disposition and, and ability to hunt.|sd
It was kept only by kings.|sd
Oh.|b
But they selectively culled those litters, I mean, for many hundreds of years|sd
and since it slept in the castle with its master, I mean it had, it had to be of a disposition to make it, you know, an animal you could keep around that closely.|sd
But they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect.|sd
Now, you know, that seems like a cruel thing to do.|sd
Yeah.|b
On the other hand, you sure, you know, they sure created a, a wonderful breed,|sv
Yeah.|aa
They did.|sv
I, I had never really had a Golden retriever before.|sd
We were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds|sd
and all the other, -|%
we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very, uh, social and stuff.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs|sd
and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down.|sd
And one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling|sd
And that,|sd
Well, I tell you,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Only in America is there a dog called a German Shepherd.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
That dog is bred out of three European dogs. The Belgian Tervurien, a German Skutzhund, and a makes a I always forget the third one. I can see it.|sd
Uh, uh, i-, -|%
but the third one is a children's dog.|sd
Oh.|b
And there are distinct breeds in Europe.|sd
Now what happened over here was is that people saw the, the first, um, which would actually have been a Skutzhund which is what Rin Tin Tin was.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin.|sd
And it was known as a German shepherd here.|sd
So they created a breed standard. The American Kennel Club did.|sd
Oh.|b
That said anything that is a Skutzhund, a, a Tervurien and, uh, Alsatian that's the other one. Alsatian, any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here.|sd
Huh.|b
And what happened is, is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect.|sd
And they bred a dog that I th-, it's called a, an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you.|sd
That German shepherd, the American German Shepherd here was a, a, a such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And even, um, uh, police corps which started, you know, finding other breeds to use because this thing, this, this thing known as a German shepherd here, its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible.|sd
So about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this.|sd
So they went back to Europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it's the Alsatian that's the kid's dog.|sd
It's just, -|%
you see them in Europe|sd
and they're just lovely.|sv
Huh.|b
But you'll see, -|sd
I mean, if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for German Shepherds, they will say on them, bred for disposition, A K C conforming --|sd
Huh.|b
This is bred for, -|sd
and they had to go through and destroy a, for a while there, about seventy-five percent of their puppies that they bred.|sd
Wow.|ba
Because they were looking for this disposition.|sd
And nowadays you, you'll get, you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific, you know, breeder handler.|sd
They will recommend their shepherds as a children's dog.|sd
Huh.|b
But ... -|%
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
well, I'll start off being controversial.|sd
I'm in favor of it.|sd
That doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial.|sv
Well, it seems to be in the current situations|sd
but, uh, I still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime. Particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now.|sv
Well, I think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence, need to be reevaluated.|sv
Okay.|b
I think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I think, uh, -|sv
Crimes against children is one of them.|sd
Oh, definitely.|aa
Any, any crimes against person,|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Actually, I would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in Middle Eastern countries.|sd
If you steal, you lose a hand.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
That's a, -|%
You know, uh, if you kill, you lose your life.|sv
What's wrong with that?|qw
I don't see a thing wrong with that.|sd
Yeah.|b
I believe that, uh,|sd
Uh,|%
I think there's, uh, someone that's on trial right now --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they were interviewing the, the, -|sd
a young lady was killed sometime back,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well, how do you feel about this?|^q
Uh-huh.|b
And, you know|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and they want the person punished and punished,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh|b
Deciding what that proper punishment is, is one thing.|sv
I think that there should be no way, I, I realize that innocent people could go to, uh, what is it, lethal injection now.|sv
Yes.|aa
Innocent people could do that,|sv
but for every innocent person who would be executed, hopefully there would be ten guilty.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well,|sd
Uh,|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
To maintain a prison inma-,|bf
that's right.|aa
That's stupid.|sv
And, well, the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
There are more,|sd
Sure.|b
Uh-huh.|b
or this individual was out on the streets,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Sure.|b
Sure.|b
Well, I don't have solutions to the problems,|sd
but you know you have these, -|sd
this would be nice if|sv
and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory,|sv
Yeah.|b
I think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate.|sv
Yes.|aa
I think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual --|sv
Yes,|aa
indeed.|aa
Yeah.|b
People who kill policemen.|sd
Yeah.|b
No.|aa
Here again, anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That's right.|aa
Now I'm not in favor of gun control to the degree or anything because, uh, there are uses for guns which are noncriminal --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them. Uh, aside from domestic disputes, husbands shooting wives or vice versa.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But these individuals, if they have a gun with them, I think that the, the sentence should be even longer than if they don't.|sv
I don't, I don't agree with the length,|ar
Well,|sd
I think expediency is the answer.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
That's right.|aa
There should be some, uh, -|sv
I know there's a law, I believe, that it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I think that automatic appeal ought to take place, uh, within a reasonable length of time, say six months.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And a decision be made and not drag out in the courts for years,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That's right,|aa
technical, -|b^m
I think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals.|sv
Right,|aa
there's got to be a,|sv
Yo-, -|%
you can appeal it once.|sv
I think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands, then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is, if, if it is,|sv
A, a legit,|^2
Yeah.|b
That's right.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
They're arguing over, well, were his civil rights violated because, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Those are the things that have caused them to drag out I think.|sv
That's right.|aa
Well, one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because of, of the process in which the criminals were apprehended.|sv
Yeah.|b
I mean, uh, you know the guy is guilty.|sv
You know he's done what he's done.|sv
You, you may have stood there and seen it.|sv
But because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested, you know,|sv
He didn't see his,|bf
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Right,|aa
and I realize that that is designed to protect the innocent.|sd
It's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers.|sv
Oh, yes|aa
And, uh, I, I just don't think that,|sv
I think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had some statute of limitations on lawyers|sv
Yes.|aa
I hope you're not a lawyer|qy^d
No,|nn
I'm not a lawyer|ng
I, -|%
I'm an accountant|sd
and I agree.|aa
Yeah.|b
We practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers,|sd
Absolutely.|aa
That's why you check books out from the library.|sv
There you go.|aa
But I really believe that our justice system is, is the best around|sv
but it's not perfect,|sv
and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact. *in tact intact|sv
Well, it's, it's a case that we have a, a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself.|sv
That's right.|aa
So --|sv
That's right.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
That's right.|aa
But you have to continue, uh, to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty.|sv
That's right.|aa
And, and, it, -|%
I don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter.|sv
Yeah.|b
And that just, -|%
that really does ruffle my feathers,|sd
Yes|aa
I mean I can just get so,|sd
But, you know, it's, it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem|sv

Again one of our --|sv

Okay, well, see|bk
I'm, I'm from Chicago,|sd
so uh, I'm kind of in a different category here. Uh,|sd
If you had to pick one, what would you choose?|qw
Uh, I would probably go with, -|sd
it's tough, uh, I think I would just stick with the classics. Only because, uh, I like music just for music's sake|sd
and uh, you know, I'm from the era where, you know, we had all the rock and roll.|sd
I'm forty|sd
so I'm, you know, part of that whole deal|sd
and, uh, that was a real interesting time|sd
and, you know, the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound.|sd
Uh, but I think I'd stick back with my Beethoven and my Bach and my Mozart|sd
I mean because it's just, -|sd
it will always be there.|sd
It's classic|sd
and I don't have to worry about, you know, what's current and what's not because I haven't been current with music for a long time.|sd
But, you know, same, uh, -|%
and, as far as country music is, I've never really, uh, listened to it.|sd
I mean because that's just, -|sd
it was, -|%
it wasn't part of what I knew,|sd
so, there you go|h
Well, I understand what you're saying.|sd
I think if you would listen to it a little, you would discover that it has a lot of roots from the, both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that, that we both lived through.|sv
Right,|b
yeah.|b
Uh|%
I, -|%
it's, it's a different perspective on everything, too.|sv
I, I know, well, whenever they talk about, uh, country music, it's about, it seems sad to me.|sv
It's always about some guy losing some girl and then, you know, playing the guitar and singing about it.|sv
Well, there's some joy in it also.|sd
But, mostly it, it just tells a story about life.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, I must say, though, uh, I listen to Amy Grant.|sd
Do you consider her country?|qy
I don't know.|no
I'm not all that familiar with her work.|sd
Uh, uh, let's see. Well, name some people that are country that I should listen to|ad
That would be good.|sv
Well, I kind of like, uh, I like groups like the Statler Brothers.|sd
Okay.|bk
Oh, okay,|bk
I, I must admit that's, yeah, they're fantastic,|sv
so, uh, uh, -|%
Reba McIntire is a little too country for me.|sd
She's something, though.|sv
She's got so much energy|sv
That's true.|aa
Well, I guess I, I have listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that I do like some of that.|sd
Uh, Dolly Parton, she's kind of, -|sv
is she kind of country?|qy
Oh, yes.|ny

That's certainly where her roots are.|sd
Right down there.|bf
Uh, uh, how about the Oak Ridge Boys.|qo

Very much.|b^m
Okay,|bk
well, I like them, too.|sd
So I guess I've had a smattering|sd

I've picked up a little bit along the way that I probably wouldn't have if I'd stayed up north, you know.|sd
That's true.|aa
You know, so, well, I think there's music all around anyway.|sv
I mean, I think life is just music,|sv
so, you know, you can hear it wherever you want|sv
and, uh, and I've, I've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because I just don't understand it.|sd
But maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which I really like|sv

I get real tickled when I listen to some of these old Beatle, uh, music, you know, the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still|sd

Oh, well --|ba
I do keep my, -|sd
Impart me some wisdom, Catherine|ad
Uh, I do take care of my youngest granddaughter, uh, most every Saturday.|sd

How old is your granddaughter?|qw
She's three.|sd
Oh, so she's a little one.|bf
Yes.|aa

You know, being from Plano, you know, I know so very few people who have extended family in town.|sd

that's --|ba
and, -|%
that's really wonderful.|ba
It is,|aa
it is.|aa
Yeah.|b
And, you know, just so that they get to know their grandparents, but also for help|sd
Yeah.|b
We don't, we don't have that luxury.|sd
But, we have lots of friends,|sd
and, and everybody tends to be in the same boat.|sd
So we, we trade off a whole lot with friends and, you know, run here and run there.|sd
We're right smack dab in the middle of baseball season right now.|sd
And we have three playing baseball.|sd
Oh, that's marvelous.|ba
So -|%
Well they keep you hopping, I'm sure.|sv
They definitely do.|aa
Well, I know, uh, that, uh, one of the ladies I know, they are very involved with their little girl|sd
and, and I think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I think because she is, uh, the only child that they concentrate, uh, they would like to have more,|sd
but that hasn't been, uh, possible.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And, uh, she's tried many, uh, avenues --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and, and so now it's just, you know, that she's kind of resolved herself that, yes, this is going to be the only one|sd
Yeah,|aa
and she devotes,|bf
yeah.|aa
And they're focusing on all of her, uh, welfare.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
well, our kids, you know, -|sd
uh, my daughter s-, uh, sings with Younger Generation, I don't know if you've ever heard of them.|sd
There they're a singing group here in Plano.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
And they're part of the ch-, uh, Plano Children's Civics, Civic Chorus.|sd

so we, we tend to do a lot of running.|sd
Things are very different nowadays than when I grew up --|sv
Oh, they are.|aa
-- and I'm sure when your children grew up you didn't, you know, -|sv
I don't remember doing all these things.|sd
No.|aa
I certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and supporting me in all these things,|sd
but we had more, I guess family time alone --|sd
Yeah,|aa
you're, -|%
Now I think --|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
It can be|aa
and, and sometimes I, you know, I kind of long for the good old days when --|sd
Yeah,|aa
it wasn't so he-, -|bf
But on the other hand, we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You have to look on that, on the, uh, positive side of that.|sv
It's just different.|sv
Yes,|aa
it is.|sd

It's just a different lifestyle.|bf
It's just very different.|b^m
Yes.|aa
Yeah.|b
Uh,|%

My, uh, second grandson is in A Cappella|sd
and I know what you're talking about when he's involved, you know, the children are involved --|sd

he has traveled|sd

Oh, really.|bh
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, I know where you're coming from --|ba
Yeah.|b
-- and it's, it's very nice.|sv
It is very nice.|aa
I think, uh, uh, those type of children, uh, that are involved in things like that, their, uh, goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things.|sv
Well, I think so,|aa
and, and I think they've learned a whole lot about being part of a team, whether the team is your singing group, your band, your --|sv
Right.|aa
Going to, -|%
Yeah.|b
And, uh, -|%
A, a, a team effort,|bf
yes.|%

I think they've learned some real good life skills. Uh, you know, being --|sd
That,|ba
And, uh, -|%
That's really is --|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, there's less, uh, friction involved in relationships when you add that skill --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that.|sv
Yes,|aa
yes.|aa
And I think it's a step, a, a giant step of progress, I really do.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
So, uh, I, -|%
Give me some wonderful advice Catherine.|ad
What is the best advice of mothering that you know?|qw
The best of,|sv
Besides don't sweat the small stuff|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, that's good, that's real good advice.|sv
and, uh, keep your mind off of negative things.|ad
Uh-huh.|b
And keep your mind on positive things|ad
and, and stress that to your children.|ad
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, even if they're, even if they're discouraged, tell them that that's just a passing moment --|ad
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, I think you'll see a lot of growth in, uh, in their ability to, uh, control their thought pattern|sv
and, and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God.|sv
Absolutely.|aa
Well, I would agree with that.|aa
We're also real active in our church|sd
and my kids do an awful lot with that.|sd
Allyson sings in the choir.|sd
I told her that's a gift from God|sd
and you need to return that back.|^q
Oh, absolutely.|aa
That's right.|aa
And you owe, you owe that --|^q
Uh-huh|b
and --|sv
Right.|aa
I'm real proud of her.|sd
I'm equally proud of her when I see her in church as I am when I see her performing.|sd
You know, that's, that's real neat.|sd
Well, if she looks,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Do you work?|qy
Yes,|ny
I do.|ng
I think that's the main change.|sv
What do you think?|qo
Well, I think that's a big part of it|sv
and I, I think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home|sv
and,|sv
Right.|aa
That's right.|aa
But, but yeah, I think that's a big change|sv
I'd like to not work.|sd
What about you?|qo
Well, I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I just, -|%
physically I wasn't able to|sd
and I mean, I love my job.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But I have four children,|sd
and that's real hard.|sd
You have children?|qy^d
I assume so.|qy^d
Yes.|ny
I have two|sd
and that's been a big deciding factor because I mean I never wanted to be a career woman,|sd
Right.|b
but as long as I wa-, w-, you know, was going to work I was going to do as, as much as I could,|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
And I, I wanted to stay home when I had kids.|sd
Well, I have two.|sd
I have a four year old and a three year old.|sd
Oh.|b
And we would like two more|sd
but I, -|%
it's like, we talked. Uh, I don't want two more unless I can quit and stay home and take care,|sd
Right.|b
Oh.|b
It's real hard.|bf
Yeah.|aa
It's real hard.|bf
I mean even I, -|sd
It's full time work.|sd
Yeah.|b
It was so hard for me to work full time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Of course, my kids are, are a little older|sd
but then you, then you give up the money.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know?|qy
You do there's sa-, -|%
of course, you know, everything you give up something|sv
but I just, -|%
I, -|%
the kids are so wonderful|sd
Yeah.|b
.|%
But I do think that's one of the major changes. You know,|sv
my mama I remember her being home --|sd
Yep.|b
Fine .|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yep.|aa
I know.|sd
And if she worked it was part time|sd
and it was work that was done while we were maybe at school,|sd
and she was there when we got home.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, and, -|%
Well, I've decided now in fact, I'm just, I'm substitute teachers aid which is a, afar cry from my travel agent career,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But I'm, I'm there in the same school as my children, my two littler ones.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I'm home when they are home.|sd
In fact, I've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store,|sd
and I'm just really hesitating,|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh.|b
Oh.|b
I mean, well, I didn't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent|sd
and it was wonderful.|sd
Yeah.|b
My kids and I, we just had a ball.|sd
See, -|%
and I think, -|sv
Of course, their, their ages, they are almost seventeen --|sd
Oh.|b
Oh.|b
-- and we are just running every direction|sd
and, -|%
But see, it's such an important time to be home.|sv
It is.|aa
And that,|sd
It is.|aa
you know, my husband was raised, uh, -|sd
his, his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked,|sd
Always worked.|b^m
and he's like well, you know, what's the big deal about being home,|sd
What, yeah.|b^m
Well, as our kids are getting older, you know, he sees it more.|sd
I said, Russ, you don't understand what it was like to have her home or to if you needed,|sd
Right.|b
or,|sd
Right.|b
and, and I want to be able to do those things|sd
so. -|%
I think that, you know, it's good.|sv
You know, sometimes I'll have the cookies ready when they,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, and a lot of my boys, uh, my older boys' junior high friends will come over.|sd
In fact, everyday,|sd
and it's wonderful|sd
I'm real close to the schools|sd
and, you know, we are just -|sd
I, I'm very happy to be staying home.|sd
I think that's wonderful.|ba
But again I miss,|sd
So, where do you see,|qw
I don't.|sd
Well, see that was one of the things s-, the, the question I think is,|sd
I keep on working .|sd
Right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
and I'm, I'm not sure I, I see it go anywhere.|sd
I think they are still going to have to work.|sv
That we are because it's so expensive.|bf
If we want, uh, extra clothes, the extra car, the extra, -|bf
Right.|aa
The thing is, when a woman does work, then there is the clothes to buy,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then there is the gas,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then there is the lunches and then the day care.|sd
The day care eats,|sd
You must pay for , -|sd
day care.|sd
Yeah.|%
You know, I pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty,|sd
Oh --|ba
Yeah,|b
for two.|b^m
They would eat you,|sv
It's almost hardly worth it for you,|sv
I know.|aa
Then you work summers unless you are a teacher.|sd
Are you a teacher?|qy
No,|nn
I'm not,|ng
and I would love, -|sd
you, you, you talked about having the summers off|sd
and I thought, oh, that would be so wonderful.|sd
And I love the little preschool they are in.|sd
It's wonderful.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, so I feel good about them being there|sd
but it's still not the same.|sd
No.|aa
It's not the same.|b^m
It's just not.|sd
I, I don't see things changing really,|sd
and, and it's terrible for divorced women --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Thank goodness I have mine,|sd
and I could get a real good paying job,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Please come back to work.|b^m
and we'll pay you this .|^q
Sure.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
And it's been a real tough decision|sd
but I'm very happy to be here with my kids.|sd
My kids, we've seen a remarkable difference in,|sd
That's wonderful.|ba
That's wonderful.|ba
Yeah.|b
I'm real,|%
and I'm, -|%
but I've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis|sd
I like that.|ba
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
I know .|aa
Well, we're working on it.|sd
I'm hoping in about three to five years I'll be able to stay home|sd
and my kids, of course, will be in school then|sd
but I'll,|sd
Right .|b
Yeah.|b
I feel like,|sd
Well, -|%
and I can work part days in my husband's business, you know, so that,|sd
Oh, that would be great.|ba
Right.|aa
I think the, the other thing that, that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children.|sv
So, Utah.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yes.|aa
That, that's, that's the state that got, was famous when they executed somebody.|sd
Gary Gilmore.|sd
Gary Gilmore.|b^m
Yeah.|b
By firing squad, as I recall.|sd
That's right,|aa
and we still have a death penalty.|sd
Uh-huh|b
Some, -|%
a gentleman, uh, that was one of the hi-fi murderers just had his conviction overturned, well, appealed again.|sd
I guess we have the longest, uh, running inmates for death row too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then we had another guy, uh, Ronald Lafferty, that thought God told him to kill his sister-in-law.|sd
Yeah.|b
He just got a, a new trial because,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, how do you feel about the death penalty?|qo
Well, I, yo-, you know, -|%
until recently I've been sort of, -|sd
could go either way, you know, -|sd
it, it, sort of doesn't much, you know, -|sd
it didn't, -|%
it wasn't a strong issue, um, I guess it still isn't a strong issue.|sd
But I must say, I find it very silly, the way politicians are running around creating more and more capital crimes, um --|sd
Oh.|b
I assume they're doing it for that reason|sd
Well, I'm sure that's . -|sv
By, by by saying well, this, doing th-, this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now.|sv
Well, I kind of a-, agree with terrorism.|sd
I think those guys should be done away with.|sv
That's one of the worst,|sv
and, uh, drug dealing, um,|sv
but, uh,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It's not, it's not enough just to lock them up forever.|sv
Uh, no,|aa
it's got to be something that is going to cost them, because we never lock anybody up forever.|sv
Not often.|aap_am
Not very often at all.|aa
We've got these guys in New York that, uh, I'm sure you heard about, the ones that killed, uh, the gentleman that came from Utah to watch the tennis --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah|b
And I guess they got convicted, the four, of --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
So you've come to a definite opinion on it now?|qy^d
Well, I, -|%
I've -|%
it, it seems like it's gone, gotten carried away,|sv
um, and I, I do find it hard to dr-, know where to draw a line,|sd
and so if I had to draw a line, I'd say just no capital punishment.|sd
I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't see that it accomplishes a whole lot, whereas I do think that convicting people and, and incarcerating them for a long time, if that could be improved upon, that would have more impact, I think.|sv
Yeah.|aa
You kind of hate to, -|bf
No,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
wh-, what about the argument where, where somebody who is committing one capital crime chooses to commit a, a more serious capital crime?|qh
I mean, murder, um, because that one at least, you might escape from because his victim, you know, his witnesses will be gone|sv
Doesn't this, doesn't this encourage,|qy
You mean --|qy
Doesn't this, yeah, I mean, doesn't this encourage murder, in order to wipe out the --|qy
The witnesses?|^2
Well, maybe it would.|no
Uh, I kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment, uh, as it is.|sd
I think that people who, uh, infringe on other people's rights, uh, and screw up their whole lives with rape, uh, child molesting, uh, terrorism, just uh, -|sv
Yeah.|b
There's just like five things that I think they ought to be snuffed for,|sv
but I'm, I'm for it for certain reasons.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I think that things like rape, uh, you can't get over, uh, it takes a lifetime.|sv
I see,|b
so, so if, if William Kennedy Smith had been found guilty, you believe he should have been, uh, executed?|qy^d
Uh, if it was,|arp_nd
A six person jury could have decided either way, of course|sd
If it was, it would probably have to be a pattern.|sv
You know, we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out, do the same thing and go back,|sd
and, uh, if they're habitual, like three times caught for rape or child molesting --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, the problem is that they've just been let out of jail.|sv
Pardon?|br
The problem there is that they've been let out jail.|sv
If they've been thrice convicted, they should have been kept in longer.|sv
Yeah,|aa
but we don't seem to keep them long enough,|sv
and then they learn such bad things in jail.|sv
That isn't --|sv
Yeah,|b
well. -|%
Yeah,|aa
that's, that's for sure.|aa
Yeah,|aa
it's a tough question, isn't it, on whether, at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can't afford to keep them around to --|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Yeah.|ny
Uh, let's see,|^h
so the other question that they wanted was whether the place that we live in, uh, compares to how we feel|sd
What's the laws there in D C?|qw
Uh, it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year|sv
but, uh, it's, it's camping.|sd
Really.|b
When was the last time you went?|qw
The last time I went camping was about, uh, in the middle of October,|sd
and we went up to Lake Bonham and really enjoyed it.|sd
Had a real good time with the family.|sd
We do an awful lot of camping.|sd
How about yourself?|qo
Well, I haven't been in probably about three years.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And the last time we went was in, um, well, I guess it was, it was like hunting season,|sd
and we went down to like a hunting ground and a lake --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yes, oh,|b
Very good.|ba
I bet it's pretty over there.|sv
It is real pretty.|sd
Um, let's see. -|^h
What do you think, what kind of --|qw
Do you do a lot of fishing?|qy
Do you go out,|qy
and is camping for you in a motor home, or a trailer,|qy
or do you actually put up a tent|qrr
or, -|%
One of the ones that you pull along --|sd
Oh, okay,|bk
so you have, -|bf
-- and then pop-u-, is it pop-up?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Pop-up.|b
A pop-up trailer, huh.|qy
Yeah.|ny
What do you have?|qw
We have a tent.|sd
A tent?|br
Yes|ny
So I guess we really rough it.|sd
Really.|b
And we really enjoy that.|sd
Uh, one thing, uh, I've done all sorts of camping.|sd
I've, I've camped, uh, in the snow on a glacier.|sd
I've camped, uh, basically almost anywhere, even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that, that camping trip and had to pack it back out.|sd
So you're a serious camper.|bf
Well, we enjoy it, yeah.|aa
But since I've been married and with a family, uh, we have to go where there's restrooms|sd
Well, that makes sense.|ba
so, we really enjoy it.|sd
But also while I was growing up, we did have a trailer,|sd
and, uh, I camped in that trailer and in a tent and in, in log cabins and so forth too.|sd
So a lot of different things.|sd
And yes,|%
I, -|%
to answer your questions earlier, yes, I, we do enjoy fishing,|sd
and I do go fishing.|sd
Haven't done a whole lot down here.|sd
We recently moved from the Rocky Mountain area up in, uh, northern Utah down to here because of work, and, uh, haven't been able to enjoy fishing like I used to up there, which is, uh, clear water fishing and streams and, and rivers.|sd
But when you all went camping is that what you normally, I mean, -|qy
what did you normally do?|qw
We normally, yeah, -|sd
we did, we did a lot of the fishing,|sd
but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and, and just going out and seeing what there was to see, uh, in the area.|sd
I guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with where, what you're going to do when you go,|sv
and you do actually camp.|sd
Oh, yes.|aa
That's true,|aa
that's true.|aa
Did you ever like travel around to what's that, the little K O, K O A camps whenever -- -|qy
we --|sd
-- ever done that?|qy
They -|%
although I've stayed in K O A campgrounds, uh, we've never done that just to go around and camp.|sd
Um, personally, I, when I, when we were growing up and when we were going camping, I thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground.|sd
Yeah.|b
Um, you know, that was mainly for people in motor homes or, or had trailers or, and so on and so forth, where, you know, we really wanted to go camping in a tent --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, K O A is, is geared for the people that have a hookup.|sd
That actually travel, what, city to city, state to state.|bf
Right,|aa
exactly,|aa
and, uh, I started out basically camping when I was, when I was in Boy Scouts,|sd
and we did an awful lot of that as, as a Boy Scout group.|sd
As I mentioned earlier, we went into wilderness areas|sd
and we camped in the snow, and in, uh, snow caves,|sd
and, and, uh, -|%
That's probably where I first started, was in Girl Scouts.|sd
All right.|b
And you got a lot of that in, huh?|qy
Yeah|ny
What do you like to do when you go camping?|qw
Um, well, let's see. I just, I mean, I just like to go|sd
and, normally I go with a whole group of friends --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff.|sd
Enjoy it, huh|qy
Roast marshmallows.|sd
Tell scary, or scary stories around the fire|bf
and, -|%
Yeah,|aa
or, um, take a deck of cards if we can actually see and, um, play cards and stuff.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
You know, lots, a lot of people I've talked to have said, well, isn't camping boring?|sd
Don't you get, don't you, uh, get bored and not have anything to do,|^q
but I've found out that actually we, we really enjoy getting away from the television, the telephone --|sd
Yeah,|aa
it's relaxing.|sv
-- and, yes.|aa
Exactly.|aa
Get out, -|sd
getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping.|sd
Plus, you, um, -|%
kind of makes you appreciate some, a lot of the things you take for granted.|sv
Yeah|aa
Running water --|sd
Running water --|b^m
-- your hair dryer --|sd
-- and a private bathroom.|^2
-- curling iron.|sd
Yes|aa
What about your family.|qo
Do your kids and everything like to?|qy
Yes,|ny
they really do, they have a great time,|sd
and like I mentioned, uh, the, we, we've been camping a couple of times this year|sd
and the last time was in October|sd
and we went up to Lake Bonham,|sd
and there was a playground for them|sd
so they had swings,|sd
Um,|%
So you have a son?|qy^d
I have an older son,|na
yeah.|ny
He doesn't have any children yet though.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, he's thirty-seven|sd
and I don't know if he's ever going to have any or not,|sd
but I do have some neighbor kids, lots of little neighbor kids.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That, -|%
I go out and, uh, I play ball with them.|sd
You know, it's, because like this one that lives right next door, her mother does some work at home --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her. Which is kind of sad, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
So the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them.|sd
So I will go out and play catch with them or you know, we ha-, let the dogs outside|sd
and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs|sd
but, uh, actually I do think that the parents should have, you know, a little bit more time to spend with their kids.|sv
I would think so.|aa
When you, -|%
when, when your son was at home did you, uh, working? -|qy
Did you work|qy
or were you able to stay at home with him?|qrr
No,|nn
when my son was at home, I, I did work|sd
and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but we always had our days off together|sd
and we went camping on vacations.|sd
So we had a lot of time together that way you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well when my mom, uh, -|sd
when I was growing up my mom worked too,|sd
but she worked nights --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and so she was always home for us --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I always, I really appreciated that. Having her there when I was, you know, when I came home from school and when I worked,|sd
but now when I look back at it, it must have been a really difficult thing that she did --|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh yeah.|aa
Well I am sure it was, you know.|sv
But, uh, I don't know what the families are going to come to now days because they, there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids.|sv
Because most, most of them, the father and mother both work, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, it's really rough.|sv
Uh, I have one neighbor that's, uh, the father is a fireman|sd
and he works like four days on|sd
and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days,|sd
but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family, you know.|sd
So, he's got a second job.|sd
Um.|b
So he's, you know he's not home very often.|sd
Yeah.|b
And that's, you know, -|%
the kids I know miss that.|sd
They really do.|aa
You know.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Uh, a family without a father, it's, it's, uh a really hard thing.|sv
Yeah, you know|aa
and I don't know,|h
I, I suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because, you know, he is out working trying to make some money for, you know, we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, -|%
Kids, I think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway.|sv
Oh, I am sure they would you know.|aa
So, are you planning on, to having any children|qy
or, -|%
Oh yeah.|ny
Oh yeah.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But we are, -|%
we just got married like, like December,|sd
so we are going to wait a year.|sd
Um. Yeah.|b
And,|sd
Well that's good.|ba
That's what my uh, daughter-in-law told me. That they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they will be married nine years|sd
So, I don't know.|h
She's a nurse, you know|sd
and, uh, she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids,|sd
so maybe they just decided that, uh, if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's a possibility.|sv
You know.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
But, uh, -|%
Well, We really want to have a family.|sd
We feel like that, that couple you know, you are not giving enough of yourself|sd
and --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
so, -|%
Right.|b
Right.|b
Right.|b
Give them, give them an edge,|sv
but, we feel like, like the first year needs to be devoted to, uh, making the family, the couple strong --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Right.|b
But then, a family is, is definitely a high priority.|sd
Yeah,|b
uh, do you plan on staying home after you have your children|qy
or do you, do you work or what?|qrr
Well, well I, uh, I am in, I am in a different situation.|sd
I am a missionary --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I am home on furlough.|sd
It called, like -|sd
I have worked for four years in Africa|sd
and I come home for a year.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And then we go back for four years.|sd
But my husband and I will do the same job|sd
and we will be living in, in Africa|sd
and we will be working together.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, uh, we will, we will share the job of raising the family.|sd
I mean as a mother I will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have|sd
but, still we will share that job.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But we have, -|%
then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling, like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- or do you send them away to boarding school|^q
and if you do that when do you do it|^q
and that's a, -|%
Uh, do you have a pet Randy?|qy
Uh, yeah,|ny
currently we have a poodle.|sd
A poodle, miniature or, uh, full size?|qy
Yeah,|ny
uh, it's, uh miniature.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
I read somewhere that, the poodles is one of the, the most intelligent dogs, uh, around.|sd
Well, um, I wouldn't, uh, I definitely wouldn't dispute that,|sd
it, it's actually my wife's dog, uh, I, I became part owner six months ago when we got married,|sd
but, uh, it, uh, definitely responds to, uh, to authority|sd
and, I've had dogs in the past|sd
and, uh, it seems, it seems to, uh, respond real well,|sd
it, it -|%
she's, she's picked up a lot of things, uh, just, just by, uh, teaching by force, I guess is what I'd like to say.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
So, you, you've only known the dog, wh-, how long did you say.|qw
Well, about a year I guess.|sd
Oh, well, uh, is it, -|qy
uh, uh, how old is the dog?|qw
It just turned two, I believe.|sd
Oh, it's still just a pup.|bf
Pretty much,|aa
yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Yeah,|b
I have a, uh, well a mutt, myself.|sd
I call it a, uh, uh, Chowperd .|sd
Okay.|b
It's, uh, part Chow and part Shepherd|sd
and it, -|%
as I understand it, uh, both sides of the, were thoroughbreds. -|sd
So, she's a genuine Chowperd .|sd
Oh, that sounds interesting.|ba
She has the, the color and the black to-, tongue of a Chow,|sd
but, uh, she has the shap-, the shape of the, uh, uh, Shepherd.|sd
Oh, that's, that's neat.|ba
How, about how big then?|qw
Oh, she weighs in at about fifty pounds,|sd
so she's a medium size.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Most definitely.|aa
Yeah.|b
and right from day one, she was teaching me.|sd
Oh, I wouldn't doubt it,|aa
yeah.|aa
She's the most intelligent dog I've ever seen.|sd
Course, I'm a little prejudiced, of course.|sd
Well that's understandable,|ba
yeah,|%
it's, uh, -|%
You know, the first time I brought her home, she was only, uh, was it six weeks old.|sd
And I spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, next morning, she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom.|sd
Okay.|b
So, on next night, I spread the newspaper in the bathroom|sd
and she used them there.|sd
Oh.|b
But it wasn't too long until she, uh, found out she could wait until I let her out in the morning.|sd
Yeah.|b
And since then, I, I live alone,|sd
Okay.|b
and, uh, I live in motor home,|sd
by the way, I'm, uh, an R V, full time R V -er,|sd
and it's, it's such a pleasure to come home at night|sd
and you can see her smiling from ear to ear, she's so happy to see me.|sd
Yeah,|aa
definitely.|aa
And, uh, I don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
I can honestly say we do, uh, we, uh, just recently put a security system in our house|sd
and so now, uh, in order to, uh, to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her, uh, uh, locked up in the, the master bedroom during the day|sd
and then she's got the, the bedroom and the bathroom to, for free run during the day|sd
but,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
She's definitely ready to get out and run around.|sd
Really.|b
Uh, she'd rather sle-, sleep outside on the, the cold ground at night.|sd
Oh wow.|ba
But, uh, I do make her come in.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I feed her indoors, that's to lure her in,|sd
but during the day I have her on a, uh, on a leash,|sd
Okay.|b
I have a, a thirty foot cable,|sd
Okay.|b
and then attached to that is a, uh, twelve foot leash,|sd
Okay.|b
so she can cover quite an area.|sd
Most definitely.|aa
And, uh, she's the best, uh, burglar alarm going.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
yeah|aa
that's, uh, definite security involved in, uh, in a dog like that.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
she, uh, -|%
it's the strangest thing, though, uh, children, no matter how strange they are, or how new they might be can walk, uh, right up to her,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but adults, if they're strange to her, or, or they look suspicious or something, boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off.|sd
Wow.|ba
And I have not discovered yet where the, the line is between children and adults.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's interesting.|ba
But, uh, she is a great comfort to me.|sd
Yeah,|b
I know our dog has had, uh, some different reactions,|sd
she's never really been around children|sd
and, uh, if, if the child is, is pretty straight forward, um, she's fine.|sd
If, if a child is a little intimidated, she'll jump around and, and yip and bark quite a bit,|sd
and if the child gets scared, uh, she's still trying to play, but she doesn't completely understand what's going on|sd
and we've had a little confusion with, with, uh, with younger kids.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, you know, that's, -|%
it's a matter of exposure really.|sv
Um, we, uh, took her home to, uh, my family's place in South Dakota,|sd
and she was the one that was intimidated then.|sd
There was about seven kids ranging from about, uh, three years to ten years running around the house all at one time,|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
and, the dog kind of, kind of felt out of place then because she was, she was being fed, and everything else from all directions.|sd
She really didn't know how to handle herself.|sd
You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention.|bf
She really did,|ar
she just, uh, -|%
she, she was alm-, she was just inundated with, with all the attention.|sd
Uh, she, she kind of, she kind of sat and it all in for a little while -|sd
and then she'd go get back in and try to play and, and what not,|sd
but, uh, it was, it was just such a, such a new experience for her.|sd
She's only been around one and, and sometimes two people at the most|sd
so, uh. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
What's her name by the way?|qw
Uh, pardon?|br
What, what do you call the dog?|qw
Oh, it's, uh, Mitzi.|sd
Mitzi.|b^m
Yeah.|aa
Mine is Gin.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
As in, uh, martini.|sd
Yeah.|b
Actually, it's Gin two.|sd
I, I see.|bk
Because, uh, when I was a teenager, in high school, I had Gin one,|sd
but then when I went out in the world, I couldn't take her with me.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
I had, uh, a similar, uh, experience.|sd
I, I grew up on a farm|sd
so I always had, uh, outdoor pets|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And he was a real, a real lovable type,|sd
Oh yeah.|b
so he, uh, he had to stay home.|sd
Oh, what a shame.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
it really was.|sd
He, uh, apparently had a tough time with it for a little while|sd
and then he, he got, he came to accept the fact that Mom and Dad were his company from then on,|sd
but, uh. -|%
Uh-huh,|b
oh well.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yeah.|b
Well Randy, we've just about used up our time here,|sd
Okay.|aa
and I must say it was interesting.|sv
Most definitely.|aa
I enjoyed talking about pets with you.|sv
Well that's great.|ba
Maybe we'll get together again in the future.|fc
That sounds real good.|fc
Take care now.|fc
You too.|fc
Bye.|fc
All right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Amy, how are you doing today?|fp
Fine,|fp
fine.|fp
All right,|b
I think we know what we're going to speak about.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, I tell you what, I'll start off.|oo_co_cc
How's that?|qw
Okay,|aa
you go ahead.|ad
Um, I personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
In public places.|^2
There is one state that does that, by the way.|sd
Really?|bh
What is that?|qw
I want to say Oklahoma,|sd
I saw something the other night about it.|sd
Um.|%
They don't do them real often.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Um, but I think if we quit, uh, building, these Taj Mahals with the color T V -s and sixty dol-, sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a, on a, on a life sentence, we should start hanging them and get it over with|sv
and let's just screwing up the system.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, the sentences are so unbelievable.|sv
I just saw on the news last night, that they said the average time a sentenced murderer, you know, is in jail is two years before he's paroled, and a rapists is like six months,|sd
That's pathetic.|sv
That's pathetic.|sv
Because they just say there's either no room in the system, you know, in the jails for them|sd
or, you know, it's just that, it seems like the automatic sentences, if, if a judge has leeway, on what he's going to, you know, sentence someone for between, you know, two months and fifty years and, you know, what's his whim to decide it should be two months.|sv
This is true,|aa
You know, it's crazy.|sv
an, and the way the law reads, uh, if they sentence you to life in prison, then he's available for parole.|sd
If it's life and a day, then he's not eligible for parole.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, what, you know, -|%
let's quit B S -ing with the system.|sv
Well even if it's life, like you say, we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some, you know, joker in there for life.|sd
We could spend that money, you know, for children that are starving, or twelve million other things would be more useful than that.|sv
Exactly.|aa
So to me if somebody has life, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt they should, that should be it.|sv
A life for a life.|bf
You know particularly for some of these really, I mean, -|sv
there are so many just major, major serial murders,|sv
it's not just like one instance, or something, it's just, uh, horrifying, some of the murders that go on.|sv
The old Charles Manson case.|sd
I mean the guy is really,|sv
Yeah,|aa
an, -|%
yeah,|aa
there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, about the issue about sentencing by the judge. -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
The, the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene, uh, when there's a, my understanding, when there's uh, a verdict|sd
and it -|%
for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth, today, in eight to four|sd
and bam, bam the guy got off.|sd
Uh, he was, he was a veterinarian, and killed two, a father and a son, okay.|sd
Right,|aa
yeah,|aa
I heard about that on the news.|sd
Uh, it kind of gets back to the second request,|sd
we've been asked to look at, is most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict.|sd
In a situation like that, I'd say no,|sd
let's just go like a regular vote.|^q
Eight to four tells me that there were eight,|sd
there's a certain perc-, percentage of the people there, with sixty percent of the people, uh, seventy percent of the people said, hey,|sd
Right.|b
Rather than have to retrial the whole, whole thing and spend all the money for people to, uh, you know, go back to court and all the lawyers|sv
and, I mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a, you know, a fortune to keep doing that.|sv
Exactly.|aa
And the victims, you know, the family of these people that have been murdered, they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution.|sv
Exactly,|aa
because it's not next day they have, the, start the trial, it's X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more.|bf
Right,|aa
yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
I think that, that if it's, if it's not a split decision, go with the highest number|sv
and let's just get on with the program.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
But as far as the sentencing by the judge, I would have to vote against that since there is a jury, because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
Uh, what are your feelings?|qo
Well if I, -|%
I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge, I believe from Florida,|sd
and she just has, just really stiff penalties|sd
and I saw that in, in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really, you know, took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved, it could, you could have a, a judge that would really make a good impact.|sd
But likewise, you could have the flip side, and have some judge that was paid off or, you know, had go-, a good old boy network|sv
or for whatever reasons, you know, politics, just let all kinds of people through|sv
so, he, he would have a heck, or she would have a heck of a lot of power, you know, if used wrongly.|sv
So at least the jury system does something to prevent that, you know, or help it with it anyway.|sv
I don't know if it prevents it,|sd
but, seems like the jury system does have it's advantages.|sv
But I also, I've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient, you know,|sd
and I don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers, at that point, they're really getting a select group.|sd
It's not just random people.|sd
Um.|%
It almost should be the first twelve people that they, you know, have on a list are the ones that are on the jury|sv
and that's it.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I get back to Price's comment when he, uh, was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks, uh, you know, from his neck of the woods.|sd
Well give me a break, you know.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
He'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something,|sv
yeah.|%
Exactly,|aa
yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
I mean you're, you're in Dallas|sd
so everybody, -|sd
I can't believe they can, -|sd
uh, like in a murder situations, they look for juries who don't know anything about the system, well or know anything about the, the occurrence,|sd
you'd have to be pretty dense,|sv
Yeah.|b
you'd be, you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on, or moving it to Lubbock,|sv
Yeah.|b
Oh, they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically.|sv
This is true, so true.|aa
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Well this has been an interesting conversation.|sv
Well, really, this is, breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors, I mean,|sd
what can I say.|qh
So, you're at the house you're not at the plant.|bf
No,|aa
I'm at home with two little ki-, preschoolers.|sd
My husband works for T I.|sd
Oh, that's good,|ba
that's good.|ba
I thought I heard a holler there in the background,|sd
but I wasn't sure.|sd
Oh yeah,|aa
I've got the dog and two kids waiting here,|sd
I'm just locked up in the laundry room|sd
Oh goodness,|ba
well, I'll let you get, -|oo_co_cc
Okay,|aa
thanks a lot.|ft
Bye-bye.|fc
I enjoyed it.|fc
Bye.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy? and background|qw
Well, as a matter of fact, I was thinking about that the other day,|sd
and, uh, I really don't know the answer,|sd
uh, I would sort of like to, uh, think about something in the way of, uh, uh, sort of a sporty car but not any, not, you know, a luxury type sporty one.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, um, something that still has a lots of amenities and, you know, gadgets and things.|sd
Oh, you do want a lot of that stuff?|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
well, yeah|ny
I like, I like some of those things.|sd
They come in really handy sounds in|sd
What kind of, uh, things are you going to consider,|qw
you know, what, uh, you said something about the, about the, -|sd
well, what do you call them,|t1
you said amenities,|sd
Amenities.|b^m
but what about, um, their reputation of the company or the price.|qw
Yeah,|b
well, of course, I guess, uh, price is always the big consideration,|sv
but, -|%
It is for me,|sd
other people,|sv
yeah.|b
Well, that's, that's a big one in my book,|sd
Yeah.|b
but, uh, um, I have preferences for, uh, for some, uh, makers over others, um,|sd
and I would sort of like to buy American,|sd
Yeah.|b
but, you know, I'm not so totally hung up on that, that I wouldn't buy something else,|sd
how about you?|qo
Well, um, the last car we bought was American because of, because of that reason,|sd
but have not been entirely happy with, uh, several things about the car, -|sd
it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Because several things, minor things sort of, -|sd
but still they cost us money, um, that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car that, that was that new,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
we bought the car new|sd
and after, -|%
um, well, well, well under two years we had to replace the clutch.|sd
Oh.|b
And, they just said, well, you know, clutches are disposable ,|sd
and I said, since when?|sd
Yeah.|b
Brake pads are disposable ,|sd
Yeah.|b
we know that,|sd
but I never thought a clutch was disposable.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I wouldn't have thought so either.|sd
Yeah,|aa
so that was, that was kind of a shock|sd
Oh.|b
Yeah,|b
I, I guess there's a lot to, to think about when you're trying to make that decision.|sv
Yeah,|aa
you know, the less actually, the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars, -|sv
they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like, like, uh, uh, a Mercedes Benz,|sd
they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable.|sd
Right.|b
You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes,|sv
No|aa
but then, -|%
No,|aa
but on the other hand, I guess, too, uh, whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune.|sd
Really?|bh
Oh I don't know.|h
Yeah,|b
I've, uh, worked with a couple of people who have owned, uh, various years, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, even though they do a lot of the work themself then just buying the parts and everything is, is pretty expensive.|sd
But for them it's, it's sort of a hobby, too,|sd
Yeah.|b
What kind of, -|qw
what brand of car are you thinking about buying|qw
or like what things are you looking at?|qw
Well, I haven't re-, really gotten that far with it, um,|sd
I've always sort of liked General Motors,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but, uh, oh, I guess, I really don't know.|h
How come -|%
I've been kind of, um, -|sd
I guess the commercials are getting to me, the Toyota commercials,|sd
Yeah.|b
and I know that a lot of people I've, I've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them, that hardly had any problems at all.|sd
Yeah,|b
that, -|%
I think that's, -|%
I think they have a really good, uh, quality.|sv
Uh-huh.|aa
My, uh, daughter has owned two different ones,|sd
and, uh, you know, we've had some work done on them|sd
but it's not too bad,|sd
and the reason, -|%
one of the reasons we, um, bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years|sd
and he lived way out in the country|sd
so he put a lot of miles on it,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, you knew it had, had been through a whole lot,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and yet, you know, it, it held up pretty doggone good,|sd
so,|sd
Yeah.|b
They seem to be really durable.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, I don't know,|h
I'm, I'm not ready to buy a new car yet,|sd
but I don't know, if, if the next time I'm going to try to, to stay with buying something American or if I'm going to go for a little more, what I would consider to be a long-term investment|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, -|%
and I guess, you know, you always have to think about things like, your gas mileage and stuff like that, you know, -|sv
you ... -|%
Oh, it's easy to get gas mileage in this car,|sd
Yeah|b
it gets excellent gas mileage.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's one of the big throwing cards for, some of the foreign ones like one music|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, we talked long enough|ad
I think so.|aa
Okay,|b
well, enjoyed it.|fc
All righty,|fc
thanks and background|ft
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
well, go ahead,|ad
I'll let you start.|oo_co_cc
Uh, I was thinking about whether or not we should have people, uh, be required to do public service for a year or two.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family,|sd
or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to.|sd
I mean, you can't make it everybody.|sv
Right,|aa
yeah.|aa
But then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and, and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
or it could be like the draft where, you know, before they draft you, they ta-, uh, you get a physical anyway.|sv
So when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical -|sv
and if there's nothing physically wrong with you, then you're drafted.|sv
It doesn't matter how rich you are.|sv
That would be good.|aa
And then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members,|sv
right.|^g
What did you say?|br
Give physicals to the rest of the family members|sv
and they all had to pass.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
Uh.|%
Uh, I thought it a good idea too, though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
that's true.|aa
And, uh, if they did this, maybe help them out in their college cost|sv
and maybe they could pay people for doing this, at least something,|sv
so they co-, could subsist.|sv
Well that's true.|aa
America's paying all this money to have other people give, uh, aid to other countries,|sd
so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time.|sv
Yeah.|b
Because, actually, when you, when you do, uh, service overseas you end up learning something, usually that's, that's really useful, plumbing, or farming, or, or something like that,|sd
so you're really learning a skill|sd
Yeah,|b
and you know all these old people, they would get out of this right.|sv
All the ones that are already retired. -|sd
So what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country.|sv
What did you say?|br
Uh-huh.|%
I'm just teasing|sd
Yeah,|b
I, I, think, well that's probably the idea,|sv
I don't know whether the idea is to be within the country, or outside the country.|sd
Well I thought it would be a good idea if maybe you took some of the kids and had them go over to other countries|sv
and children from their countries came over to ours too, a trade off.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that would be neat,|sv
yeah|aa
sort of like an exchange program.|bf
Yeah.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
And other than that, I can't think of any other ideas.|sd
Yeah,|b
that'd be sort of neat.|sv
I like the idea of, uh, being, uh, a mandatory thing for welfare.|sd
Course that's what, um, -|%
that's sort of like what Truman had,|sd
or was it Roosevelt,|qrr
I can't remember, um,|sd
with the big, -|sd
Oh with W P A.|bf
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|b
Getting people, uh, -|%
the, the work program and all the, all the make work jobs.|sd
That was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building.|sd
And we're still using those things too.|sd
What did you say?|br
We're still using those things.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's true a lot of them are still out there.|sd
Like all these wonderful highways in West Virginia and no one knows why.|sd
They built lodges before too, like at Caddo Lake.|sd
Lake what?|br
Caddo Lake.|sd
Caddo Lake.|b^m
It's between Texas and Louisiana,|sd
it crosses into both of them.|sd
No,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I've never heard of it.|sd
Well, it's real pretty,|sv
it's like a swamp.|sd
Oh|b
You know with all the Spanish moss on the trees, it's really, it's eerie.|sd
Oh okay,|bk
real pretty, like a swamp,|b^m
oh yeah.|%
Yeah.|b
Oh, okay,|bk
yeah,|b
I been, uh, -|%
I got, uh, talked to someone else before that was a, uh, a Texan,|sd
but I guess that's, uh, that's what we're going to have.|sd
This is, uh, a T I experiment to see how talk,|sd
Texans talk to other people.|sd
I don't know,|sd
where are you from?|qw
Uh, Virginia.|sd
Virginia,|b^m
oh, that's neat,|ba
I talked to somebody from Ohio the other night.|sd
Oh yeah,|aa
it is neat to get other people. Especially since you got other, uh, ideas about how people, uh, how people react to things and stuff. Especially when it comes to, um, social services.|sv
Uh, uh, I'm glad they have a lot of, uh, um, you know, topics on social services, because, like this thing, this is a pretty good idea.|sd
I didn't even know if they were thinking about it.|sd
I wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone, somewhere is really thinking, that, uh, it would be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service.|qy
There is somebody|sd
and I, , uh, I can't remember who it is|sd
but there's a really famous, -|sd
of dang, -|ba
I can't remember.|sd
Politicians pushing it, or, uh --|bf
That proposed it,|sd
I read something in PEOPLE about it.|sd
Huh.|br
Mitch Snider, I don't know who Mitch Snider is.|sd
Oh, okay,|bk
well see that's a D C thing.|sd
Mitch Snider is the, the advocate for the homeless that, uh, he, he's said it out here in Washington|sd
but he started the um, uh, the movement for creative nonviolence.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
he started that|sd
and that, that was basically a, you know, donate time and money to, uh, help the homeless, -|sd
but, uh.|%
What have your other topics been?|qw
the other topic was, like I said, uh, something about politicians.|sd
I can't remember exactly what it was.|sd
It was real general statement|sd
I had one that I hated.|sd
It was what meal would you cook for, uh, uh special dinner|sd
Gee whiz|ba
yeah.|%
How far can you go with that one,|qh
right.|%
Yeah.|b
Another one, though, that was good was, uh, what do you think about the social changes for the last ten, twenty and thirty years|sd
and what do you think has caused some of the social problems.|^q
Uh-huh,|b
that would be neat.|sv
I'd have to basically say my birth. *humor|sd
That's probably the best one.|sv
And we had to talk about air pollution too.|sd
What do you think is causing it|^q
and what should we do about it?|^q
Uh-huh.|b
Well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other countries, I mean other parts of the state, you know, -|sv
of course Pittsburgh, would say, you know, oh, find the better cheaper ways of burning coal, you know.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
right.|aa
Cleaner ways of burning coal -|^q
and people in the South would say don't burn coal, you know.|sv
Because we don't have much coal.|^2
Oh we have a lot of coal|ar
In Virginia.|sd
But, uh, it's, uh, it's a dirty fuel, that's for sure.|sv
Yeah,|aa
well how did you get into this program.|qw
Excuse me. How did I get into it, oh,|b
I'm an electrical engineer here in Virginia.|sd
For T I.|qy^d
No.|nn
No.|b^m
Uh, no,|nn
they, -|%
I'm in a telecommunications company|sd
and they, uh, sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers wanted to participate, you know. -|sd
So does your company have something to do with T I.|qy
Um, not really,|ng
I mean no more than any other company, you know,|sd
we buy their parts just as much as anybody else.|sd
But, uh, no, no real association with T I other than being in the same industry, electronics industry.|sd
Huh,|b
uh-huh.|%
They just, uh, they just sent out a letter to everybody they do business with saying, that you know, if you're interested we're doing a study|sd
and, and since, -|%
And do you know how much, how long this is supposed to go on.|qy
I don't know,|no
no|nn
I don't.|no
I don't either.|no
I mean it says just keep on until -|sd
and they'll notify you.|sd
At first I was thinking it was just a week because that's all it shows, you know, on the schedule|sd
but then it seems like it might be longer than a week.|sd
Right.|b
So what do you think we're going to get?|qw
What do you think,|br
what. -|%
What do you think we're going to get for this?|qw
Get.|br
Money,|qy
prizes.|qy
Oh, I don't know.|no
Do you know anybody that's ever done this?|qy
Get your own, you're going to get you own T I seven thirty-two or something.|sd
I know T I gets prizes.|sd
Oh, I didn't hear about that.|sd
Probably for T I employees.|sv
I was led to believe that if you weren't T I that you get money.|sd
I'm not T I.|sd
Oh, your not, - *typo your you're|bf
you don't work for Texas Instruments.|bf
Huh-uh.|aa
Oh, okay.|bk
Let's see, one of my friends had a roommate that worked for T I|sd
and she saw this on her computer --|sd
Oh.|b
so she ran off copies of the thing.|sd
Oh.|b
And I just signed up for it.|sd
Oh, oh, that's a neat idea.|ba
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|b
well he's gotten a good mix.|sd
I was saying because I've, -|sd
like I said, I heard some other people talking that they've talked to different people in different states and stuff.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's good, especially since you call that one eight hundred number|sv
so, so probably knock T I profits margin way down. -|sv
And it shouldn't be too good right now anyway, because they've been laying off so many people.|sv
Yeah|aa
right,|aa
this is probably some government study program.|sd
Yeah|aa
really,|aa
so we're footing the bill on our taxes.|sv
Okay.|b
Okay,|b
well I enjoyed talking with you.|fc
Okay,|b
well thanks a bunch,|ft
we'll talk to you later,|fc
bye.|fc
I'm going to save my two year old from the pile of grapes she's diving into.|sd
Well I'm going to try to clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around.|sd
Okay|b
we'll I'll talk to you.|fc
Bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Hello.|fp
Hello|fp
I was, I was thinking about our topic for the night Um, immigration problems.|sd
We have immigration problems|sd
and what do, do you think about it?|qo
Well, I think it's a very, very complicated,|sv
Huh.|b
and I sort of, I see perspectives on all sides.|sd
Um, and I've re-, have no hope for solutions.|sd
But, uh, I do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue.|sd
I have worked with, uh, uh, a little bit with refugees from,|sd
And seen, you know, heard about some of the problems that they've had.|sd
And I'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be.|sd
Because I, in general, like a smaller rather than a larger population,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh,|sd
Where are you?|qw
See, -|%
Well, we've got a lot too.|sd
I'm in Texas.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
In Garland, right outside of Dallas.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
So, we're getting a large -|sd
oh, gosh, I don't know,|h
I think there's like twenty-six different languages now, that are spoken in I, the I S D. Dallas Innercity School District.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Cambodians, uh, Asians, Vietnamese. -|sd
We, we're getting a lot of, uh, Mexican Americans,|sd
you know, we've had,|sd
Yeah.|b
Sure,|b
well, Texas,|sd
Yes,|aa
oh, yes.|aa
to child in No,|t3
I'm busy right now, Steven.|t3
Steven wants me to do popcorn right now.|sd
Huh.|b
to Okay.|t3
And I don't know what the solution is.|sd
I, I don't either.|sd
It's a really delicate, uh, moral, issue.|sv
Because, i-, if you have, well, -|%
I guess the one thing I do see that is, is that needs to be a solution is, that if you do let people into the country, I do feel you have a certain obligation to,|sd
To get them on their, -|^2
Yeah.|b
Because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in|sv
and you're, you're dooming them to being underclass people.|sv
Right,|b
You know, you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever.|sv
And I know that, that the Southeast Asians, the Hmong people that I've done some work with, uh, feel very quite hurt and, and unsure of themselves when here.|sd
Because they're coming from, you know, from the slash and burn intercultural society, you know,|sd
they're coming from the middle ages, basically.|sd
And they're being plunked down, plunked down into America.|sd
Many of them had been promised by the C I A, during the war over there, that because they co-operated with the C I A, and they helped the C I A out, that when they came here, the C I A would help establish them in America,|sd
and the C I A, of course, isn't doing that.|sd
Um.|%
And, uh, so they come here|sd
and they don't know wh-, what the heck they're doing.|sd
And they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities.|sd
And, of course, there are people in the big cities who would do, like nothing better than to take advantage of them.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And they're, they're incredible victims of crime.|sd
And part of it is this lack of,|sd
And I'm not saying it's easy to do,|sd
and I know there are a few people who are trying,|sd
but, but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on.|sd
And there's a lot of graft, like people trying to tell them, oh, giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it.|sd
Uh, yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
Y-, -|%
ha-, -|%
Yeah.|b
I mean, these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what America's like.|sd
Right.|b
Um, and it's, -|%
ver- -|%
it's, -|%
I, I couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until I, until I met with them.|sd
And I realized that, they, some of the information that I just, you know, don't even realize and know is information, they don't have.|sd
And I never thought, well, I guess that is something you need to know, you know.|sd
People getting into trouble because they come here,|sd
and so they start farming on, uh, available land, you know. Like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it.|sd
But then someone comes along and says you can't do that, you know.|sd
Why can't they?|qh
They have no idea why not, some, some of them, you know.|sd
The ones that have been here longer and have been in, you know, understand now.|sd
But when they initially come over, -|sd
You mean, really trying to plant something?|qy
That's what you're saying?|br
Yeah,|ny
Farming?|qy
'cause they're farmers.|sd
These,|sd
Oh.|b
and they're being put in the middle of the city|sd
Oh that's terrible.|ba
I mean they're nomadic farmers, you know,|sd
they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
These are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before. You know, these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war.|sd
And, uh, they have, you know. -|%
So I, I, I do have a lot of sympathy for them,|sd
and I feel that America could try a little bit harder to, to help people adjusting to the American way.|sd
Because if they don't, you're just going to produce, you know, you're going to produce an underclass, you know.|sv
You're going to get a situation that I think a lot like what happened to the blacks, being sort of led out of slavery|sv
and then, then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then.|sd
And there was no,|sd
And not being cared for. -|bf
And, not being, you know, -|%
Yeah.|aa
That's true.|aa
Um,|%
Well, what did you do when you helped these people?|qw
Well, -|%
How did you, what did you do,|qw
tru-, -|%
I, I wasn't helping them.|sd
I worked with them, not to help them, but for my own purposes.|sd
I'm, I'm a linguist|sd
and I was, uh, doing a language, trying to learn their language, a little bit.|sd
And I actually, um, I mean, helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me.|sd
But I didn't, I didn't, I wasn't a social worker or anything like that.|sd
All right.|bk
I do have friends who have tried to do more,|sd
Uh-huh|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Because all the models of teaching English are based on teaching English to Spanish speakers or to other European language speakers.|sd
And people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are.|sd
Well, I'm an E S L teacher.|sd
Oh, you are?|bh
Yes.|ny
Uh-huh,|b
well you, -|%
I got my certification.|sd
But actually they did not teach us very many things about how really to go about helping people to learn another language|sd
That's, that's been my impression.|sd
I mean, it's like people don't know, what they say,|sd
Yeah.|aa
It's, it's not, they're not withholding information,|sd
it's not step for step.|sd
they just don't have that information.|sd
Yeah|b
They, they haven't the foggiest idea.|sd
But anyway, I enjoy it.|sd
They, they, -|%
the kids I've worked with so far have been Spanish speaking.|sd
Yes.|b
And -|%
And Spanish is,|sv
but I'm applying for, -|sd
What?|br
Yeah,|aa
it is.|sv
And Spanish is a lot like English.|sv
A lot of our words are the same,|sv
Yeah.|b
like, you know,|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Yeah.|b
But, I love it.|sd
I love the culture, uh, the way that they, uh, they respect education and their teachers --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
and I like it.|sd
And what I've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this, uh, Asian center that, a Doctor Falk has started, that works with the school district.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And doing what, trying to get them set up, in-, inculturated,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I thought that would be good experience for me.|sd
Oh, I'm sure it would.|sv
And, I've applied at another district where many of the children are Asian.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And I think that would be wonderful too.|sd
Yeah,|aa
it would be a good experience,|sv
and you'd be helping people, I'm sure.|sv
Very much.|sv
And n-, and I mean, not to put, not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but I do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble.|sd
I mean, and part of the problem is that, a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from, you know, decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth.|sv
Right.|b
They became a very successful immigrant group.|sv
But, and, but a lot of people coming over from Vietnam, right now, coming from worn torn countries, are, are na-, not having the same success.|sv
I think some people have just assumed, well, why, why can't you be successful?|sv
The Japanese were, or the Chinese were, or something.|^q
And it's really much more complicated.|sv
Well, the times were different too.|sv
Yeah,|aa
the times are different, yeah.|b^m
My neighbor, let's see, is Jewish.|sd
And he's going through the, I don't know, the Jewish League or something.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And he spends, -|sd
well, right now, he's down to like once a week,|sd
but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And he thoroughly enjoyed it.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
I, I think it's a wonderful thing to do.|sv
And there's a lot, there's a lot more, -|sv
I guess another possible solution is, since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and, and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it, uh,|sv
No.|aa
Because everyone gains from it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Would be, -|%
would, -|%
might be really useful.|sv
Uh, and if it's, you know, uh, just people helping people I think makes, makes the community so much happier.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
What's so sad about this is both of the, the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers|sd
but,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
And because they're so deficient in English, they haven't been able to get jobs.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
So they'll have to go back and get a degree here. You know, almost start all over.|sd
Yes,|aa
yes,|aa
I've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country. I mean,|sd
and they're highly educated people,|sd
but of course, if you're educated and you don't speak English, no one thinks anything of you.|sd
No,|aa
no.|aa
And this woman was, uh, stocking the shelves in a drugstore.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
I feel sorry for her.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I do too.|sd
Well, It's been good talking with you.|fc
Well, thank you.|ft
Uh, okay.|fc
Have a good night.|fc
Okay,|fc
it does sound like you have some children to take care of|sd
Okay.|aa
Yes,|aa
I do|sd
Uh, Okay,|b
bye-bye.|fc
Okay,|fc
Bye.|fc
I just pressed my, uh. -|sd
We're supposed to talk about recent political developments.|sd
I got one that's interesting, not too, not too controversial,|sd
I, -|%
you know, not, -|%
doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican.|sd
I, I do get somewhat of a kick out of, -|sd
because Schwartzkopf, or the other generals, who I admire, how everyone wants to make, get them in politics. -|sv
I think --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I was wondering what you thought about that --|sd
Yeah.|b
They want him because he's popular, not because he can do the job.|sv
Right.|aa
Well, I've, I've been thinking about it,|sd
and I, uh, I kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero,|sd
those, -|%
we're looking for a hero.|sv
Well, TIME magazine was saying that in essence the general's staff was comparing to corporate presidents,|sd
and they said in general, generals are more familiar with training, that they believe in training more.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They are much more educated than the average corporate president,|sd
and so they really were very positive on a general's staff person having a, a very much better education than the average, uh, corporate president.|sd
So, I thought well, maybe.|sd
I, I think they probably have a better education than the average congressman.|sv
Well, that, too,|aa
that, too.|aa
And, uh, you know, they talk about the Army|sd
and because of the war|sd
and why did we win, and all that,|sd
and they talked about how the training was so important.|sd
And that's so important in industry,|sd
so, you know, they're liable to be right. That generals, generals in the service, -|sv
and Schwartzkopf, uh, you know, might make a good, uh, politician, whether it be Governor or whatever, you know.|sv
He, he, you know, we know he's a good leader,|sv
we know he's a good organizer.|sv
The question is, you know, can he be the man who's ultimately responsible.|sd
You know, like what he said is, you know, a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about, you know, people asking why are you doing this, why are you doing that.|sd
He says, I'm following the orders of my president.|sd
I'm not the one who writes the orders.|^q
I'm just the one who follows them.|^q
Yeah,|b
it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs, you know,|sv
everyone has a boss, of course.|sv
You know, Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait.|sd
Yeah.|b
And so he went to the President and said, okay, here's how I want to do it.|sd
But he wasn't the one that decided Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait.|sd
No,|aa
that's true,|aa
that's true.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, you, you pick one.|ad
I just thought of that one when, when they brought up about politics.|sd
That was, uh, pretty easy --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- you don't have to pick Democratic or Republican,|ad
you can pick anything you want,|ad
go ahead.|ad
Well, the thing that I'm wondering about is how we get a new congress.|sd
How do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long, -|qh
how do we get them to not get reelected over and over again.|qh
Well, I have an easy answer for that, oh, I wish they would do it, is that limit it, you know, to eight or ten years max.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, whether that's two --|sv
I th-, -|%
yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
That may be our only answer,|sv
but I don't really like it.|sd
I don't like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve.|sd
Oh, you know, you're not.|ar
I think if the President, be him Republican or Democrat, -|sd
I think if the President can prove that he's popular, you know, that he can do the job --|sv
Yeah.|b
I think the reason why we've got these guys in Congress is because of the fund raising rules.|sv
I mean, how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year, did they get after they were elected, just, you know, just after they were elected two years ago.|sv
Yeah.|b
Basically the people, -|sv
as soon as they get elected, the people dump all kinds of money on them and say, Yeah, yeah, you're my friend,|sv
you're my friend,|^q
and two years later he remembers that.|sv
And what they done is they've bought this congressman for two years.|sv
Yeah,|b
I don't know,|h
I do like the limitation of the President,|sd
and I think there is a needed change.|sv
I think the same thing should happen for Congress.|sv
I, I'd lik-, you know, -|%
that would be my answer of an --|sd
Yeah,|b
well. -|%
My God, it's ridiculous, you know.|sv
That's, that's the easy way.|sv
I think the harder way out would be to make the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground|sv
We had. -|%
That's what the financing rules and the, uh, the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff. -|sv
I think voting is, is a prob-, I think I had one of the subject about voting, and, uh, voting apathy, or something like that,|sd
and I think that, uh, the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time.|sv
I can't believe that a country our big votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning til seven o'clock at night, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
Of course they have absentee which is getting to be more, a lot easier,|sd
and I, I vote as often on absentee as I can because it's so easy now.|sd
But, I think, gee whiz, you could make it a couple days.|sv
It's just, if you really want the majority of the people to vote --|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, I think a lot more people could vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
You know, like, you know, the, the recent election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up, that election last December.|sv
Are you in Dallas?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I'm in Dallas city limit.|sd
Boy, I, I, I live in Arlington.|sd
I am so happy not to be part of Dallas --|sd
Yeah.|b
It's an ugly mess.|sv
I mean, I don't know if you like the mayor,|sd
but I think your mayor, -|sv
the city council, -|sv
the, -|%
what is the woman's name whose, us, not the mayor but the, - *typo should be who's|qw
The manager.|^2
Yeah,|aa
the city manager.|sd
All of them need to be thrown out.|sv
I mean, they're just awful, just awful.|sv
Well, what get's me is this thing, it went down to defeat last December by how many votes, by just a few hundred votes.|sd
Uh-huh|b
And if it, if it had passed, -|sv
if these people had gotten out the vote, it would have passed|sv
and there'd be no more argument.|sv
But they're still fighting about it because of the --|sv
I know.|aa
It's so awful that politicians always spent consulting money. That we put them in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy consultants,|sv
and then they don't even do that recommendation, you know.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
I mean, it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in.|sv
But, but this is for, supposedly to benefit the minorities,|sd
and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote --|sv
Well you're right there.|aa
-- and they would have had their way.|sv
You're right there.|aa
Uh, uh, people are, -|%
uh, uh, politics, uh, -|%
the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it's pretty sad.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it is.|sv
Uh, hopefully people will get more involved.|sd
My, my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going.|sd
Oh, yeah,|aa
but those are the ones that are complaining, I, I think, a lot.|sv
I see it here at T I.|sd
The guys that don't take any interest in, and, and constantly on the negative of everything.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh,|bh
And, and you ask them why they don't vote,|sd
they say well they don't want their name on the, uh, jury duty list.|sd
That, that's where they get the jury duty list, is from the voter registration.|sd
Right,|aa
you're right,|aa
you're right.|aa
I think they could do more about, uh, voting.|sv
I think they could.|sv
What are the issues?|qw
I, I'm a Democrat,|sd
I want to just say that I'm so sad that there isn't a strong Democrat.|sd
I don't even know,|h
I could go out and debate George Bush better than I see any Democrat doing it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, I mean, at least I'd like to see compe-, -|sd
because I like competition, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
I think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead, -|sv
I'm so disgusted with the Democratic party,|sd
I can not believe it, you know. *typo cannot|sd
In Presidential races that's about what they've done,|sv
but they've got a pretty good lock on Congress and --|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
but I still think in the last ten years, -|sv
you know, of course that's not a recent event,|sd
that's only my opinion,|h
I guess I really shouldn't talk about that.|h
But, I don't know whether they're recent events.|sd
I guess they we-, on this, uh, speech thing, they want us to use a variety of words.|sd
Right.|aa
How many times have you called, by the way?|qy
Actually, I haven't made any calls,|sd
but I received about a dozen.|sd
Oh, really, I, I, I, -|b
I think, yeah, I have to make these,|sd
but I get distracted and get to do something else,|sd
and all of a sudden my phone rings,|sd
and go, Well, what the heck, we'll talk for a while.|sd
Yeah,|b
I've already got twelve cards.|sd
You get any cards in the mail?|qy
Yeah,|ny
we got a whole bunch.|sd
I can't remember how many.|sd
I don't know,|h
I'm amazed by, -|sd
of course, we're not talking about politics,|sd
but I am amazed by, -|sd
people say they got thirty.|sd
Well, I wonder why you need thirty renditions of the persons voice,|sd
but I'm not in voice synthesis.|sd
But I'd sure like to see a summary of it.|sd
We'll get to politics, I'm sorry|sd
Well, I think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway.|sd
Yeah,|aa
right.|aa
We're supposed to do five minutes,|sd
and that was three minutes ago.|sd
Yeah.|b
Hey, well thanks for the call.|ft
Yeah,|fc
bye-bye.|fc
Yeah,|fc
bye.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
what are your favorite things to watch?|qy
Oh, uh, let's see,|^h
I, uh, I have enjoyed, uh, THIRTYSOMETHING --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, some comedy shows, uh, I can not, can not think of, off hand,|sd
Yeah.|b
but, what, what are your, -|qw
what is, -|qw
We do not watch a lot of T V,|sd
we try to watch it on Thursday nights,|sd
we usually watch L A LAW,|sd
I like that real well.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
-- we like to watch that.|sd
Uh, we sort of got hooked on LA LAW.|sd
Uh, do you ever watch that?|qy
Yeah,|ny
uh, yeah,|ny
yeah,|ny
we, we wa-, we try to catch that most, most nights.|sd
Yeah|b
And I, I have watched THIRTYSOMETHING some in the last couple seasons.|sd
I was sort of sorry to see it go --|sd
Yeah.|b
It, it was kind of interesting, uh, some people complained about, uh, uh, the kind of whining or whatever on it.|sd
I, I really did not think it, it was,|sd
Yeah.|b
I think it had some, some good, uh, good situations that it presented.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I thought a lot of the, -|sd
like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff, I can relate to some of those things.|sd
Yeah.|b
Just the dynamics of it and everything.|sd
Well, I think, I think a lot of people, you know, kind of felt that way,|sv
but they had a lot of, uh, uh, counseling groups that use some of the episodes as,|sd
Oh, really.|b
and, and uh, yo-, you know, that they called interaction between people and sort of to use as, uh, as a way of getting people to talk about their problems,|sd
Yeah.|b
and that sort of thing|sd
Uh, we kind of, -|%
uh, our T V viewing has, uh, slowed down a little bit since our our daughter came along,|sd
so, uh, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
that, that tends to, uh, put a cramp in your viewing, because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything, uh, it's, uh, very little T V time left.|sv
Yeah,|aa
you are too tired --|bf
Yeah.|b
Oh, it's better to spend time with your kids, I think though, than glued in front of the T V anyway.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's right.|aa
Probably more worthwhile.|sv
I just don't, I don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be, really.|sv
No,|aa
I, I can not, uh, *typo? cannot?|sd
I don't think there were, Uh, -|sv
I have not, I have not, uh, uh, there are not as many good shows that I, that I continuously like to watch as much as I used to|sd
I, uh, you know, ther-, -|%
I, uh, I used to could be able to name ten shows or so, you know, that I felt were worth my time to watch,|sd
but, uh, I uh, you know very seldom like to watch you know those,|sd
there's a couple now that I tend to want to watch.|sd
I like, uh, home improvement shows like Bob Vela's, uh, HOME AGAIN on Saturday morning,|sd
Right,|b
yeah.|b
it's, I notice it's like, it's like THIS OLD HOUSE,|sd
yeah|%
but it's, uh, it's on -|%
instead of being on pub-, P B S it's on regular T V.|sd
Oh.|b
But, it's, uh, it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house|sd
and, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
I have seen parts of that before,|sd
it is interesting.|sv
Yeah,|aa
so I like to watch that|sd
and uh, some, some things on P B S I like to watch|sd
but, uh. -|%
Do you watch sports much on T V?|qy
Yeah,|ny
if it's someb-, if it's a team or something that I am really interested in I am not one to just watch a football game just, just to be watching it|sd
or,|sd
Yeah.|b
but, uh, baseball to me is a little hard to watch on T V,|sd
Yeah.|b
It's slow.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it's so slow that you just get bored, you know,|bf
I, I will switch between something else and, and a baseball game going back and forth, you know watching it.|sd
But, I usually, -|%
if, if, if it's a football team I really like, a college team or, or pro team that I am fond of, I usually will sit and watch that.|sd
But, uh, that's the -|%
Yeah,|aa
we are like that|sd
and occasionally we will, like on, if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something,|sd
But, uh,|sv
Yeah.|b
it's pretty slow.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it's kind of like,|sv
Yeah.|b
Do you wa-, -|%
we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home, because there's just,|sd
and, -|%
Right.|aa
I think that that's what more people are doing|sv
and I think that's, you know, -|sv
as, as T V, -|%
I think the less good shows being on T V has caused a lot of people to do, to do that, uh, you know, get more movies and watch.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I know we, we have done that too in the past, uh,|sd
we do not do it quite as much now, cause our baby will not let us watch them.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, you know, we usually will, we used to rent, uh, two or three movies on a weekend and, and try to watch.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Do you have cable T V?|qy
No, uh,|nn
We do not either.|sd
we live in, -|sd
I thought we were the only ones|sd
No.|aa
No,|aa
we, uh, -|%
the, uh, development we moved into was, -|sd
they have it on one si-, like right across the street from us, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but when they built our section they did not, did not put it in|sd
and we have been there about two years now.|sd
Gosh.|ba
and they are still, still do not have it|sd
so|sd
Yeah.|b
I have contacted them about this|sd
and they say that well, it's, it's, -|sd
they look, -|%
they, every year they look at, uh, different areas and try to determine where, where, uh, the most houses will be,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and so they, uh, they look|sd
and they, when they, when we reach a certain number of people in that area they will put one in, put,|sd
Huh.|b
Yeah.|b
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
Well, we had it for awhile|sd
and it just seemed like we never watched it|sd
any we did not have the movie channels,|sd
we just had all the normal ones,|sd
Yeah.|b
and we just never watched any of them,|sd
we kept a log for a month of every time we watched it|sd
and it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour,|sd
Um. Yeah.|b
so we decided to just cancel it.|sd
It does improve the reception a little bit though,|sd
that's the only thing.|sd
Yeah.|aa
I have, I put some, put in some, uh, an antenna, a really good antenna|sd
and, uh, it's really helped, you know, ours|sd
and it's not been too bad.|sd
I have not really missed it that much,|sd
there's certain things that I have, that I want to see, you know, occasionally, like a football game, a college game or something that happens to be on cable, or some old movie,|sd
but the, uh, -|%
I, I have not been bothered by it too much.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, -|%
Well, I can not, uh, think of too much else to say. *typo cannot?|sd
Right.|b
Okay.|b
Well, it was nice talking to you.|fc
Alright,|fc
bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
Uh, we are to discuss air pollution and, uh, what we think the causes are.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I probably would, uh, target, uh,|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's probably a major one.|sv
I think, uh, individually, uh, just by the vast number of people there are, there's I think cars are also a major contributor to it.|sv
Well, vehicles|arp_nd
and, and, -|%
yes.|aa
Yeah,|b
vehicles|b^m
Right,|aa
because, uh, there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there,|sd
Huh .|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
I think they would generate probably, uh, one of them would probably generate enough for three cars.|sv
But that's not, -|%
and I think it can be resolved if, uh, if they really let go with,|sv
and muffled, talking to Just a minute, I'm on the phone|t3
and they haven't released it yet.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think there's a lot of hold back, uh, because,|sv
Yeah.|b
and, uh, it's, -|%
Well, it , -|%
You have some children.|sd
Yes|aa
I have, I have five in the kitchen at the moment.|sd
to You need to shut the door, please.|t3
Shut the door right now.|t3
We have the air conditioner running.|t3
What do you need?|t3
Hurry.|t3
I'm on the phone|t3
Yes,|t3
you may.|t3
And they keep turning the tape recorder up besides|sd
Oh, okay|bk
Do you have, do you watch children|qy
or do you, -|qrr
Um, I have three of my own|sd
and I have, uh, two that I'm tending for the summer.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so, -|%
Well, that's interesting.|ba
Um, is there anything, -|qy
They cause more noise pollution than air pollution|sd
Well, temporarily they do.|sv
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
Then we get out of that phase,|sv
Yeah.|b
But, um, I think another, -|sv
you can tell when you go around cities, you can smell specific things from, from, specific industries.|sd
Oh, yes.|sd
I remember being, -|sd
I, I grew up in New Jersey --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I can remember the smell of Newark vividly|sd
Uh-huh,|b
sure.|b
And it's the type of industry, you know, which obviously if you can smell it, it's in the air.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I know, uh, uh, in Michigan, uh, the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it,|sd
and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, um, of course, now, -|%
Well, people think you burn it, it's gone,|sv
but it's not gone.|sd
No,|aa
and when they, -|%
and you bury it|sd
and it's not gone either, because it has untold ramifications.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh,|sv
Then it just gets into the soil and into the water|sd
Yeah.|b
and they're, and they're destroying us,|sv
they,|sv
Yeah.|b
We really have to do more,|sv
So I think the cockroach will evolve, uh, sa-, safely|sv
So they say|h
I think we've got to do more with the recycling.|sv
That's, -|%
I'm, I'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening.|sd
Yes,|aa
but there's not enough.|sv
Yeah.|b
And we need expert cooperation.|sv
Well, it's a, -|%
we're getting, -|%
at least they're starting, you know.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Education of the,|sv
So at least they're moving that direction.|sv
Yeah.|b
And, uh, and we're hard to teach.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, -|%
We are hard to teach.|sv
it's going to, it's probably going to be a generation or two before,|sv
Absolutely,|aa
yeah.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
and the children are being taught in the schools more, it'll be, you know, on down the road this is going to be passed on, which is good.|sv
Absolutely,|aa
yes.|aa
Uh, of course, uh, we would like to see it accelerated because, uh, of the critical nature of it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
The, the learning of it and the, -|sv
just to, um, think that way, we have to be in that thought pattern and able to, um, motivate ourselves to, um, uh, do what is right for the atmosphere.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I think we're all contributors.|sv
I mean, every human being that lives is a contributor,|sv
Yeah.|b
so,|%
Yeah.|b
I think you're right,|aa
education is a big thing --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and as we educate them individually what they can do, people become more aware of the things in industry too that, that are causing problems|sv
and, and I think that they'll grad-, they'll work towards solving those problems more too. Um,|sv
Well, hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
You know, I mean,|sv
Just a minute and I'll turn it up.|t3
I'll turn it up in a minute, honey, when I'm done.|t3
So um, it's just, um, very critical, I think at this point to,|sv
Uh-huh|b
Yeah.|b
Well, I think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Um,|%
I, I don't know if they offer classes in, uh, the, uh, in the grade school,|sd
I think they teach it a lot in science|sd
In science,|b^m
okay.|bk
Yeah.|b
I would think that that's where it would come through.|sd
What grade level would that be?|qw
Would that be, um, perhaps,|qy
I,|sd
Well, I mean, are they starting, though, at, at, with the children that are so,|qy
their little minds are like sponges|sv
and they can really|sv
Yeah.|b
I think they are starting probably in the first grade.|sd
They're, you know, they're hearing somewhat about it.|sd
Um, I know, uh, Target has their program to make kids more aware of it|sd
and, -|%
Target stores?|br
Yeah.|aa
Oh, okay.|bk
They've got, if you go in the entrance, they've got, uh, stands usually where they have, um, little, uh, kind of a little newspaper thing --|sd
Okay.|b
and|sd
Oh, I see.|bk
Uh-huh,|b
help fight the pollution.|^2
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
So, -|%
Well, I'm sure that, uh, perhaps they're the leaders, you know,|sv
and other will, others will pick up on their example and carry it, uh, further.|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, because, uh, thoughts are, -|sv
Well, I, I know it's har-, it's a hard problem to solve because you, you know, like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more,|sd
and then there's the paper and plastic bag question.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I guess we're supposed to talk about music.|sd
Okay.|aa
And, uh, let me go ahead and push one here.|oo_co_cc
Uh, do you ha-, -|qy
are you a musician yourself?|qy
Uh, well, I sing.|na
Uh-huh.|b
I don't play an instrument.|sd
Uh-huh.|b

do you sing in, in a choir or a choral group?|qy

What kind of singing do you like to do?|qw

Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
Um, are you, uh, are, are, have you, have you been singing a long time|qy
or have you studied?|qrr
Oh, yeah.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
A long time out, all through college and everything I was in the choirs.|sd
Right.|b
And I've had some classical vocal training.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Uh-huh.|ny
Oh, great.|ba
Did, did you do that in, uh, Texas, or somewhere else?|qy
No,|nn
I was in Europe.|sd
Oh.|b
Whereabouts?|qw
In, uh, in Germany.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
Um, well, I likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs,|sd
and then I didn't sing in a choral group, um, until after I was, uh, married,|sd
and I sang in a couple of, uh, community choirs, and then um, waited for a while,|sd
and now I've, for about the last eight years I've sung in a church choir here,|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
And, um, so I, I enjoy,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, are you a soprano, alto, or, -|qy
Soprano.|sd
A soprano.|b^m
Yeah, so am I.|sd
Do you, -|qy
and, uh, what kind of music do you like to sing?|qw
Um, you were saying you had classical training.|sd
Do you have a particular composer that you like or,|qy
Oh, well,|%
as far as opera goes, I'm, I think most fond of Verdi.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I've been listening to, um, some, uh, some advertisements for MADAM BUTTERFLY,|sd
and I'm wondering if you, if you have ever done anything like that,|sd
have you ever done any, uh, if,|qy
No,|nn
no,|nn
I haven't done, uh, -|sd
I'd love to,|sd
Yes.|b
but, um, that's, uh, Puccini, I think,|sd
right?|^g
Uh-huh,|ny
yes,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
Um, MADAM BUTTERFLY was, um,|sd
it's been two or three years ago now,|sd
and then I went to see that,|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It was particularly well, -|sd
the acting was particularly nice, I thought,|sd
and, um, so,|sd
Yeah.|b
Um, you don't play, um, an instrument|sd
so,|qy
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
That, I think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does, you know, some other kind of instrument,|sv
I think piano is always good background,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
beginner. -|%
Um, I played piano all through, well, I guess from the time I was fi-, five until I graduated from college,|sd
and, uh, then I was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school,|sd
so, um, that was the instrument both of my children started on,|sd
but neither of them stayed with it|sd
Uh-huh.|b
One of them, um, turned into a violist,|sd
and the other one is, the boy is, um, guitar and, and percussion,|sd
so. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Um, but the, -|%
I, I think that the piano background is very, um, useful,|sv
and, um, I'm sure that it, for you, it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself,|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Do you have any other kind of music that you like?|qy
Um, oh, I like to listen to all different kinds of music.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I have a, -|%
I used to work with a fellow who had, um, -|sd
although this was a computer company, he had his, uh, P H D in musical, uh, I guess it was in composition, actually, from University of North Texas,|sd
and, uh, yet when I would go into his,|sd
It may be country,|sd
it might be classical,|sd
it might be rock, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- it was just, he said that, that just about what you said, that he just liked all kinds of music.|sd
Yeah|b
And that was, that was neat for, for me to hear that somebody is, -|sd
There's, you know, some of the really totally country stuff, I don't really particularly like|sd
but, -|%
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Um, do you have any plans to, uh, do anything with your music in the near future|qy
or, -|%
Well, I have, I have like, we, -|sd
I wish I could --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but I, I don't really know how to go about it without having a degree|sd
or, -|%
Yeah.|b
um|%
I know that there are, if you're interested in choral singing, -|sd
I'm not sure where,|sd
but I do know that some communities have,|sd
and,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Um, it's not r-, terribly demanding.|sv
You might have to audition,|sd
but that probably wouldn't be a problem,|sv
but, um, there usually, you know, -|sd
that they take tours and things like that -|sd
and you get to know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so --|sv
Yeah.|b
I think that's, well, that's one reason why I have enjoyed my choir so much, is that not only do we sing wonderful music,|sd
but we've gotten to know each other quite well, um, in, on a, a social level,|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think, you know,|sd
That's good.|ba
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
So, whereabouts in,|qw
Oh, I'm in Flower Mound.|sd
Flower Mound,|b^m
okay.|bk
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I'm in Plano,|sd
so, um, we're just not too far apart, actually.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's pretty close.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It was funny, um, uh,|sd
it's, you know, -|%
I talk to people all over, uh, Texas, um, and only one person outside of the coun-, uh, of the state,|sd
so I'm always asking where, where in the state, you know, the person is from if they're in Texas.|sd
Yeah.|b
Um, are, do you have a family?|qy
Um, I'm married.|na
Uh-huh.|b
I was wondering if your, if your spouse, -|qy^d

I'm sorry?|br
Uh, if you have other people in your family who are also musical.|qy^d

Yeah,|ny
I think so.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
That often is the case, um,|sv
the, you know, -|%
it's, it, sometimes it will skip.|sv
Like my husband is not musical at all,|sd
but his mother is very musical,|sd
and, um, and his children are very musical,|sd
so you never know where the talent is going to show up, I guess, sometimes.|sv
So, um, well, I'm not sure how long we've talked.|sd
I think, -|%
I haven't paid, haven't been paying attention to the, to the clock.|sd
But, uh, I'll bet we've done, we've done at least five minutes.|sd
Probably|sd
Well, I've enjoyed talking with you,|fc
Okay.|fc
and, um, maybe we'll talk again.|fc
All right,|fc
thanks.|ft
Uh-huh.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
So, Beverly, what do you think about drug testing?|qo
I think in some professions it's, uh, essential. Things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly.|sv
Yeah.|aa
We've, we got a lot of mistakes here, uh, in the Maryland, Baltimore area because of, uh, train conductors --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think we've had two terrible accidents here recently,|sd
and also on, um, just like, I bet you within five days a truck where the, uh, a dump truck, where the driver was, uh, high on marijuana, -|sd
I guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and, uh, drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the, uh, a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay --|sd
Oh, my goodness,|ba
-- and it would, -|%
that would, tied up traffic for a long time,|sd
everybody died,|sd
the fire was terrible,|sd
it was awful.|sd
So, yeah,|%
I think you're right,|sv
I, I think I, if it's, if you're in a field, -|sv
but then you know, who would test all truck drivers --|qh
They, -|%
that's, that is a problem --|sv
-- and every time before they get into a vehicle --|qh
Right,|aa
yeah --|aa
-- I think, I think, looking at athletes being drug tested -- -|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- I don't know,|h
even, I think the random drug testing, I don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs, because they're still being caught --|sd
Right.|b
-- that make sense?|qy
Yes,|ny
uh, it may make a difference for some of them --|sv
Yeah,|aa
and then, uh, I think, -|sv
Yeah.|b
I, I, I think, in the long run I think it's, it would be good.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it --|sv
Right.|b
Uh-huh --|b
-- I don't, I don't know.|h
-- however, here in Dallas --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing,|sd
and was to the point, he was on probation,|sd
he was to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract,|sd
and they wouldn't have to pay him,|sd
and the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him,|sd
but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract --|sd
Right.|b
-- and, uh, just recently he was, uh, missing from practice|sd
and whenever he missed like that, usually he had some kind of problem|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
so they were able to --|sd
Get rid of him.|^2
Right,|b
yeah.|b
B-, -|%
And so, in his case, he lost his whole career,|sd
he's been in the paper, in jail,|sd
and it's just been awful --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and talk about a terrible role model,|sd
Right,|aa
I, I think, that, that, that's a terrible thi-, you know, -|sv
it's really funny though, um,|sv
I guess, my dad was hit by a, a drunk driver who was also high --|sd
Um.|%
Oh, my goodness.|ba
-- and, um, though he's alive today and everything worked out fine, it, it, it happened about two blocks from the high school|sd
and a friend came and got me,|sd
and I was there,|sd
and I could smell the dope,|sd
and I could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and nothing ever happened,|sd
and from --|sd
Oh, that's terrible.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
but I really, uh, -|%
I'm so anti drunk driving,|sd
and, and drugs have, uh, long lasting effects --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I guess when I younger I was, um, probably a little more liberal on the subject.|sd
I think most of us are.|sv
Yeah,|aa
but as I've, as soon as that happened, -|sd
I guess when I was eighteen years old, if you'd have asked me, I'd have thought it was fine --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed.|sd
Yes,|aa
if you know someone, -|sv
for example we have, uh, some friends whose son was driving home from work, was hit head on by a drunk driver -- -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- the drunk and his wife in the car were killed,|sd
and, uh, Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school --|sd
Right.|b
-- he went through surgery after surgery --|sd
Um. Traction and all that terrible stuff.|sd
-- and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again.|sd
And he, -|%
as far as his ath-, athletics, he's lost all of that.|sd
Right.|b
He, uh, has been tutored,|sd
and he'll catch up in school and everything,|sd
but, he's still not back where he was.|sd
Right,|b
yeah,|b
I don't think somebody, -|sv
He may never have all those motor skills back.|sd
Yeah,|b
you don't, you don't, you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life.|sv
No.|aa
I can't even say, you know, I wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life.|sd
You don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life.|sv
Another thing that we saw here recently. One of, some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a, a train track ran through --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train.|sd
Well, he, the train missed him,|sd
but, uh, a big mirror type thing sticking out, like a metal thing sticking out, hit him in the head --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- he was in a coma for --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
he's out of the coma now,|sd
and eventually they think he will come back,|sd
but you don't know that,|sd
and -- -|%
Right.|b
-- but he's lost, -|sd
he was an outstanding football player,|sd
So, what kind of a house do you live in?|qw
I'm in a, uh, in a ranch.|sd
A, uh, -|%
it was about, uh, sixteen hundred square feet when I bought it,|sd
and, uh, it's about two thousand square feet now,|sd
but it's one of those typical, uh, ranches that you find around here.|sd
Oh, it's, uh, built in the, probably built in the late fifties|sd
so it's not, um, what you would find, uh, where you live.|sd
But, uh, for the older, uh, ranch homes it's pretty typical I guess.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, our home is, uh, probably, for our area it's probably one of the lower income homes out here.|sd
Uh, most of the, the homes that they're building, -|sd
well, I shouldn't say all of them,|h
but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars.|sd
Really?|bh
Oh yeah,|ny
there's, -|%
How many square feet do you have?|qw
We have got about, uh, twenty, I'd say about twenty-four hundred.|sd
Four bedrooms?|qy
Uh, we've got five bedrooms,|sd
Five bedrooms.|b^m
Uh-huh.|b
A, a bedroom for my mother,|sd
and, uh, -|%
I made a, I made a fourth bedroom out of, uh, a made a fourth bedroom out of one of our, out of our living room and then added a, uh, what we call a sunroom --|sd
Oh.|b
when, when we added four hundred square feet to our house -- -|sd
Oh, that's great.|ba
-- so that, -|%
Well, this, this house is very comfortable.|sd
We've got two living areas|sd
and that, that's the thing I probably like the most about it.|sd
How many stories?|qw
Just one?|qy
It's just one story.|sd
Yeah.|ny
It's a Fox and Jacobs home.|sd
How are they built?|qw
Um, we've been real happy with it.|sd
Yeah.|b
I've heard that,|sd
I've heard the construction is pretty good on Fox and Jacobs.|sd
Of course, I'm not a carpenter or anything like that.|h
They could probably come in and say, gee, this is not straight|sd
and this is under something|^q
but, -|%
But I mean it doesn't give you trouble?|qy^d
No.|nn
Uh-huh.|b
No,|nn
we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all.|sd
No cracked slab or anything like that?|qy^d
No.|nn
All right.|bk
We've been real lucky.|sd
So, -|%
And is it, um, a natural gas and, -|sd
Yeah.|b
You know what I miss though?|qh
Basements.|sd
Oh, yeah.|ba
I sur-, I sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas.|sd
Yeah,|b
I, I've heard a lot of people say that.|sd
That's for sure.|ba
Uh, we have an attic that we've just put, you know, plywood ove-, over the beams and things up in the attic|sd
and so that,|sd
So you, -|%
but certainly not, -|sd
Can you stand up in it?|qy
Uh, in parts.|na
I mean you couldn't, you really couldn't use it for a room.|sd
So you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here.|qy^d
Yes.|ny
Th-, -|%
ours is pitched so shallow that you, uh, don't get much room in the attic.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
we, uh, we've got, you know, -|sd
I'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there.|sd
So, five bedrooms and two living, two family t-, -|bf
Two living areas.|b^m
We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then we have a, the, uh, family room, kitchen, and playroom --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
In fact, I really enjoy the playroom that,|sd
y-, you would think that would not be a real bonus, you know, to a house,|sd
but of all the rooms in the house I'd say that was, that was the one that's been really nice to have|sd
Isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time.|qh
I think that's true.|aa
You c-, -|%
Yeah.|b
Probably our family room is the, the biggest. Uh,|sd
Right.|b
Some people, I mean, -|%
families seem to migrate towards one, one room and carry on most of their activities there,|sv
and, uh, uh, some rooms, we have one room that we never use.|sd
Yeah.|b
I mean might as well not even heat and cool it.|sd
Yeah.|b
Strange.|sv
Well, that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it is nice to have it because there's, uh, with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come --|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So -|%
So you've been fairly happy with it.|bf
How long have you been in it?|qw
Seventeen years.|sd
Wow.|ba
Boy, it doesn't seem that long|sd
but it is because we, uh, came to this area about the same time|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We've been fifteen, fifteen years in the, in the house that we're living in.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
And we, the, the principal feature I like about ours is that it's pier and beam.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
Yours is a slab I assume.|qy^d
Yes,|ny
it is.|sd
Yeah,|b
ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that I could not have done if it was slab.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that, by myself and saved a lot of money that I couldn't have done if the house was on a slab.|sd
Well, that's interesting.|ba
But that's because it's so old.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's thirty-five, thirty-six years old when they used to build like that,|sd
and, uh, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Well, my husband wouldn't do that anyway.|sd
That's his, that's his, -|%
I know,|aa
he's not a handy,|sd
right?|^g
worst thing in life is to have to repair something.|sd
I, on the other hand, se-,|sd
So, -|%
and, uh, I've gotten good at it which in a, in a way is bad because then you, uh, you start to take pleasure in it|sd
Well, uh, that's great.|ba
We just kind of save everything for when Al , uh, for, for when his Dad comes to visit|sd
and then he does all the repairing, you know,|sd
he does -|sd
Right.|b
My Dad is actually, uh, -|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
where does she live?|qw
Uh, on Rutherford.|sd
Rutherford.|b^m
I don't know that.|sd
It's, uh, corner of New York --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's, oh, oh, south and, okay, -|bk
yeah,|b
I know where you, I know the area.|sd
Uh.|%
Right,|b
that's kind of on the other side of town,|sd
so --|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
Oh, they're, they're little ones|sd
Oh, well, I've got one in college|sd
Oh.|b
By now.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Let's see, we're on government,|sd
Right.|aa
Whether it is possible to have an honest government. I'm beginning to think it's not.|sd
What about you?|qo
I, I don't think under the way the system is right now, it is.|sv
I don't either.|aa
I, I think, -|sv
uh, even if people have good intentions, I think uh, power corrupts or something to a certain extent, you know.|sv
The ultimate power, ultimately re-, corrupts.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it seems like, uh, maybe more of them come in with good intentions,|sv
but it's just so enticing,|sv
and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available, because they're in on the know , you know -|sv
I don't know if,|sd
Oh.|b
I just, I just don't, uh, -|sd
Right.|aa
I mean, you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions,|sv
you know what I mean?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Right.|aa
Little bitty, little bitty positions in your own home town, and they'll cheat somehow or, you know, bend the rules, use their power.|sv
So maybe it's just man's nature|sv
We had, uh, here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major, uh, corruption on, on our county commissioners --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and there were several counties, uh, including the one I was in, that lost every one of their county commissioners|sd
and,|sd
Oh, my word.|ba
Oh, wow.|ba
What were they doing taking some, -|qw
Oh, they were taking kickbacks.|sd
Oh, no|ba
Yeah|b
Oh, gosh.|ba
Just a little here, a little there.|sd
Yeah,|b
right|b
Major amount here, a major amount there.|sd
Right|b
Oh.|%
But I think there was something like, you know, thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail.|sd
Um. We haven't had that big a scandal in Arlington,|sd
but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records.|sd
In other words, they'd go out and have a big, lavish dinner and then put somebody's name down that they supposedly had entertained,|sd
but that person wasn't even anywhere near there, you know.|sd
Some of them weren't even in the same city.|sd
One of them had, had cancer and died|sd
and I mean, that was our biggest scandal for the last few years, I think.|sd
Uh, that's, that's small scale.|sv
I don't know, you know,|h
I really don't know what could be done. Uh,|sd
I don't, I don't either. Uh, to make it totally honest.|sd
Uh, I think there's, there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner, uh.|sv
However, the things that have gone, gone on in the last couple of years, we can't afford too many of those, you know, the --|sv
That's right.|aa
We could almost not afford such terrible corruption.|sv
The cover-ups and, -|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
I think that, uh, Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing,|sv
and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that,|sv
but, uh, -|%
I, uh, I don't know.|h
I just, uh, I'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests.|sd
Right.|b
I think that's what upsets me worse than, that they're getting a little, you know, uh, on the side --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
That's right,|aa
but they stay there, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right,|aa
and this would be for the best for the nation overall.|sv
You're right,|aa
it's just a, -|%
I don't know.|h
I guess that's where they stay in, uh, in, -|sv
they try to stay in office.|sv
But they always please the money people too.|sv
They need money so much, because they're constantly having to run,|sv
run, -|^2
And, -|%
Maybe|arp_nd
and then you think, well, if it was longer terms --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That's true.|aa
Boy, it is a big problem,|sv
but I think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now,|sv
don't you?|^g
I don't think that they, anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government.|sv
I know.|aa
It's really terrible.|sv
I mean, there was a time, I mean where, I remember when I was real young, I just loved Harry Truman.|sd
I thought he was great|sd
Oh, you know, I had, -|%
some of them seemed like kind of, uh, heroic people.|sd
Well I wonder if they really were,|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Jerry, the topic was favorite T V shows, and what kind are you interested in, and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well, okay, uh,|bk
most of, most of the, uh, commercial television these days, I'm just a little bit sick of.|sd
Uh, in fact, I don't watch hardly any, uh, television at all with, uh, my other activities.|sd
Uh, between my family and my church et cetera, et cetera, well --|sd
Right.|b
Now I do watch the Discover channel and some on channel thirteen|sd
but, uh, aside from --|sd
Oh, do you,|bh
yeah.|b
Oh, I'm sort of a, well, -|sd
I'm different from that.|sd
I'm sort of a, a movie buff.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I go to a couple of mov-, movies a week, sometimes,|sd
but honestly I'm, I'm self-employed,|sd
and a lot of times I will, uh, go out and take a lunch hour, go to lunch from like twelve to two, go to a movie and just come back to my office.|sd
I don't blame you.|ba
But, uh, I do it, -|sd
it's like entertainment,|sd
and I'm pretty much of a, a junk movie watcher by myself.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
If I take my wife, then we see something a little nicer, you know.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
But, uh, -|%
and my kids are all sort of movie watchers.|sd
You know, we, we've always been to a lot of, we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life.|sd
So, but I would just as soon, uh, be doing something else,|sd
it's just that my kids are gone now,|sd
and, and my wife's a school teacher|sd
and sometimes, and she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock.|sd
So, you know, I'll come in like five thirty or six,|sd
and I'll turn on the tube --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and sometimes I set there all evening.|sd
Yeah|b
I, well, it, -|%
sometimes if, if it's real good, -|sd
like there's more, there's been more than one evening that I've, uh, caught, uh, every animal show that evening on, uh, on the Discover channel.|sd
You bet,|ba
you bet.|ba
And, uh, because they're, uh, they're, they're, you know, they're documentaries and they're. -|sd
Well, that's an interesting channel.|sv
Oh, you bet,|aa
in fact I'm glad that it's part of our, uh, basic cable package.|sd
That's great.|ba
But, uh, -|%
You know, I've, I've just never spent any time watching it|sd
and, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but I, -|%
Oh, oh, me too.|sd
Hello|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Watch my Dallas Cowboys.|sd
I watched them to halftime before I left|sd

Well, they, they, who-, --|sd
-- and started dri-, driving.|sd
They sure did.|aa
They just did an excellent job.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
and they're in the playoffs,|sd
and I'm not sure that the Eagles are not.|sd
Yeah,|b
the Eagles -- -|b^m
I did.|sd
-- yeah|b
luck into it now, I think. -|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
Cowboys, they earned it on their own merit.|sv
Well. -|%
Did you know, everybody, or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson,|sd
but, uh, he's, uh, he's brought the pokes, uh, from a, a one and something team to, uh, playoffs, in what, three years now.|sd
You bet,|aa
as much as everyone, you know, used the word, love Tom Landry, I'm glad that Jimmy Johnson's there.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
well, it's, uh, you know, it was the time for the passing of the guard, I mean.|sv
It was.|aa
And I think Tom knew it.|sv
I think so too.|aa
So, uh, -|%
He wanted to go out a winner though.|sv
I think he would have stayed there four or five more years until he could have gone out -|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true,|aa
and I wouldn't, I wouldn't have blamed him one bit --|sd
Oh, no,|aa
it's, you know --|sv
-- yeah,|b
but, see, nobody remembers him as a loser --|sv
I know.|aa
Oh, yeah.|ba
Yeah,|aa
he's a, he's a winner in anyone's book --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- and I hope he's a winner in his own book, you know because --|sd
Oh, he is,|sv
he is --|sv
-- because he has to like himself --|sv
You bet.|aa
Little things that disturb me, -|sd
and I know he's being a little hardnosed about it|sd
but, uh, you know, this ring of honor thing, you know, he needs to be there --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
He deserves it,|sv
and he was the Dallas Cowboys,|sv
and --|sd
Yes.|b
So. I hope he makes up his mind to do it, because --|sd
Oh, he will.|sv
Right.|aa
Well, nobody's going to forget Tom Landry.|sv
No,|aa
no,|aa
no.|aa
Shoot, come now|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Absolutely not|aa
That's true,|aa

I mean, I'd not a -- -|%
let's put it that way.|h
-- you betcha.|aa
I'm not a native Texan by birth|sd
but, uh, I guess if I, uh, length of, length of time I'm in the state now, is what, after you're here twenty years you're considered native.|sd
You bet.|aa
I've been here since seventy-four,|sd
and I feel like a native.|sd
Well, let's see,|^h
I came down March of sixty-nine, went to work for T and I.|sd
Oh, did you.|bh
Yeah.|ny
Yeah.|b
So, uh, I haven't looked back yet either,|sd
so -|%
We came, we came down from New York state in seventy-four, and uh, never had any regrets at all.|sd
Right.|aa
Especially looking at some of the weather New York state has had --|sv
You bet.|aa
It's been.|sd
-- and then look at the weather we have down here.|ad
Huh|%
It's a great place to raise our kids,|sd

are you?|qy
No,|nn
not at all.|sd
No,|aa
me neither.|sd
I'm enjoying the chat. Uh.|sd
Well, I enjoy my T V programs.|sd
I like those,|sd
I like those detective programs.|sd
I like everything.|sd
I can watch Bill Cosby because I think he has a great show.|sd
Well. -|%
Do you have, uh, some strong feelings one way or the other about, about the care of the elderly?|qy
Well, yes,|ny
I do.|sd
Uh, this is a, a question that hit pretty close to home.|sd
I had to go through this with my dad about four years ago.|sd
He was, his health was failing --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, he was adamant about two things.|sd
One was that I take care of my mother,|sd
and two, that he not be put into a home.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we talked, uh, about some length,|sd
and I respected his wishes.|sd
He, uh, stayed at home as long as he could,|sd
and then, uh, he died in a hospital.|sd
But, um, I think that, my position wa-, is that, uh, you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care of the, of the, uh, of their clients --|sd
Yes.|b
-- and, um, because I've heard about the many abuses, and because he had heard of so many abuses, he just didn't want that.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
How about you?|qo
Well, my graduate work is in speech pathology,|sd
and, uh, so, so, uh, I've thought about this more than once, uh, you know, dealing with -|sd
uh, you know, I'm concerned, we're going to have a geriatric, uh, population, in in twenty years it's going to be, you know, phenomenal.|sd
Yeah,|b
almost thirty, all over thirty percent, isn't it.|qy
Yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
Uh, and, um, but I have been amazed|sd
and, and in talking with, uh, some of my fellow students, it looks as though, um, nursing homes are not going to be the only option any more|sd
and, uh, in twenty years. Uh, where a lot of students are hoping, uh, to work as an in the home type, uh, uh, approach, where, where the, uh, where there's, you know, the speech therapist, or whether it's a nursing specialist or someone plans to, uh, work out of a family's home and take the responsibility away from the family but yet allow the, the loved one to stay, you know, at home --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, it's, it's difficult for many families, especially in the case of, uh, of Alzheimer's and, and, uh, some of the more degenerative diseases to, uh, say, uh, uh, leave them, to have them at home, because then the family becomes completely, uh -- -|sd
They're captive.|sv
-- exactly.|aa
Yeah,|b
and, and did, did you experience that with your, with your father or not?|qy
Uh, we had a, at one stage we had care somewhat like, like what you're talking about.|sd
We had the Visiting Nurses program --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they sent somebody in,|sd
and it, it was a, a nominal charge that this, uh, it started out that the lady would come in I think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day.|sd
Yeah.|b
They would try to get him to exercise.|sd
They would try to, uh, you know, -|sd
they would check him over to, to, you know, the basic checks.|sd
Try to get him to talk and be motivated --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, that's what we went through.|sd
Uh, up to a point things seemed to be working,|sd
and then, uh, I think, he, he became discouraged --|sd
Right.|b
-- and they did not know how to take care of that,|sd
and then, um, at that point I think it's mostly a psychological problem.|sv
Oh.|b
And, uh, but, yes,|aa
I agree there's a lot of options.|sd
There could be a lot of options.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think it's time that, uh, we decide to do something about it.|sv
Yeah.|b
Um.|%
Definitely.|aa
You know, one of the other subjects on the switchboard, and this is one that I've been thinking applies here, uh, where, where, uh, young, young kids, uh, graduating from high school, whether they should do a community service type work.|sd
This would be an excellent example of some where, uh, some place where, um, the community could be more involved, you know, more than just leaving it only to professionals.|sv
There is a lot the community, the community can do to, uh, enhance the, or, or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home.|sv
I suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need.|sd
Possibly before.|sv
I don't know now.|sd
Yeah,|b
the church or synagogue, whatever --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but in today's large metropolitan areas, or even in most, even, even the rural areas now, people are not quite as close as they once were.|sv
Huh-uh.|aa
Uh, the mobility factor, the factor that, uh, oh, we're living longer and people are less trusting, all these things tend to destroy this type of system.|sv
But I agree with you,|sd
there might be some possibilities there.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do.|sv
I agree.|aa
That's a, that's a good point.|sv
I think they would have to have some training.|sv
All righty.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Uh, I guess our topic today is air pollution.|sd
And we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution, as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us.|sd
Right.|aa
Um, does your work entitle, uh, anything of environmental along these lines?|qy
Me, I'm in the legal department|sd
and, um, we do have, uh, a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I don't know too much about the air pollution thing.|sd
I do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that T I has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground, you know, we're coming up with a, uh, a new solution.|sd
We have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump|sd
and we just transport to these places.|sd
But after awhile it always seems that the, um, oh, the site starts to leak|sd
and then you have to clean it up and such.|sd
But the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman,|sd
and we're going have that, you know, incineration place up there and,|sd
Right.|b
And supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what I've heard, that everything would be in, in, you know, a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up.|sd
And that we won't be polluting the air.|sd
I'm sure we have to have, uh, permits, you know, for that place. And that there's, you know, limits as to what we can, uh, let, you know, go into the air.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's, uh, hav-, uh, uh, well, -|%
I work in , I work in environmentals, uh, projects right now.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
And so the Sherman deal is, um, uh, lost a lot of hair over that project.|sd
Oh|b
Uh, what we run into, um, is we have the Texas Air Control Board, T A C B, that send out, uh, jurisdictions under which we have to, uh, uh, reply to.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real clear, so we have our manager of environmental, who assist the T A C B, which is located in Austin, in writing|sd
and, hey,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
look what we've done here at T I.|ad
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, we are presently, uh, in receipt of a site permit, which will allow us to, um, uh, -|sd
this is our side a-,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's in,|sd
Okay.|b
and so, w-, w-, you know, what we do to make contributions so that, basically, we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems, uh, that, uh, scrub out the, N O X and, uh, V O C's and, and ammonia compounds, uh, like all the acids, to a certain level.|sd
We,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts.|sd
And so what we go through is, uh, if you see it smoking there's a problem.|sd
And having worked with some of the legal folks very closely, uh, it becomes a real issue, especially, when it's smoking|sd
and you have to get it fixed el pronto.|sd
Um.|%
As you know, they, they're allowed to come on site, the federaldes, anytime they want, drive through, and see, and inspect.|sd
Um.|%
So it's a full time, uh, everybody has their home phone number type of job. Um,|sd
Now is that place built|qy
or you're still on the makings of it?|qrr
The Sherman facility, we are still in the, closer too, but still have a little bit of, um, finalization to do. -|sd
Right.|%
It's been pitched to the Sherman City Council with, um,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We had open forum|sd
and, and, uh, uh, Tom Jones, our environmental, corporate environmental guys handle the project.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, its real, uh, going real well.|sd
I think it's matter, just a matter of fund,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it's, uh, it's something else.|sd
Yeah.|%
they're, they're, they're in the same issue.|sd
We were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there.|sd
Uh, because the, the system is setup where it won't have any emissions.|sd
You're correct.|sd
It will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was,|sd
Right.|b
But it won't have can any, uh, any bad stuff.|sd
So, uh, I think T I, we spend, of all the major semiconductor firms, we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost, foremost, uh, uh, first thing we always look at.|sd
And we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the system of any other firm I know of.|sd
We eat and sleep the stuff, everything we do over here.|sd
and, uh, it's an interesting job.|sd
But um, -|%
Well, I know from some of the sites that we've had, uh, quite a list of cites that have gone bad|sd
and you have to clean up.|sd
And, you know the law now is the super fund|sd
and anybody who's contributed toxic waste, no matter if you were somebody that eventually, you know, uh, damaged the ground or not.|sd
Uh, everybody has to contribute|sd
and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've gotten, uh, gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and, you know, mega bucks to, uh, you know take everything out and redo it and, you know, fill in some other area|sd
and, um, certainly, it would to have a better solution, like the Sherman facility than, um, just letting it go in the ground.|sd
Because eventually, you know, it, it seems that no matter what they do, if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined, uh, dump area.|sd
It still only in time starts to leak out.|sd
Possibly.|aap_am
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
There, there was one site that they cleaned up|sd
and then the new place leaked again. .|sd
Yeah.|aa
I'm familiar with that one.|sd
We have, we have stuff that's very interesting, uh,|sd
we have hoods,|sd
we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where, um, they have, um, that we sample --|sd
Uh-huh.|sd
-- and it may have over, uh, a certain emission levels,|sd
this is on the solid side ,|sd
and so we take it|sd
and, uh, we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid.|sd
And we mix it with concrete --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um.|%
It was totally legal.|sd
But the cost of doing this is astronomical,|sd
Um,|%
And so we were, uh, very, very, uh, cognizance of, and aware of all these types of, uh, expenditures because it could get very expensive.|sd
But I think we, uh, you know, we do all kinds of things to make the, the world a better place to live, you know,|sd
I think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that.|sd
I really would.|sd
Um, I've enjoyed speaking with you,|sd
Yeah.|b
This has been an interesting topic.|sv
Uh, I was one of the, -|sd
I was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the corporate, or in the north building|sd
Oh, you were?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Oh, okay.|bk
So, uh, I hope you like your office.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yes.|aa
Yes.|aa
It's a heck of a lot different.|sd
And we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk.|sd
We were about the only,|sd
Yeah.|b
People used to come and laugh and go, gee, I hadn't seen one of those ten, fifteen years.|sd
Yeah.|b
Glad to see y'all taken care of.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Well, the, uh, I think what changed everything and, uh, is, uh, y'all were, y'all were the only ones that make any money for TI, here in the last ten years,|sv
We,|sd
Nobody thought of us as a profit center before.|sv
Exactly.|aa
And that's, um, when, when you start, when you start paying your way, uh, you know, Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys.|sv
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
I was just, -|%
Not just overhead.|sv
Exactly.|aa
I've enjoyed speaking with you.|fc
You too.|fc
See you later.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
make sure it's nice and brown on both sides|ad
and then you take it out of the fat|ad
and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it|ad
Uh-huh.|b
And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan|ad
and you kind of clean it out|ad
and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil.|ad
Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there.|ad
And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.|ad
Stir it real, real well.|ad
Uh-huh.|b
Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.|ad
And you let it come to a boil again|ad
and then you let it simmer|ad
and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.|ad
Oh.|b
And that's going to, it's going to be really good|sv
That's very spicy, too.|bf
Yeah,|b
it's, -|%
I mean these bell peppers and curry.|bf
Right,|aa
and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.|sd
Oh, that sounds really good.|sv
Yeah.|b
Huh.|b
I guess it was, -|sd
is this dinner time for you?|qy
Uh, well it will be in a little while,|na
I'm trying to get it, get it ready early.|sd
All done in advance,|bf
yeah.|b
That's um, I, uh, I'm, I'm not that great a cook|sd
but I was single until I was thirty|sd
so I did cook a little, you know.|sd
Oh.|b
Uh, and I cook a little bit now.|sd
What I like to do mostly is stir fries|sd
and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight|sd
and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables.|sd
What kind of wok do you have,|qw
is it, is it a real Chinese wok.|qy
It's, it's called a stir fry pan|sd
and it, and it fits right on your, uh, st-, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric|sd
so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I see.|b
And, um, normally what happ-, what we do is, um, just, you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular oi-, vegetable oil.|sd
But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things.|sd
And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and, um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, uh, beforehand.|sd
That gives, uh, uh, uh, spicier flavor|sd
and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth,|sd
Yeah.|b
and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I've used, -|%
you turn them over.|sd
A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu,|sd
we don't put in meat,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but, uh, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things,|sd
so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.|sd
Yeah.|b
But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh, carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.|sd
Oh that's,|sv
It's, it's a pretty big -|sd
and we put that over rice.|sd
I just don't like squash.|sd
Oh, you don't|bf
I never did.|sd
My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash|sd
and she'd have squash and corn bread|sd
Oh.|b
And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I'd just be, -|sd
Yeah,|b
see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up.|sd
My, my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up.|sd
I'm, I'm from Pittsburgh|sd
and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Red meat and a potato.|sd
Oh, that sounds good.|ba
We, we were from North Carolina|sd
and we had a garden|sd
and my mother would, would, uh, grow the squash|sd
and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of, -|sd
Oh, she had all of those types of vegetables.|bf
Right.|aa
See, never, no vegetables in my family. -|sd
Wow.|ba
Yeah,|b
it was really funny.|sd
You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens|sd
Well that was a real farm.|bf
You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?|qy
No,|nn
but I, I've, I've heard stories uh,|sd
I've heard stories.|sd
And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.|sd
Uh.|b
And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub|sd
and finally it dies down,|sd
you get just a little patter|sd
and then it, -|sd
Oh, this is ter-, -|sv
you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner.|ad
Getting ready to eat chicken too.|sd
That's right,|aa
you should be careful|ad
That's pretty funny.|sv
But my dad used to tell stories, you know, about the way they eat chickens|sd
but I never, we never, we lived in the suburbs,|sd
we, we bought everything in a grocery store.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
There was no, -|sd
but it was funny, you know, -|sd
it so, -|%
but when we got married, you know, a lot more vegetables, a lot more, you know, a lot of changes.|sd
Well that's good.|ba
A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.|sv
I think so too,|aa
Yeah.|b
but we just went shopping|sd
and we came back with, uh, with, uh, sweets, you know, chocolate covered peanuts|sd
and --|sd
Ugh.|ba
We didn't bring all the healthy food back too.|sd
Yeah,|b
I'm trying to learn how to cook, um, deserts without, without all of the sweets, you know, maybe use honey or something.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
well that's, that's supposed to be, um, the trend of the future,|sd
Yeah.|b
I, uh, recently was over a friends house that's Indian|sd
and, uh, she had brought Indian sweets into the office|sd
and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots.|sd
Ugh.|ba
Yeah,|aa
that was a sweet|sd
and I was like ugh.|sd
This is a sweet.|^q
Oh it is, it's a candy,|^q
I'm like ugh, you know,|sd
Indian candy is not very good.|^q
Uh, right.|aa
But everything was, and everything, -|sd
you didn't notice it at first,|sd
but everything was sort of hot.|sd
Everything had a little bit of curry in it.|sd
The spice,|bf
yeah.|b
It was funny, even the sweets did.|sd
Wow.|ba
When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it|sd
but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it.|sd
You know, it had that, that after taste that, very, it was a very Indian flavor.|sd
Yeah.|b
Good,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
they didn't have, -|sd
I didn't like her desserts very well,|sd
they were very, yogurt and carrots and pin-, pistachios, pistachio nuts and yogurt.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it wasn't very good.|sd
Well I might have liked some of that|sd
I, I like hot stuff,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I really do.|sd
Yeah,|b
well have we done our ten minutes.|sd
Oh is it ten minutes.|qy
Something like that,|na
I think we're, -|sd
I don't know,|h
do we get a signal.|qy
No,|nn
nor-, normally they just come in|sd
and they say you've overextended your, your conversation.|sd
Oh, well this is my first one.|sd
Oh, okay|bk
well that's, -|%
you'll see it will normally, it will come on|sd
and it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen minutes to compl-, fifteen seconds to complete it.|sd
Oh wow.|ba
But, uh, I've been cut off twice.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So I just thought, -|sd
in fact I'm just also, -|sd
I'm hearing a siren outside I think my, my neighbors car must have got bumped, you know,|sd
he has one of those alarms on his car,|sd
Goodness.|ba
one of the, the neighbor has an alarm on a car|sd
and it's going off.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.|sd
Well, okay.|bk
Okay,|b
hey thanks so much.|ft
Yeah,|fc
thank you,|ft
it was nice talking with you.|fc
Uh-huh,|fc
and you said this was your fi-, -|bf
well you'll, you'll get a couple more probably.|sv
Yeah.|b
I, uh, I called yesterday, I, or Friday,|sd
maybe I talked to somebody that, uh, I got them on, uh, during the day.|sd
It was a housewife|sd
and she was home with two kids.|sd
Ugh.|b
And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background, you know, that they wanted something|sd
and they were arguing back and forth|sd
and she just kept talking the whole time,|sd
it was pretty funny.|sd
Yeah,|b
kind of hard that way.|bf
Okay.|b
Okay.|b
Hey thanks a lot,|ft
I'll talk to you later.|fc
All right,|fc
thank you,|ft
bye-bye.|fc
Bye.|fc
So, uh, what do you think?|qo
I think we're overtaxed to the hilt.|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I mean, we're, we're taxed on taxes|sd
and, um, uh, most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who don't have it that is.|sd
I mean we don't have one yet,|sd
but eventually they may try to push it through.|sd
Oh really.|b
So they have n-, -|bf
I didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas.|sd
No, no state income tax.|sd
Oh, that's great, because they don't have it in Florida.|sd
In New York they have it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, you know, like I say, I'm in New York|sd
and we have a state tax as well.|sd
So that just cuts even more.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits.|sv
Right,|aa
I, I think that I, -|sv
I mean, I wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't, they don't go to any place.|sd
You know, y-, you don't see it going to any place where it belongs.|sv
Right.|b
Yeah.|aa
but given that it, that it's not spent properly, I think it's a major problem.|sv
Well we're really overburdened from federal, state and local,|sv
Uh-huh|b
Well that's certainly true.|sv
Well what is it they were just talking about, um, sort of middle income, you know, how, how, middle income people, -|sd
what winds up happening is, for instance having kids, you know, they wind up having kids as a deduction|sv
and after, but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think tha-, -|%
so they want to, you know try an-, I think they're trying,|sv
I think tha-, I think that most of the politicians understand this.|sv
They just don't, they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing.|sv
Well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well.|sv
Right.|b
And, uh, I think the only way that can be changed for us to get a, a better tax revenue that's fairness and all, is for us to limit their terms.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And by doing so, they're not obligated to anybody.|sv
I agree,|aa
I agree.|aa
And, uh, I don't know how we're going to do that right away though,|sd
but, what, what in general though that taxes are doing to us is, it's just taking, uh, a bite out of our savings.|sv
Right,|aa
exactly,|aa
and then, and then, uh, I'm, I'm just not sure if I see, you know, if I see it going, like I say to the right places.|sd
I mean, it'd be, it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older.|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, but I'm not convinced, that's, a-, tha-, that Social Security is doing as well as it should and, you know, and, and, and, uh, and, and that, you know, those people who need it for welfare and so forth, who really need it for welfare, not the eighty-five to ninety percent of them who don't need it. But I mean the real people who really need it, you know, should be getting it|sd
but instead I think it's going to the wrong places.|sv
And I believe the Social Security tax is a great scheme.|sv
You think so?|qy
Yeah,|ny
it's, uh, you know, -|%
right now, they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit.|sv
I know|aa
and that scares the hell out of me.|sd
Yeah,|b
tha-, that's illegal, see.|sd
If, uh, most company, uh, C E O -s were to do that within their private company, they'd be in jail.|sv
Yeah|b
So how are we letting them get away with it.|qh
Yeah,|b
I don't, I don't,|sd
Right.|b
it'd be nice if we sort of, as one, band together|sv
and, and, uh, and, an performed a citizens arrest, I guess.|sv
Yeah.|b
To see if we could sort of clean them up|sd
and you know, but I don't know if we can do that or not.|sd
A lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I agree,|aa
I agree.|aa
But, um, yeah,|%
like, like you said, I wonder, you know, if, if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process|sd
and I wonder if it'll ever be a change process.|sd
Yeah.|b
I sort of, I sort of get discouraged when I think about all the things that I think are wrong|sd
You know, all those things that really could be changed that aren't, you know, that, that aren't.|sd
And tax is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list.|sv
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
So, I don't kno-, -|h
I, I, I have no idea what to do about it.|sd
Well there's no quick solution, or no sure fire easy answer.|sv
It's just going to take, uh, uh, really, uh, uh, uh, a combination effort, I think, of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer,|sv
Yeah.|b
See, we, we're, we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place.|sd
Right.|aa
We don't, -|aa
I mean, the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another.|sd
Right|aa
and they are controlled, or pretty much do what they want to do.|sv
Right,|aa
I've never quite understood that. I've never, uh, you know, even though, um, I, I've never been, uh, sort of politically minded,|sd
but it's never been clear to me as to sort of, um, you know, how Congressmen an, can, can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency doe-, doesn't back them up on anything, you know.|sd
And often times that will happen.|sv
Well they feel invu-, invulnerable to, uh, any wrath|sv
or,|sv
Right|b
Right.|b
And generally it does work out that way.|sv
They do forget, it's true, coul-, because everybody, -|sv
think of what happens is whenever the politici-, whenever th-, the one who made that supposed mistake turns around -|sd
and, uh, his, his or her opponent can say well look, they did this.|sd
And they can turn around and say well my opponent did this.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So it becomes, uh, a general battle of the w-, sort of the election of the lesser of two evils, I think,|sv
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
I don't know,|h
I just, uh, I'm unhappy with it|sd
but. -|%
And well, I'm, I'm sort of semifortunate right now,|sd
I'm a graduate student,|sd
so I don't make that much,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and what I make isn't taxed very highly because I'm still in school.|sd
Well when you get out into the real world then you'll know.|sv
But it's, my, my, my wife has a real job|sd
and, you know, when I get her job, um, you know, we, we look at her paycheck, I'm just floored when I see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep.|sd
Yeah.|b
Especially around bonus time.|sd
Bonus time,|b^m
you have a bonus?|qy
Bonus,|b^m
she, -|%
no,|nn
my, my wife does.|sd
Oh.|b
My wi-, -|%
I don-, -|%
no|nn
graduate students don't get bonuses.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure.|sd
So you're taxed on the bonuses too,|qy^d
right.|^g
My, my wife is taxed on her bonus as well,|sd
and that's a, that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean her bonus isn't that much,|sd
but they tax it as, -|sd
I, I guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So she gets destroyed on her bonus check.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, she works with in, in, in sales.|sd
So a good portion of her, you know, her salary is, is quarterly bonuses.|sd
Uh, sales is lucrative|sv
but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job.|sv
Yes,|aa
well, yeah,|aa
she's not entirely sales, so it isn't, it isn't as lucrative as one would hope,|sd
but, it, it keeps us supported temporarily,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, I don't know,|h
I d-, I guess, I guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it, and hope that it gets better|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, I have, I guess about said what a-, all I can think of to say.|sd
Same here,|aa
tough topic|sv
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
it's re-, a rather touchy topic at that,|sv
but -|%
I beli-, -|%
I, I, I do agree with you, most, most wholeheartedly.|aa
Well that's great.|ba
It's been a pleasure talking with you.|fc
You too,|fc

Thanks for call.|ft
have a good day.|fc
You too.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
he did really decide to go?|qy^d
Uh-huh,|aa
sure|aa
I'm familiar with it,|sd
and it was a very difficult choice|sd
And he, well, he must know, is he interested in law or medicine,|qy
he must have a definite profession in mind.|qy^d
Oh, okay,|bk
Medium size,|sd
aren't they?|^g
Is he excited?|qy
Very excited,|sd
Wow,|ba
I can,|%
I, -|%
Uh-huh|b
while they're east coast, I mean, I don't know anything about their football,|sd
but there you go.|h
Well, they're, they're, they're really very strong academic rather than, you know, big sports,|sd
Yeah,|b
that's, -|%
where, where you at?|qw
We're outside of, uh, Washington in Maryland.|sd
How about you?|qo
Oh, okay,|bk
I'm in, uh, suburban Dallas.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
do you have children in, -|qy
No,|nn
I don't,|sd
I have a husband|sd
We don't have any kids yet.|sd
Okay, um,|b
About all I can say is I guess about picking schools, um, I guess, uh, if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program is a good idea.|sv
Well, I, I, -|%
one of the, the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job --|sd
This is true,|aa
-- uh, but what you can't learn, uh, on a job, is a good solid well-, well-rounded education.|sd
Right,|aa
the humanities, the history, yeah,|bf
That's right, you know,|aa
the Renaissance man --|sd
Right,|aa
right,|aa
no,|%
no,|%
no|%
-- and, uh, and if you get that you can,|sv
and if you do well, you can, you can learn a job,|sv
Yeah,|b
but they, you know, if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school --|sv
That's exactly right.|aa
That's right.|aa
And, -|%
So the advice we gave to them --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
This, this is true,|aa
Yes.|b
And if you want to go away,|^2
right,|^g
-- do you want to go away,|^q
how far from home do you want to be.|^q
Right.|b
What do you want in a college.|^q
Now my son is a national level competitive swimmer --|sd
Good.|ba
-- so he wanted to swim in school,|sd
but he did not want to be in a swim factory.|sd
Okay.|b
So he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at, they'd, in Austin, Texas, University of Texas,|bf
That's right,|aa
that's the University of Texas at Austin, or --|sd
Right.|b
Texas Aqua-, -|b^m
yeah,|b
Okay,|b
well that's, I think the other thing is, too, um, I know I went to a, uh, city high school in Chicago --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say, my brother and I were,|sd
and economics was the choice --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- um, sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school.|sv
He is very, very strong academically,|sd
yeah,|%
so, we've just, -|%
but, you know, he had to look to see --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and yet he, he did wind up having to make a choice.|sd
He did apply to a large, you know, large group,|sd
Yeah,|b
University of Penn, -|sd
I'm originally from Pennsylvania.|sd
Pennsyl-, University of Pennsylvania, -|sd
It's got about nine thousand undergraduate.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's strong,|sv
I mean that's --|%
Yeah,|b
Yeah.|b
-- and it's, it's, well, it's a little bit, I don't want to use the word wilder, that's not the word I want. Um, more diverse|sv
Yes,|aa
and it, but it does have the under, you know, -|sd
that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school, so that the, uh, the college of arts and sciences is, you know, I guess about four thousand.|sd
At Williams or Pennsylvania?|qy
At Williams, -|qy
At Pennsylvania.|sd
At Pennsylvania.|b^m
Well how large is Williams?|qw
Williams is an undergraduate school only --|sd
Right.|b
-- um, and it's a total of two thousand.|sd
Well that's not bad.|ba
Yeah,|aa
so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is --|sd
Which is a lot, -|^2
Yeah.|b
-- and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- but he did go on college visits,|sd
and he liked, -|sd
That's the thing to do,|sv
I mean, I, not having any children, my husband was an Ohio State person,|sd
and, uh, that has something like either the first or second largest student population, like fifty thousand.|sd
Yes,|aa
yes --|aa
Combined . -|sd
-- it's large,|sv
and they, both boys had decided no, that they did not want that.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that is too much,|sv
and I mean, I, um, I can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because I spent a year at Bennington in Vermont,|sv
Oh, it's, -|%
so you, -|%
Um, and that was, this was twenty years ago|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Showing my age, -|sd
And did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner?|qy
Yes.|ny
Oh my God,|ba
where are you from,|qw
well, let's not talk about that|ad
No|aa
but we've been there when whose gone up there. -|sd
It's, um, in that area.|sd
I mean I just can't say enough about it.|sd
Oh, it's, it -|sd
we went|sd
and he was, you know, impressed by the clean air|sd
and he, he met the students at both schools|sd
and he liked them.|sd
Well you know, um, my husband's an engineer and a strong , a strong liberal arts background with, uh, a graduate degree in a technical field --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's it.|aa
The thing is if, if a person really knows very early on --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and they usually,|^2
but they usually don't.|sv
but, uh, for, if you're going into, -|sv
if you know engineering is the thing if, then you've got to at least take engineering.|sv
Right,|aa
but they, -|sd
no|%
but who does.|qh
I mean, I think,|sv
That's right.|aa
No|%
he looked at criteria such as location, size of school --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
No|%
he didn't apply to any school further,|sd
the furthest away was Bowdoin, in Maine which is about twelve hours.|sd
That's still pretty far though.|sv
I mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go,|sv
Yeah,|b
that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours|sd
and Williams is about seven.|sd
Oh, that's not too bad.|ba
Yeah|aa
so, well, I mean he, so it wasn't, -|%
he, you know, -|%
then the University of Pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train|sd
and then Bucknell in mid-state Pennsylvania.|sd
Yeah,|b
he will enjoy Williams I think and is a good academic,|sv
Yeah,|aa
and he will,|sd
and if, it came down I mean, as he, he came, -|sd
he's been talking to them|sd
and,|sd
and one of the things that he said is, he went to Pennsylvania this weekend|sd
and he had an absolutely marvelous time --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- he had a great time|sd
but then he said, you know, it was such a good time that I almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun.|sd
That could very well be|sv
and,|sv
and he said it almost back-, -|sd
I think it backfired.|sd
That's good because --|sv
So. -|%
well actually that's one of the reasons I went to , -|sd
Kenyon, he we-, he made a good choice.|sv
I went, -|sd
I, well I was supposed to,|sd
but I spent a year in Vermont, my freshman year,|sd
it was just too far away,|sd
it was too different --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and their attitudes was just, um, beyond my,|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Of course, that period too was probably difficult.|sv
Right,|aa
yeah,|aa
you're right|sv
but then I went, -|sd
But I did, uh,|sd
my advice to him,|sd
Yeah.|b
He had to look at himself.|sd
Uh, in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it, he could probably slip|sd
and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And you're going to get a little bit more input than --|sd
That's, -|%
yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
yeah.|%
And a swim coach is going to be right on top of you, uh, so that,|sd
and he will know the professors in a small, -|sd
Well I don't know how to put this either in this way|h
and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this|sv
but I just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today, I think the refinement that they get --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
and, um, -|%
And, um, and it's just the personal contact where if you need help -- -|sd
That's right.|aa
-- he had, -|%
I told him to look to yourself.|sd
Are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says I've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred --|^q
Right .|b
Yeah.|b
-- but if it's a class of fifteen --|^q
This is very, very, -|sv
Oh.|b
-- and even though they may break it up into smaller groups Penn is known for having --|sd
They have video lectures.|^2
Yeah.|b
Video lectures.|b^m
They have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups.|sd
This is true,|aa
and I mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the, -|sv
did he just make the decision today?|qy
he made the decision, uh, I'd say, about, uh, an hour and a half ago|sd
How funny|ba
Yeah,|aa
I mean, that's so funny. I mean,|sv
and, and, in fact, he had just an hour before that two, uh, recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him --|sd
That's funny.|ba
-- and, uh, I mean, and he, they were really nice,|sd
and, but he said is, that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know,|sd
but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better.|sd
It was easy for him to rule out.|bf
He knew what he didn't want -- -|bf
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
-- that's exactly, -|sv
yeah.|%
Now is your other, -|qy
I mean we're talking about what you think,|sd
but obviously you're experiencing it. Uh,|sd
Did your other son, um, -|qy
My other son is just as happy as a bed bug.|sd
A clam.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
He, -|%
the moment he knew, he, he decided early on that Amherst was the school.|sd
He's a classical guitarist --|sd
Oh, wonderful.|ba
-- and he decided, he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but he decided he was going to go to the, um --|sd
The smaller and the, -|^2
And they'll do fine in their studies,|sv
and I'm sure they'll go on to graduate school,|sv
Well, he's really, my older boy's real happy,|sd
and he's minoring in English,|sd
and he had thought about economics,|sd
and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't, -|sd
or is this early admissions?|qrr
He's, um, he's going to be a junior.|sd
He'll be, he's finishing his sophomore year --|sd
So he's,|bf
well sounds like you have two talented sons.|sv
Well, you know, see the advice we give is to not limit yourself, especially this, you know, go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two.|sd
I think, and a lot of people talk about, -|sv
and it's not the economics I solely zeroed in on,|sd
but I think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- and I think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller coll-, colleges because of that,|sv
and I think it's rather sad,|sv
Well, one of the things we said is that they should pick the college,|sd
this was our advice, too, irrespective of the cost. That somehow we would manage.|sd
You are wonderful parents|sv
Well, we place a real high priority on education in our family.|sd
No,|b
and I agree,|aa
I mean, my husband and I, -|sd
in fact, I'm taking my L S A T -s, um,|sd
I'm thirty something --|sd
Oh, good,|ba
that's wonderful.|ba
Oh, that's great.|ba
The point being, and your sons will learn this from you, I'm sure, that, uh, no matter what age you are, you can learn --|sv
That's right,|aa
that's exactly, -|aa
-- and, it sounds like they're going to, you know, they're, -|sv
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I guess I'll start, um,|ad
one, uh, big thing that, the advise that I would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to let their, let their child experience college in a kind of general sense.|sd
I like large colleges because I went to University of Texas at Austin,|sd
they have fifty thousand students there.|sd
And I feel like that now if I went, if I had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that I wouldn't have, have gotten as much exposure to different people and different, uh, I don't know, different languages, different cultures, and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students.|sd
That's interesting,|ba
I went to a smaller school,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And I, I thought that was the best experience in that we had more one-on-one since we seemed to know everyone on campus,|sd
Huh.|b
and we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and backgrounds,|sd
Huh.|b
so, I thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
um, one of fifty thousand, I was one of three thousand,|sd
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
I, uh, -|%
but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of, sort of thing.|sv
Yeah,|b
I, I could see, I could see that point, I could see how it would be.|sd
I'm sure your classes were a lot smaller, um, because like we would have biology classes that did, main courses that everyone has to take, I mean, hundreds of students in this class,|sd
so,|sd
Yeah.|b
But, um, I, I just, -|%
I don't know,|h
I'm thinking in a sense of, uh, just being exposed to more.|sd
It just seems like in a larger college you, I don't know, your exposed to so many more people from all over the world,|sv
and I'm sure a lot of people come to, you know, small colleges also but just that they're more of, of the different cultures there,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
not that it's, not that it's better|sv
but I'm just saying that I think that big, -|sv
That's one thing to definitely consider.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
I think, uh, a lot of, a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college,|sv
a lot of the students that I talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor, um, they,|sd
or they're considering going to Baylor,|sd
they're also considering going to U T Austin|sd
but one of the big no-nos is because of the fifty thousand students,|sd
and I have to tell them that just like, just like I live in Waco|sd
it's a large city,|sd
I can still function, in my own kind of area, in my own group.|sd
I have a job,|sd
I have my friends,|sd
Uh-huh|b
and I'm really not as, as concerned about the entire city, so when you go to a big, a big university, you're not as concerned about the entire university,|sd
Yeah.|b
I think that's probably keyed to me is not so much the size the school,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this, um, larger university setting,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
They needed, uh, at least at first,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
right.|b
Right.|b
Right.|b
and so maybe to me the key would be wh-, what is a chi-, the, the students needs,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it's these other things that you and I are, are keying off on,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but they're the things that don't show up in, -|sv
On paper.|^2
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
Uh-huh,|aa
exactly.|aa
That's, that's one important thing that I think about school.|sv
I'm, I'm not a kind a person that, -|sd
I didn't, -|sd
I, I was kind of a B student, I guess you'd say,|sd
and I didn't really, -|sd
I was tur-, -|%
I strived to be an A student|sd
but it wasn't like a real priority.|sd
Right.|b
To my, my priority was just being as worldly as I could possibly be getting into as many organizations as I possibly could,|sd
and, and one other point I was going to make, was that I can un-, I can see that probably if I had gone to a smaller school, I would probably have more friends,|sd
Huh.|b
Yeah.|b
and so, you probably come out of it knowing, and by friends, I mean, like contacts for when you get out of school, um, you know,|sv
you just, you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
You may have gone to school with them|sv
but you wouldn't, you wouldn't know them.|sv
Uh, I guess, let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college, um,|^h
I guess, I guess now I've been out for, -|sd
I, I'm older than you.|sd
I've been out for twenty-one years.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I was looking at an annual last night,|sd
something had sp-, it sparked a question,|sd
and I went to a small private school,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
um, and it was church related.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I got to looking at my class of sixty-nine,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here|sd
and I've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years, where I go to church now, there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as I,|sd
Wow.|ba
and it's, it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same memories if not the same education in, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
you know, we weren't all out to be teachers or, or whatever|sd
so we didn't have the same classes,|sd
but we had a common thread,|sd
Right.|b
Wow.|ba
That's great.|ba
And it's, it's, it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things, those are what I carry beyond that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at T I,|sd
Right,|b
right.|b
I have something more important to me than that.|sd
That's great,|ba
that's great.|ba
Yeah,|%
that's what I, that's basically what I, and, when I first, -|sd
I've been out of college only two years now, so it's still pretty fresh on my memory,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but now that I'm out, -|sd
when I went into school, my parents told, well, -|sd
my, -|%
okay, let me, let me go back to my, my sister now is in college,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and, and I kept pushing her towards just kind of U T or a larger school,|sd
and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics|sd
and I wanted her to get the life experience,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and so it was, you know, -|sd
she went the academic way because she's a straight A student, which is, -|sd
I was going to ask who won|sd
yes,|b
yeah,|b
so, she, you know, -|%
that's probably, you know, what she, what she wants anyway|sd
but that was the big deal|sd
and, -|%
In, in that case, uh, regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed,|sv
Right.|b
Right.|b
And that, that's another point is that, the, a parent should tell their child to be or, or to give their child the leeway to choose their school,|sv
Yeah.|b
I think it helps,|sv
a, now my grandfather was going to pay if I went to, uh, what's now U T Arlington,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I could live at home.|sd
Right.|b
But I chose to go to another school|sd
and even though he was pleased that it was a church related school, he was not willing to pay any at all even the same amount of money,|sd
Huh.|b
and I think I value my, my education more because I had to work for it.|sd
uh-huh.|b
And because I knew all along that's what I wanted,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
Right.|b
Well, that was pretty courageous|sv
Um, I guess, I guess it was, it was my mother's support that got me through it,|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh, yeah,|ba
yeah.|b
I'm, I'm dealing with the loans right now,|sd
Sounds familiar, huh?|qy
Your, -|%
it's very fresh in your memory.|qy^d
very,|sd
every, every month|sd
I, -|%
That memory just seeps back in my mailbox.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, sorry about that Tanya|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Oh, well, I guess I'll get over it.|bd
I'm sure it was worth it though.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Okay.|%
If, if nothing else because I work in training at T I now,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
if nothing else just those experiences beyond and, and including your educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and the, you, you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to make, to give you the, the potential to do whatever you wanted.|sv
Right,|aa
because when you, when you do want, when you do finally graduate that, that's what you need the most.|sv
I'm finding out now that what I'm needing the most now is not smarts, not what I can do on paper, it's stamina, courage, uh, , -|sd
Young lady,|sv
words, it, -|sd
that, that's right.|aa
Yes,|aa
I'm needing, you know, my, I'm needing to rely on myself,|sd
Yeah.|b
And I think I learned a lot of that in school too.|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
there we go.|sd
Okay,|b
great.|ba
So, do you play golf at all?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I do,|sd
I'm a player.|sd
I'm kind of embarrassed I'm talking to a man, cause I'm sure that you are, you play a lot more than I do.|sd
Actually, I don't.|sd
Oh, really.|bh
No,|nn
uh, I, uh, when I was younger, I played a little bit|sd
and I was horrible,|sd
so I just stopped playing.|sd
Oh, well, my husband is, is a very good golfer.|sd
He has got, like a six handicap.|sd
Wow,|ba
that is real good.|sv
So, uh, -|%
and he has been playing since we have been married for twenty two years.|sd
So, I had to start playing because, he was, you know, such an avid golfer.|sd
So, I have been playing now, -|sd
well I have had clubs for twenty years, you know.|sd
Wow,|ba
so you have been playing,|bf
But, but, I really enjoy it.|sd
So, I had to check that and, and, uh, talk about it.|sd
Well, have you played recently?|qy
No,|nn
actually, I don't even know if I checked that or not, to be perfectly honest. Um|sd
Oh|b
That seems to have been a mistake,|sd
I don't know. Um.|h
Oh, that's okay.|bd
Yeah,|aa
I have not played in a long time.|sd
Um, when I was, -|sd
about five or six years ago, my dad , who plays every now and then took me out with him|sd
and, and I basically, um, I had a horrible slice or hook,|sd
I forget which one it was.|sd
Yeah.|b
It wound up tossing the ball into the trees,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
the slice goes to the right|sd
and the hook goes to the left,|sd
I think.|h
Yes,|aa
I was slicing, actually.|sd
Yeah.|b
And,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
I went and took some lessons,|sd
and a I got a little bit better,|sd
but I st-, but then I sort of, you know, went, went back to school and did not have time and this and that,|sd
and, and the only thing I do now is I occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what I can do.|sd
And I,|sd
Yeah,|b
I think that's really a good thing to do.|sv
So, where,|qw
I mean, are you in school?|qy
I'm a graduate student,|sd
yeah.|%
Oh, okay,|bk
at the University of Rochester?|qy
Yes.|ny
Oh, great.|ba
As a matter of fact, um, so I don't have time to do much else, except for graduate work.|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Right,|b
so I hang around this way,|sd
and I, -|%
Sure.|b
Occasionally, uh, uh, -|%
a bunch of us were pretty avid golfers.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we will, we will, we will play, you know.|sd
And you don't,|qy^d
I have, I have very litt-, at the moment I have very little playing time.|sd
When I, when I go on vacation, my father and I, uh --|sd
Yes.|b
But, I don't, you know, -|sd
we play a par, a par three, nine hole course.|sd
Because,|%
Oh, that's my favorite kind to play.|sd
Because, for a woman, it's really nice to play a par three course because,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, in fact, I don't even like to use a driver,|sd
I use a three iron off the tee --|sd
Um.|%
Uh-huh.|b
And, I can, I can just have better contact with the ball that way.|sd
So, I'm still using a three iron|sd
and my husband is trying to get me into using a, you,|sd
Right.|b
But, those are, uh, still not you favorite, huh?|qy
No,|nn
it's not my favorite,|sd
but, I, I, uh, I enjoy,|sd
I, I really do,|sd
I think I'm going to like golf the older I get,|sd
I, we have three teenage daughters.|sd
Uh, wow, .|ba
One is, -|sd
You must be very busy.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I'm very busy,|sd
I have a part time job|sd
and, and during the year, I don't play much golf|sd
but, but, when I'm, we are on vacation, I love to play. Just like you said.|sd
Um.|%
And, we got to play in Monterrey in California, right, you know, along the Pacific Ocean, this past spring.|sd
And that was, I told my husband, that was the way to play, you know,|sd
that was, -|sd
if I could play there every time I want, it was, it was great.|sd
A neat experience -|sd
Miniature golf, there's my game. Uh.|sd
Miniature golf is great,|sv
yes.|aa
Miniature golf, there you go, putt, putt.|sd
Well, that's the thing my kids like to do that with, you know, on dates and stuff.|sd
Uh.|%
But, golf is um, -|sd
we, we probably are talking about golf because I did check it You know .|sv
I don't, I don't, I don't -|%
I may have, actually, I may have just checked random things.|sd
I don't, I don't recall anymore.|sd
Well, yeah,|b
if you ever played, -|sd
I mean, I feel like anybody that's ever played golf can talk about it|sv
and maybe if you can even talk about it, if you, if you have, uh, watched it on T V.|sv
Right.|aa
Yeah,|aa
actually, we have a very very, um, -|sd
we had the, uh, -|sd
Yeah,|b
tell me about your clubs up there.|ad
What, -|%
Well, we had, -|sd
I haven't played around here too much.|sd
We have a very good one called Locust Hill though.|sd
There, uh, the L-, -|%
Locust Hill?|br
Yeah,|aa
the L P G A comes here every year --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
right.|b
And then we had a P G A, actually, a very big P G A, uh, tour stop here, last year.|sd
Oh, great.|ba
And, actually, um, they say the, the, -|sd
I have not played the course,|sd
but, they say the course is very, is, is, is pretty tough, pretty challenging.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it's, um, not only that,|sd
but, it's exceedingly well kept, apparently.|sd
Oh, yeah.|ba
Because, th-, those are the comments I kept hearing from the pros, you know,|sd
they kept saying, we hear, you know, on, on television I, -|sd
but, they keep saying it's just wonderful, uh,|sd
the course is so well maintained|sd
and, you know, it, it, it rained through half the um, tournament, so people had to , -|sd
but, they still, -|sd
the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about,|sd
Oh, yeah.|ba
And this, -|%
actually, when, when the, um, when the L P G A came here --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, sure.|aa
You know. It's all over the news,|sd
and --|sd
Yes.|b
Yeah.|b
To watch them,|^2
yeah.|%
The ladies, -|^2
So, I mean, I think it's actually, it's absolutely wonderful to see.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here.|sv
Yeah,|b
uh. -|%
People are just cra-, -|sv
golf is just, -|sv
it's just the coming thing,|sv
I mean a lot of people are just crazy about it.|sv
It seems to be.|aa
It seems a lot of people are really, you know, -|sv
either, um, either you have not played it, or, or you, you have played it|sv
and you sort of stink, like me,|sd
Well,|sv
and you sort of play every now and then.|sv
I mean it's, I just, I watch my husband|sd
and he's, he was a professional athlete,|sd
he, he's a very good athlete|sd
and he's got the coordination, that God given coordination,|sd
and he just struggles,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
well, same here, I mean, I'm a brown belt in Karate at this point in time.|sd
And, uh,|sd
Oh my, really!|ba
Yeah.|b
You know I, -|%
Because it, -|%
well, I watch my husband swing|sd
and his swing, you know, like compared to the pros, is so, it's ridged.|sd
It's like he's trying so hard, it's not that flowing movement.|sd
Right.|b
That's because he's probably doing what I do, worrying about,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Or, how far he's going to hit it, I think, you know.|bf
oh yeah.|aa
And I worry about that.|sd
Oh, yeah.|aa
I have just got to get this drive, you know, really far,|sd
I have got to hit it.|sd
Yeah.|b
So. -|%
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
I have this nasty habit of of turning my head at the last second, or,|sd
Yep,|b
or, -|%
Yeah,|aa
turning your head is probably the most common thing for women,|sd
Is it?|qy
And you are always so anxious to see where it goes.|sv
Right,|aa
exactly.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Exactly,|aa
It's just like I, I don't watch the ball die,|sd
I have . -|sd
It took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before I looked up.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
I have to that, especially, even more so, with a short iron than a long ir-, you know,|sd
Oh, driver.|^2
Because, those short irons, it's just, you want to look up --|sv
Yeah.|b
and you want to see it hit the green.|sv
And you know that's why, -|sv
Watch where it's going.|bf
Yeah,|b
so.|sd
That, that is certainly true|aa
thank you .|ft
am I supposed to ask questions about this whole procedure,|qy
I know that.|sd
That's okay,|aa
go ahead,|ad
it's no big deal.|bd
Well, uh, when I, -|sd
do you get, get, um, reimbursed for the calls you make or the calls you talk on too?|qy
Both.|sd
Both.|b
Okay.|bk
I believe so.|sd
Okay,|b
well I really did not know so I, -|sd
I, I, I actually don't know,|sd
I get a random reimbursement every now and then and don't really --|sd
Yeah.|b
Okay.|b
Cause this is only my second day doing it|sd
and I just did not, I did not know|sd
and that was .|sd
Oh, really.|b
we, I just started yesterday.|sd
I have been doing this for awhile, actually.|sd
Have you?|bh
It seems like it's been a while.|na
Yeah.|b
And they just, I just,|sd
I had a , -|sd
and, -|%
I see.|bk
My wife and I both do it, as a matter of fact.|sd
I see.|bk
And we both just, sort of, get these random checks in the mail|sd
and,|sd
Yeah.|b
I just sort of figured, well, it's going to work.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, if it works, it works.|sd
So , -|%
Well, my, uh, -|%
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
do you, uh, think we should go metric?|qy
Well, I, I, oh, I don't know.|no
It's kind of a tricky question, because I think it's, it's a practical system,|sv
Yeah.|b
obviously, if it's all compatible and it, you know, tens -|sv
and things make sense.|sv
Um, it's, it's a switch.|sv
The problem would just be the switch over.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I think that the, I think what, -|sv
I mean, I don't know what happened last time.|sd
I remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something|sd
and, -|%
Right.|aa
That's when I was in the elementary school years|sd
and we all,|sd
Yeah,|aa
me too.|sd
and they were ready,|sd
we were going to be metric|sd
and, -|%
Right,|aa
and, and I don't quite know why it failed.|sd
Um, I would bet the push, I, it, I bet the push just wasn't big enough.|sv
Right.|b
You know, they didn't sort of encourage, I mean businesses and things to use it,|sd
so, you know, what, what I think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while, and then, and then start phasing things out|sv
so, -|%
So I think that's what they did at first,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, and I mean, and there's things that we've gone metric.|sd
We have metric cola now,|sd
Right,|aa
I was just thinking,|sd
you can buy that|sd
and you can, -|sd
You don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda.|sd
So that, you know, so that, we have little things that are metric,|sd
but no one talks about, you know, uh, -|sd
you buy nine by twelve frames,|sd
you don't buy centimeter length frames,|sd
Right.|b
And, and, and even though the car says miles and kilometers, -|sd
you don't say, -|sd
I went,|^q
Uh-huh .|b
Right,|b
fifty-nine kilometers per gallon.|sd
Yeah.|aa
I would, I would be total loss.|sd
Yeah.|b
That's, -|%
I think, I think, though, if there were some, you know, sort of government incentive program or something --|sv
Right.|b
and I think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed|sv
and, pardon my expression there, but, uh,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But I think in the end it would make life a lot easier for --|sv
Yeah,|aa
it really would.|sv
It's, I, I, it's, because I think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools, trying to, you know, get that in our minds, so that we could ch-, I mean|sv
because I think our generation could make a change.|sv
Yeah.|b
It would be difficult,|sv
but it would not be as difficult for people, say, fifty years old now who are, have never been exposed to the metric system other than, you know, buying a two liter Coke.|sv
Right.|b
That's -|%
Well, what I think, I think the difference between now and then might be, this is just a might, is we were the first generation that was in elementary school.|sv
Right.|b
And if they kept it up, -|sv
so let's say, imagine they had kept going,|sd
you'd have, you know, two or three more generations that all now are, are familiar with the metric system.|sd
Right.|b
Not like could use it comfortably right now, -|sv
but I could convert, you know,|sd
I could carry around a little conversion card or something|sd
and,|sd
Right|b
and I think that before, it was just, you know, just a bunch of little kids using it.|sv
Right.|b
And now I think there are enough people, -|sv
you know, sort of as we get older, I think others that will bring more generations in on it, eventually they'll be able to make the switch,|sv
and we're not going to start going crazy and yelling and saying,|sv
We'll say oh, it's a pain in the neck,|sv
but it's for the better|^q
and we'll sort of deal with it, I think.|sv
That's true.|aa
That makes sense.|sv
I don't know.|h
I, I, I would hope it would, uh,|sd
it seems like it's a reasonable system.|sv
I mean, everything seems to be based on the same thing.|sv
Well, I was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change,|sd
and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license.|sd
Right|b
When you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore, uh, you'd be a hundred and seventy centimeters,|sd
Centimeters.|b^m
and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in --|sd
Yeah.|b
But I wonder if, if, -|sd
So all the dieters would be happy|sv
But yeah|b
right|b
I only weigh sixteen today.|^q
That's, -|%
Yeah.|b
But I wonder if that's even something that, you know, they, they have to change immediately.|sd
They could just, you know, sort of phase that in,|sv
so start, you know, from now,|sv
like from now on all licenses would have that,|sv
Right.|b
And they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that,|sv
That's right.|aa
I know the, -|sd
and, oh, yeah,|%
I know, though, at the, uh, at the amusement parks, they say if you're under forty-two,|sd
Right.|b
You have to be under.|^q
Well, I guess what, what, I bet what they do in that case, they, uh, -|sd
see, what some of them is like, you know, they say if you're not taller than this line.|sd
Right.|aa
this line, which is seventy-three centimeters.|^q
That's right.|aa
Just so you'll know,|^q
It would be a neat case where like, where kids taught the parents, I think, you know.|sv
Right.|aa
Because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world?|qy
I know England is not metric.|sd
But I don't know.|no
I,|sd
Eng-, Eng-, England is not?|qy^d
Oh.|b
all that began back there,|sd
and I think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric.|sd
Yeah,|b
but I mean, -|%
but, but virtually the rest of the world is.|sd
I mean, it seems like --|sv
Right.|b
I mean, we are, of course, we are Americans|sd
and we're supposed to be, you know, -|sv
We're the trend setters in the world.|^2
I don't know why we,|sd
That's right,|aa
and, and now we're backwards.|sv
I don't know.|h
No,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I, I, I would think, I mean, a, a, a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system --|sv
Right.|b
Well, and it's not even base twelve for everything,|sd
is it?|^g
It, -|%
No,|nn
actually, no.|nn
Um, let's see,|^h
it's, -|%
Well, pounds,|sd
I don't even know what that, -|sd
I don't know.|h
Oh, yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I, I always forget.|sd
I don't even know how many ounces are in a pound.|sd
I just sort of make it up.|sd
See, and I don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces.|sd
It's, -|%
I mean, I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current measuring system that would|sd
Right|b
Those, those wouldn't be a problem.|sv
It's not like it's really entrenched other, you know. -|sv
A lot of stuff, -|sv
Let's see,|^h
how many cups equal that?|qh
I, I have no idea.|sd
I just, uh, -|%
I know things like, you know, a pint is a pound the world around or something.|sd
Right|b
I don't,|sd
That's all I know.|sd
I, I learned that because, uh, a friend of mine, -|sd
I, I had two friends,|sd
and, I had more friends than that,|sd
but two friends of mine in college, -|sd
I had a lot more than two,|sd
I promise.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Well, that's good.|ba
Um, we opened a jelly bean business.|sd
Oh.|b
And we sold jelly beans,|sd
and we had, uh, no idea how many, you know, -|sd
we, we didn't bo-, we didn't bother buying a scale.|sd
Right.|b
We'd go out and just buy, you know, five pound bags of sixteen different flavors, put it in plastic shoe boxes and, and, and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something.|sd
Right.|b
And we, we didn't bother buying a scale,|sd
and one of my friends was a physics, one of these guys was a physics major|sd
and he said, well, just remember a pint is a pound the world around,|sd
and he got the measuring cup and just measured, I think a cup or two cup, whatever is a pint.|sd
Did you ever check it to see if it really was,|qy
Gee, I think, wh-,|sd
and it turns out that he was actually pretty close.|sd
Um.|%
If anything, we were actually in favor of the consumer.|sd
Right.|b
So, so we were giving them a little too much,|sd
but that was our general tendency anyway.|sd
Well, that's, -|%
you all are nice business -|sv
Yeah,|aa
well, we were, you know, we were in, -|sd
it was, it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school,|sd
we really didn't,|sd
Right.|b
I think we were only making seventy-five dollars each profit at the end of the year.|sd
Right|b
but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it.|sd
Probably ate all your merchandise too.|sv
Yeah,|aa
we, we, we tended to eat a lot,|sd
and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it,|sd
and we had another friend, um, the physics major again, he wasn't --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and he got into a snowball fight,|sd
and he just, -|sd
and, and some snow fell into one of the cartons.|sd
Oh.|b
So he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off|sd
And basically what we had, sort of non coated beans at that point.|sd
Yeah,|aa
it's a little problem.|sv
What's inside the jelly bean?|qw
Uh, it's just, uh, it's just the, the same, -|sd
they're like an outer coating,|sd
and there's just sort of th-, this stuff you see, you know, it's sort of like glorified sugar.|sd
I don't know.|h
Uh, oh.|b
But when you rinse them off, all you get is, uh, is, uh, the coating,|sd
Lucille Hughes.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Okay,|b
Lucille, I'm on, on . -|sd
All right,|b
and what, -|%
And our top-, okay, our topic was, -|sd
did you hear our topic?|qy
Yes.|ny
All right,|aa
basketball.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I guess I'm probably a lot like you.|sv
I'm a Dallas Maverick fan.|sd
Well, I certainly am too.|sd
Now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year.|ad
Well, unfortunately, I don't expect a great deal out of them.|sd
They just have too many problems, too many ailments, too many hurt bones, and maybe too much age at this point.|sv
You know, when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them, it just hurt them so bad.|sv
I feel --|sd
Um.|%
I feel sorry for Donald Carter and the members of the team and the management team and everyone else.|sd
It just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final, a final team playing for all of it.|sv
Yes, sir.|aa
National championship or the world championship, and something like this happens.|sd
Oh.|b
Well, do you think it's time that we go for new, uh, coaches?|qy
Is that part of our problem?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I think at this time, we're just in a, a rebuilding type of phase, you know.|sv
I think that probably be evident with the more and more, the more and more young guys they draft.|sv
But, -|%
Well, it just, it's so discouraging that they can't really, -|sv
I mean, they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far.|sv
I, I'm awfully sorry that the Mavericks can't come on and, and do.|sd
Roy, who's your next best team,|qw
or who do you like after the Mavericks?|qw
Oh, gosh,|ba
I'm so much a Maverick, Maverick fan I don't know.|sd
Probably the Boston Celtics.|sd
I've just always like the Boston Celtics.|sd
They have a, they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team,|sv
and, but they're still playing good ball.|sv
Well. -|%
But I'm, I've always been a Boston Celtic fan, too,|sd
but, you know, I've lived in Texas since seventy-four,|sd
so being a transplanted Texan in, in the Dallas area, I have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks.|sd
We certainly need to support them,|sv
do we not.|^g
Yes,|ny
we do. You know.|sd
Do you go to the game?|qy
Yes,|ny
I go to a few games.|sd
I haven't been to many.|sd
I'm not a season ticket holder or anything.|sd
I was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years,|sd
and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing, sort of gets boring going by yourself|sd
Yes,|aa
it does|sv
I'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down there.|sv
Oh, you bet.|aa
But, um, maybe next, maybe they can do some.|sv
I don't know,|h
who do they need to trade?|qw
Well, I don't know.|no
It seems like Rolando Blackman and, and Harper sort of carry the team,|sv
they just, -|%
I don't know,|h
I'm afraid to say, that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good,|sv
but, and that can really help the team,|sv
but they do that,|sv
they trade the nucleus of their power right now.|sv
Yes, sir,|aa
it seems that way to me.|sd
I, course I don't know any of the newer ones that they have|sd
and I'm not well versed on their capabilities,|sd
but we really need to do something.|sv
Well, you know, I feel like, uh, the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs.|sd
I like their coach.|sd
I really like a lot, -|sd
and I just, I think he deserves a good break.|sv
I think he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club.|sv
I think Donald Carter, the owner, I think with all he's invested, he deserves a --|sv
I really. -|%
Yes, sir.|ba
This thing with Roy Tarpley just upset everyone, I think. Fans, owners, management, everyone.|sv
And they have just done as much as they can for that man,|sv
and he apparently can't straighten his act out,|sd
so we need to, to build on something more positive than that.|sv
You bet.|aa
I think they're fools if they ever bring him back|sv
Oh, I do, too.|aa
I certainly would agree to that.|sd
Hate to put it that way.|sd
I just would not believe him any more.|sd
Well, it, um, -|%
I mean, you can't give, anyone too many chances --|sv
No.|aa
-- and I think he has gone over the limit.|sv
There's an old saying you can, you can lead a horse to water|sd
but you can't make him drink.|^q
So, -|%
That's right.|aa
And I think Tarpley's just a sad case.|sv
Well. -|%
But to be making a, a million dollars a year, that's pretty sad.|sv
It is tragic.|aa
I don't, um, -|%
I mean, we're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes, I think.|sv
Oh, I think you're right.|aa
Everything has been put out of perspective now.|sv
You know, you take a, a young kid Roy Tarpley's age, I'd say he was twenty-one when he came into the league,|sd
and now he's probably an old age of, uh, twenty-five or six --|sd
Yes, sir.|ba
well, that's, uh, that's quite a, that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they, they need at that point in their life, I think.|sv
I think you're right.|aa
I believe that one,|sd
so. -|%
I think, you know, it's created by, -|sv
Alright Allen.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Uh, the questions is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know, in their, the society we live in.|sd
What do you think has occurred there?|qw
Well, I think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home.|sv
That's probably one of the major changes I see over the last period of time.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But are, are they being given the full honor for the work they are doing and for the, uh, oh my gosh, I can't think of the word, but for the, what they have to accept that's they are responsible for.|qh
Uh, responsibilities is what I am trying to say.|sd
Oh, I don't think so.|ng
I think it has come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- but I still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals.|sv
In other words, in some respects the other direction, in some job markets they don't really want to be treated as equals.|sv
By the same token, most, in most cases, women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who have been there before, but at lower salaries.|aap_am
Yes|aa
I think that's --|aa
Is that right and wrong?|qy
And I think that's what we really ought to look at that, going is, if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay.|sv
Yes.|aa
And that, uh, they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I don't think that we have gotten there yet.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years?|qw
Any individual thing --|qy^d
Oh, boy.|ba
-- or is it just a general switch over?|qrr
I think it's generally that switch over.|sv
And, and I think that switch over has been more in the work force.|sv
I don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force.|sv
I think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So they have one and three quarters jobs now. Whereas the husbands have one and a quarter.|sv
Yeah.|b
and this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household.|sv
So do you think that is going to be uh, difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other --|qy
Yes.|ny
Yeah.|ny
I think also in terms of parenting.|sv
I think there is going to be some increasing problem because I think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting|sv
and I am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So I think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units.|sv
Well, do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation,|qy
Well, I, I think one of the things that always happens is I think is when the one end wh-, you know were moving out to the end where a lot of women will be at work --|na
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then I think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties|sv
and so the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is cracked up to be|sv
and I want to go back and do something else.|sv
I think we will probably see the sw-, pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Also, much of it is driven by economics right now.|sv
Yes.|aa
People have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in.|sv
Well, I actually, mo-, -|%
a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they are going to get.|sv
Yeah.|b
And the people. -|sv
Well, how do you feel about women in, uh, armed services?|qw
Well, I think they ought to have the right.|sv
I have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to com-, or my wife and my daughter going into combat --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- but I have problems with men doing that|sv
and I guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it.|sv
Um.|b
It's nothing I would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it.|sd
Yeah.|b
I somehow can't do that|ar
I,|sd
and the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money, bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household|sd
and it, it really still bothers me.|sd
I spent plenty of years in the service,|sd
but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around.|sd
I mean how are they going to protect themselves so to speak.|qh
I agree.|aa
It puts them in a very bad situation.|sv
I, I really don't go for that.|sv
I think one of the other things that concern, has concerned me a little bit, -|sv
and I think I see some change in attitudes there.|sv
My wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and there's, uh, has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence --|sd
Yep.|b
and you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going|sv
And I hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do, that's acceptable.|sv
Yeah.|b
If they chose to go into the work force that's okay.|sv
Yeah.|b
If they chose not to, that's acceptable.|sv
And if they go into the work force, they should be treated as nicely --|sv
As equals.|^2
And, uh, not, -|%
All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
so what do you think of the Giants?|qo
Uh, I like the Giants.|sd
They got, uh, -|sd
I probably didn't get into baseball until maybe, maybe three years ago really --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- so, uh, but I, I just like the Giants.|sd
I don't, I don't know why.|sd
I really got into them.|sd
I read, uh, Dave Dreveki's book --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Yeah --|b
-- and, -|%
-- wasn't that something of him.|qh
Yeah,|ny
that, that was incredible.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's really a, -|%
really proud of him though, the way he's, you know. -|sd
The way he handled that entire situation, there.|^2
Yeah,|aa
really, you know.|aa
But, I just think the Giants have a good team.|sd
They, they got all, you know,|sd
they're, they're, they're real balanced out.|sd
They got real good pitching,|sd
and they got the hitting to go along with it.|sd
So. -|%
Yeah,|b
I just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top --|sd
Yeah,|b
they just --|sd
I don't really know what it is,|sd
but, but every team that's, that's really good seems, -|sd
you know, like the A -s had, they had, they just had it all that one year.|sd
So. -|%
Yeah,|b
um I was mostly an A -s fan, you know.|sd
I had been to more games at the A -s than I have in the Giants --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
But, uh, I still like the Giants, though, you know|sd
Yeah,|b
if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way, you know, you --|sv
Yeah,|b
right.|b
but. It's, it's kind of hard.|sd
I still, basically, the, the, -|sd
me and all my friends around here, since we don't have anywhere, -|sd
I mean, we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams,|sd
but since, no-, -|%
me, none of me and my friends are really, really like either one of those teams, -|sd
so we, uh -- -|%
Uh-huh.|b
-- about, about the most baseball we get is either T V or we play it on Nintendo.|sd
We play R B I baseball on Nintendo|sd
so.|sd
Yeah,|b
right,|b
right.|b
Yeah.|b
but. -|%
Yeah,|b
right.|b
Well, I prefer ba-, uh, football --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
so do I,|aa
but baseball is still -- -|sd
it's. -|%
-- you got, you got to do something when football ain't on.|sd
So -|%
So, hot dogs, baseball and apple pie. Huh.|bf
Yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
This is America,|sv
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
um.|b
But. -|%
So what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams?|qw
Uh, I don't know, it's hard to say.|h
I haven't really, really, -|%
you have to just keep up with everything in the off- season.|sv
It's kind of hard to do,|sd
at least, you know, --|sd
I know.|ba
but, like I say, if they can, if they can get that one element that they were missing, I think the Giants can do it.|sv
Yeah,|b
well, the Giants are. -|%
They just, -|%
I don't, -|%
yeah|%
I don't really know about the A -s.|sd
They kind of. -|%
Yeah,|b
makes you sick, doesn't it?|^2
Yeah.|aa
You hear what, you hear what, you hear what he did.|qy^d
Yes.|ny
He ramming his wife's car,|sd
and I was like, yeah.|sd
He's like a little bitty kid, huh.|sv
Yeah,|aa
he's just a, a, a little boy with a lot of money.|sv
So. -|%
Yeah|b
That's just, -|%
you know, but. -|%
Yeah,|b
well, I guess the Giants or, might move away from San Francisco, it sounds like.|sd
Yeah,|b
I've heard, I've heard talk about that.|sd
You know, uh, they won't be that far away,|sd
but San Francisco will be hurting, anyhow.|sd
Yeah,|b
they're not going to be happy about it.|sd
You know.|qy
But I hope they can do good.|sd
I mean, that's just, -|%
I think they're a good team. That just need that one, one little thing to push them over.|sd
I don't know exactly what it is.|h
They got, -|%
they're pretty balanced out all the way through.|sd
It just might be the drive, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
they just, they probably just need something to push them --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Or somebody basically, -|sd
maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it.|sd
Maybe that's what, you know, that's what some teams need.|sd
Look at the Twins going from worst to first.|sd
I know, isn't that something --|qh
Yeah,|ny
my roommate --|sd
-- I couldn't believe that, huh.|sd
so, he had his year this year,|sd
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
I just, it. -|%
We got pre-, we, we got into that a whole bunch.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
That was a, that was a series to remember, for sure.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So I saw all seven games of that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|%
yeah,|%
I couldn't believe that, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't, uh, -|%
there was Braves in that chanting that they had. -|sd
That would drive you up a wall.|sd
Yeah|b
they, -|%
every team with the Indians been doing that now.|sv
You know.|qy
I can't figure out why.|sd
You have to figure out why they're all doing that, I'm like, it's doesn't work, it's obvious it doesn't work because the, you know --|sd
Yeah,|aa
well, you're right|aa
so, uh, why keep on doing something that didn't work,|qh
but --|h
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
I was, I was kind of surprised that we were going to talk about baseball,|sd
and I get a woman's voice.|sd
I was,|sd
I talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car,|sd
so. -|%
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah,|ny
I got, I called, got a call the other night about, uh, fixing your automobile up,|sd
so. -|%
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Well, baseball's baseball.|sv
Yeah,|b
right.|b
It's kind of, -|%
I don't know, it's kind of odd they pick, -|sd
do you pick the topic or does the computer?|qy
No,|nn
uh, they give you a list of things that you want,|sd
Uh, Greg,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
uh, I, I'm not familiar.|sd
I think, uh, you guys in Indiana, don't you have the, the death penalty?|qy
Yeah,|ny
we do have the death penalty here.|sd
It's not exercised very often,|sd
but we do have it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I believe it, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I know there's a lot of, lot of problems with it,|sd
but, uh --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|aa
But, I know there's a lot of problems with that, like, well, they say, okay, if you declare someone, put them on death row and execute them, well, then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it, then that life was wasted,|sd
but --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|aa
Uh, I, I tend to agree with you,|aa
uh, I've changed my views over, uh, e-, even within the last few years, uh, to be honest.|sd
Uh, uh, when I was in coll-, when I was an undergraduate, I was a member of Amnesty International --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, and, of course, at that time, you know, I thought, uh, uh, it was stupid to kill anybody for, uh, -|sd
you know, that -|%
the eye for an eye was a stupid argument.|sv
Right.|aa
But the, uh, the more, -|sv
now I live in downtown Dallas,|sd
and I, uh, --|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
I think that maybe, uh, a good solution to capital punishment might be, uh, reserve it solely for, uh, repeat offenders of a crime like, uh, murder.|sv
That's a, that's a thought that I had never really had on that --|aa
Yeah,|b
it seems sensible and failsafe.|sv
I, I, uh, I don't, -|%
you know, not completely failsafe,|sv
but if a man's convicted of two murders, uh, you know, there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong.|sv
Right.|aa
Uh I also, uh, -|%
to tell you how liberal I have turned, uh, toward this, or, or, or whatever side that is --|sv
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and I think, I think the death penalty is the best choice for those people, because, uh, really any kind of, uh, uh, jail sentence for them is just another chance to, uh, create another power structure|sv
Yeah,|aa
you're, you're right there.|aa
Uh, I gue-, -|%
basically my views, I guess they tend to be more economically oriented --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Right.|b
I mean, I don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with --|sv
Right.|b
-- so to me I'm paying taxes, you know, twenty percent of my check or whatever --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
so I, I'm all in favor of it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, uh, do you, uh, -|qy
are there cases where you think that, that, uh, the capital, the capital punishment shouldn't be, uh, uh, sentenced?|qy
Well, I, I really don't know on that question.|h
It just seems like, -|sv
for instance, the Jeffrey Dahlmer case. I mean, I don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society.|sv
I hope the guy never gets back out on the streets --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and in that case, Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty,|sd
so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment --|sd
Right.|b
-- and I think that, that he should not be allowed to live,|sv
but, you know, then you're kind of playing God --|sv
That's true,|aa
yeah.|aa
Right.|aa
But cases where I think the death penalty should be withheld, uh, not really that I can think of.|sd
I, I would, I would be in favor of the death penalty in things like, you know, murders, and like you said, repeat murders or --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- uh, I don't really agree with the, uh, death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that.|ar
I think that they're, they're operating on a more, -|sv
I mean, I know that they're causing massive problems in society up here,|sv
but I don't really think that, that it's, it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live, because --|sv
Right.|b
Sure,|b
yeah,|b
I understand, I understand your point.|sd
Yeah.|%
Uh, of course, you know, with, uh, with, with Dahlmer now, uh, you, you realize that Ohi-, I think it's Ohio, uh, gets to try him next|qy^d
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
so, uh, that was a curious case.|sd
I. -|%
Yeah,|b
that is very curious.|sd
Uh, uh, something is sort of nightmarish --|sv
Yeah.|aa
That's, that's right.|aa
Uh, well, here in Texas we, uh, -|sd
I think even, even this last week, last week they had another, they, uh, -|sd
you know, they use their capital punishment by lethal injection, uh, uh,|sd
Okay, I guess we're on.|sd
Yeah.|b
Central America, have you ever lived in Central America.|qy
I wasn't in Central America|ng
but, uh, talking about Latin America, I kind of, I consider Latin America to include Central and South America|sd
and I did live in, uh, San Polo Brazil for four years.|sd
Do you, do you think that, that we should have given up the Panama Canal?|qy
Uh, realistically, I, -|%
yes,|ny
I don't see the, the Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not, not really big enough to, uh, accommodate the, the shipping that it once did|sv
and, uh, maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however, I think, we're certainly justified in, uh, our actions dealing with, uh, Noriega in this ...|sv
Well, there are those that, that, that think that, that, that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance, particularly for the military.|sv
Interestingly enough my father was, who was in World War One, and as, uh, as a civil engineer they, they, they offered him a commission as a captain if he would, uh, go in and, and, uh, help with the defenses of the Panama Canal.|sd
He had worked for United Fruit Company there,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they, uh, they, in fact, they had, -|sd
this was in the, the late twenties|sd
and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over|sd
and, uh, he turned them down.|sd
It, it's interesting that, that most people don't realize how small the canal is.|sd
Have you ever been there?|qy
No,|nn
I haven't.|sd
It's, it's really, -|sd
I, I haven't been there,|sd
I've been to, been to Salvador|sd
and, and, uh, in fact, we went back to visit some friends of, of my fathers, that we went in fifty-seven I guess.|sd
And interestingly enough the canal is quite small and, and realistically could be sabotaged quite, quite easily.|sv
The thing I find interesting, though, is that, uh, is the whole colonial approach|sv
and, and, and do we, do we support the Sandinistas or, or do we support, uh, -|qh
you know, when they thought, uh, they thought that Nicaragua, if you gave them a free election, they would vote for the, -|sv
Will you, uh, -|%
did you ever studied the, the political makeup there, in, in, in Nicaragua.|qy
I have a, a little bit,|na
I can't say that I'm, I would be an, an expert on, on the region,|sd
but, uh, certainly, uh, I, it, it gets, it ge-, there, -|%
your, -|%
you've got this, this toss up betw-, -|sv
or not, not so much a toss up but a, a dilemma when, when you want a country to have its, its, um, own, uh, dominion, or its free rein over its, its own people.|sv
and now we're, we're in this dilemma over, uh, United States is, believes in democracy and, and self determination, where a-,|sv
but that -|%
on the other hand we believe in self preservation and, uh, agree with the, or, not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about, uh, infl-, Soviet influence in, in what's considered to be the United States sphere of the world which is not only, you, we used to see spheres|sv
but now we're in a situation where the United States is, looks like we're it now.|sv
Well the interesting part about it is that, if, realistically it was economic.|sv
I don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal|qy^d
but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua,|sd
uh, and, uh, there were, uh, there's a big, there's a big lake,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, um, from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua,|sd
but the, the United States, uh, had some, -|sd
and I've forgotten what the political influence was|sd
but there were economic ties then.|sd
The issue of, of -|sd
if, if it's in the economic interest of the United States, uh, do we go in and, and prevail|qh
and, and, uh, in other words do we make the world safe for democracy,|qh
Right.|b
but if there's no economic benefit, -|sv
and I think particularly if you're, if you're looking at the, at the, at the peasant, uh, whether he's in Central America, regardless of where he is, is his life, is his life better off under communism or, or uh, or Democratic government.|qh
You look at Salvador where the, -|sd
Well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his, uh, his family.|sv
Yeah,|b
and, and the question is, does the government make a difference.|qh
If they'll mostly leave him alone, uh, -|sv
and I think that's the difficulty they, that, that we have that, uh, it, it reality doesn't make, uh, doesn't make any difference if he has no income.|sv
And apparently even some of our alleged, uh, Central American leaders that, uh, are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things,|sv
so it's, uh, -|%
Yeah,|b
well, yo-, -|%
in looking, bu-, -|%
if you look at the region in, in, uh, -|sd
to their detriment they came from, uh, this, uh, hundreds of years of Spanish control|sd
and the, and the Spaniards have, uh, horrible history of corrupt, uh, government, greedy, uh, rulers who have been, uh, manipulating, manipulating their public for their own, their own good.|sd
I mean, if you go back to the kings and, and the, the conquistadors coming in and, and the hor-, incredibly horrible things they did to the, uh, the native tribes,|sd
I mean they make, uh, they make the things that Custer did look like, uh, like trivial.|sv
And, uh, you get, -|%
It is, it is interesting, that, that, you know we, we look at the exploitation|sd
and, and, and then we accuse some other people of exploiting them|sv
and, and Americans have, uh, have a pretty good reputation of exploiting,|sv
you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and, and took it.|sv
Oh, absolutely|aa
and, you know we set up ... -|sd
and we stole it fair and square,|sv
An, -|%
I mean, Ted, Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation, speak softly and carry a big stick for, uh, for nothing|sv
and, uh, -|%
Right.|b
what's the, what's America's role there|qh
and it, it, uh, -|%
with, with other things going on, it, it seems to have lessened,|sv
but you've still got, uh, Cuba that accepts, exerts some influence.|sv
The only, the only thing I see about Cuba though, is, uh, after Fidel Castro dies, I don't think they'll be a communist power anymore.|ar
I, I can't see communism in that country carrying on past him.|sv
Well, when you take a, a situation where I think in particular in Salvador where there is a significant under class excuse me,|sv
and that, uh, -|%
you know, having a, a lot of difficulty, uh, surviving, uh, the question is would they, you know, would they be better off under communism.|qh
Yeah.|b
and I wouldn't, don't know that I would advocate communism|sv
but, uh, the question is can, uh, can you, can, uh, can a democracy, uh, afford the, -|qh
it's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the U S, is that,|sv
Right.|b
and when you get enough of them, uh, you know communism would feed them all.|sv
Ye-, -|%
well, I, I don't know if maybe communism is the right, the right word for it|arp_nd
but what we would, -|sd
there would have to be some kind of, -|sd
there, there may be a point at which, at which, you've, uh, you might want to consider some kind of socialistic, uh, organization or socialistic set up to, to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy.|sv
Well that, -|%
yeah,|%
if the guys got some incentive, -|sv

yeah,|b
you, -|%
it's not, it's not just a matter of, uh, of having an extra car or having a better car, this is a matter for them of, of feeding themselves their wife and their family|sv

I'm, I'm not sure the Catholic church is, is, is particularly political|sd
but, you know, if ... -|%
Right.|b
Yes,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
um, I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico.|qy
I was a resident, although very young of the sta-, of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state.|sd
Uh, so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.|sd
Uh, I know that all the things that happened, relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive, uh,|sd
and I have a suspicion that, that I believe that a, the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or, or let it go, one or the other.|sv
What is your situation?|qo
Well, I'm, I guess I don't have su-, such close experience with, with, um, an area becoming a state as you do.|sd
Um, my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low sta-, uh, standard of living or at least, um, annual average income.|sv
Um, part of this I suppose is justified in, in that the climate they don't need, perhaps, the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need.|sv
However, in that case, I guess I would favor status quo.|sv
I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it very, very interesting.|sd
I did Peace Corps training there.|sd
Oh that's very interesting.|ba
And so, um, you know, I saw it, also as a young student|sd
and, and it was very foreign in a certain sense, although I had grown up in California|sd
and so the Spanish was no problem.|sd
Um, it was, it was, you know, very lovely|sd
and, and the people seemed very friendly and, and nice.|sd
I have, -|sd
actually, I work with, uh, a girl from Puerto Rico|sd
and, I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors, um.|sd
Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state would that put even more pressures on, on Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U. S. in terms of aid|qy
or, -|%
Well probably more on, in terms of the U. S. Um,|sv
you know, I'm, I'm not quite sure how the U. S. copes with this sort of thing.|sd
I've live abro-, abroad most of my life,|sd
so, I guess I, I've been very cut off.|sd
I lived actually in Lebanon,|sd
so, I was very cut off from the, the press as I, you know, and be, was becoming an adult.|sd
So, I don't know how the U. S. would cope with, uh, a new state that is so very, very poor.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I guess, you know, we'd have a lot of aid, if, if you consider the inner cities of like New York and, and how much aid it needs.|sv
I suppose the whole country, or the whole, um, new state would require such aid.|sv
I guess, um, we're assuming that, that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than, than say Mississippi|qy^d
or, -|%
I think so.|na
Okay,|bk
that's something that, that I guess I have not much of an image of other than, than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a, in a carefree sense, I guess.|sd
Although I'm aware of the political problems and unrest, and, and also difficulties they have. Um, I don't know whether state woul-, statehood would improve their economy.|sv
I don't, I don't know that the ve-, the act of being a state would have any impact on, on them.|sd
Uh, I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now.|sv
But of course if their economy is weak the-, there is not much of a base on which to tax.|sd
I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be.|sd
How do you feel, though, about, -|qh
well I guess it's to their advantage to be a territory,|sv
but, um, I wonder how have, having been in a territory but only as a young student|sd
and my parents were in the military at the time|sd
so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in, in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee.|sd
I, I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se-, feeling of second class citizenry, uh, to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote.|sv
The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite frustrated, I think, at times in their not having a Senate representative.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|%
those, are good points, um, which obviously I had never thought about.|sd
Uh, I don't know, uh, I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would if, if, -|sv
I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I see what you mean,|aa
so that, -|%
Yeah,|b
taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.|sv
Uh, there, -|%
I don't know, I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation.|sd
Um, frequently the laws in a territory are, are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states,|sv
I, -|%
and I'm thinking in terms of education.|sd
But then again each state sets its own|sd
and I don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico.|sd
Um, it's interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to, uh, economy, uh, I had thought of it more in terms of political, uh, realization|sd
and I guess I had automatically made the assumption that, gee, anyone would rather be a state of the U. S. than an independent country|sd
so, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Well, well actually I thin-, -|%
one, one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always assumed it was anyway.|sd
So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
well that's interesting too.|ba
Well it sounds as though you are in favor of, uh, status quo.|qy^d
I, I believe I would probably tend towards that.|na
And I think, uh, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these.|sd
So I'm ul-, I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point,|sv
Well that's interesting.|ba
Right.|b
What about if, if, um, they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood.|qh
I think I would be troubled,|sv
I suspect, I believe that any of our states, -|sd
and I, -|%
constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions abo-, against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something.|sd
Um, I don't think there is any prohibitions.|sd
I would be bothered by that.|sv
I'm, I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's strengths|sv
and that's the, the, the melting pot.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I, I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines,|sd
but I'm troubled by too close a clinging to, to the past|sv
and I'm also realizing that, that a common language, I think, is the ultimate bond of a country.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever.|sd
Uh, that I, I think that would be a negative step to make|sd
and I think that that they would need to reassess that.|sv
Um, I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, uh, in so far that it intr-, it gets in the way of, of, of the melting pot aspect.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual, Spanish based on experience, um, I was in bilingual education in California|sd
and I didn't have any problem with my students|sd
but I noticed my, my brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary school|sd
and he can't speak a word.|sd
Um.|b
And so, obviously it didn't work in California.|sd
Yeah,|b
but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual,|sv
Right.|b
and I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language.|sd
Right.|b
But I'm, I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level.|sv
Oh, I see.|ba
Um, I'm, I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Well I think we have gone to time|sd
and I appreciate your having called.|fc
Okay,|fc
well thank you very much.|fc
Good-bye.|fc
Bye,|fc
bye.|fc
So, Jan, how do they recycle in Texas?|qw
Well, I, -|%
the biggest, uh, way it's going right now, uh, lot, most of the grocery stores --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then they've just got different barrels setting out -|sd
, I shouldn't say barrels, like big John Doors or,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Um, they've got them set outside|sd
and, -|%
Is it,|qy
uh,|b
Yes.|ny
It's all voluntary.|sd
Now, they do have some places where you can take things and get cash|sd
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
You know, they just want to, uh, help recycle. Which is,|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
we, -|%
probably the only thing, sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in|sd
and we let the kids get the money for that.|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
But, uh, -|%
There's,|sd
f-, -|%
Right.|b
Right.|b
Yeah.|aa
That's true,|aa
but, but that's really the, the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know but, -|%
I guess, I, -|%
you see, I guess it depends on your landfill space.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I know, I, -|%
we're in Maryland,|sd
but, my, -|%
I from Pennsylvania *missing copula?|sd
and my parents how, are forced recycling,|sd
Oh,|bh
uh,|b
Yeah.|b
Oh, wow.|ba
Uh, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York are some of the, uh, -|sv
they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, it's really, uh, it's, uh, really hard on them.|sv
Now, up here in Maryland, though, we're j-, just in a voluntary recycling stage right now.|sd
So, uh, so my wife and I, you know, we save our bottles,|sd
and we save our newspapers,|sd
and we save all our plastic, and all of our tin cans.|sd
And just like you say, we go to, uh, a community area where they have it set up|sd
and we dump them off there.|sd
So, it's vol-, -|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
It's still voluntary,|sd
you say it is all voluntary.|sd
Do they, -|qy
Will it be mandatory?|qy
Uh-huh.|b
Is it all, um, -|qy
is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff|qy
or is it all, -|qrr
Mostly just the cans.|sd
Okay.|bk
And I, -|%
Yeah.|b
And that's, -|%
and most of the time, like I said, that's, that's a sort of like fund raiser things that,|sv
Right.|b
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
That's true.|aa
That's, -|%
Cans are the only thing I think you really get money for.|sv
Well, they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers,|ar
Uh-huh.|b
But, you know, I think a lot of people, like I said, are more concerned,|sv
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
I think that's mostly, -|sv
well, you know, we, -|%
even before, -|%
as soon as the community said, you know, We're going to put up bins for recycling, you know, we automatically started,|sd
It was,|sv
Right.|b
you know, and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's, -|%
Well, I tell you, it's kind of funny now at, e-, even at T I, I don't, -|sd
do you work for T I?|qy
No.|nn
Huh-uh.|nn
Okay.|bk
Um, at T I they're doing recycling.|sd
I mean, for a long time they didn't do this,|sd
but now they're, they're recycling cans and paper.|sd
We have separate bins --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
You know, and they, -|%
I mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees|sd
and, you know --|sd
Right.|b
I can't believe that --|sd
Yeah.|b
How much, how well they're doing.|^2
yeah.|%
We do, -|%
I, um, I, I work in a, uh, speech interface lab,|sd
Oh, okay.|b
And we do basically the same thing.|sd
The state of Maryland has lost, asked all the colleges and universities, and some of the large organizations, you know, if they would definitely recycle their office paper.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But, you know, in the giant bins around, -|sd
and it's surprising how much --|sv
Yeah.|b
Right.|b
Yep.|b
You don't notice until,|sv
you know, they don't pick up your recycling until it's full|sd
Right.|b
I know|ba
Reams of paper come,|sv
Well, you think about,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, you know, cost wise and --|sv
Right.|b
I mean, it's just amazing, you know,|sd
Yeah.|b
So, I think,|sv
you know, I guess a lot of the large organizations, probably T I, did they advertise on television how successful they are?|qy
N-, -|nn
I haven't seen,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, but that doesn't mean that they don't.|sv
I don't watch much T V,|sd
Yeah.|b
but, I haven't really seen anything advertise publicly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then, like I said, they do a lot of internal,|sd
Internal.|b^m
Uh-huh.|b
But, I haven't seen anything.|sd
Yeah.|b
But see, I don't see a lot of T I advertisements on T V anyway.|sd
I think they advertise more, um, other places where they're not located.|sv
Right.|aa
Yeah.|aa
That would probably,|aa
You know. So,|sd
Yeah.|b
Because I know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television,|sd
you know, they'll jus-, come up and say, -|sd
you know, they'll show you tho-, to encourage to encourage recycling.|sd
They'll,|sd
Right.|b
And here, those of us that Dumavra Power, which is our power company,|^q
Uh-huh.|b
we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste,|^q
Right|b
and they, -|%
and that, -|%
we do this for the community,|^q
they put those on.|sv
So I, so I think, you know, we're probably reaching a successful stage and, and just with voluntary,|sv
Right.|b
Well, even, I mean, in the kid's schools,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, I know my kids, um, like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say, Oh, look at that. Somebody is not saving the earth, you know.|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
So, I mean, the kids, I mean, they really try to educate all ages, you know,|sv
and it's good to start the kids real young on,|sv
I think so, too.|aa
Yeah.|b
I mean, it's like nobody was concerned about it.|sv
Right.|aa
Yeah.|aa
We weren't,|sv
You know, and it's like, -|sd
Yeah.|aa
That's true.|aa
You know, it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things, saying, Hey, you know,|sd
Huh.|b
you know. And now everybody is doing something about, which is good.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But how come we weren't doing this, say, twenty years ago|qw
Yeah.|b
I, I think really probably what hit peoples, you know, I know that here in the, up in the, uh, uh, the, the New Englands area and also in, in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York, the, just run, all of a sudden we're out of landfill.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, and they're saying, We estimate this landfill be ov-, will be full in two years unless we cut back.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So, I think that, that became, -|sv
that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space,|sv
This is, -|%
So, what, -|%
you know, and n-, no other state, -|%
I'm sure Texas probably still has some landfill space.|sd
They're not going to voluntarily say, Hey, ship your garbage here.|sv
Right|b
Yeah.|aa
That's true.|aa
It's really,|sd
I think,|sv
I mean, this is such a tremendous,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, why, -|%
I can't understand why nobody saw that before.|qh
I mean, even, even not --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I,|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
But, well, -|%
Well, in some ways, I guess, it, it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it, you know. Because,|sv
But, the de-inking process that they have to, they use,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
and also, it w-, it produces a, a waste, a, um, a,|sd
Oh.|b
okay.|b
Is not --|^2
Oh, okay,|b
okay. Oh,|b
Yeah.|%
I,|sd
So,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They,|sd
Right.|b
and glass.|^2
Right.|b
Yeah.|%
Uh-huh.|b
So, i-, -|%
it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before.|sv
Yeah.|aa
That's true.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|%
And even, -|%
I, I noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, I mean, that kind of surprises me|sd
I mean, you know, because once oil gets so, you know, thick and yucky, you'd wonder how they could, you know, clean that up,|sd
Yeah.|b
but they can.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I don't know how cost efficient that would be, I guess,|sd
Yeah.|b
I d-, I don't know either.|h
That's, -|%
I know that though, I, e-, all those petroleum products though are so terrible for your, um, the water table.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, they really pollute quickly|sd
and, you know, one, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Wow.|ba
So, it's one of those things that they really, -|sv
Yeah|b
Yeah.|aa
I know|ba
Yeah,|b
how terrible that is.|qh
So, we'll have to, we'll have to keep our eyes on all that, I guess.|sv
Really.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I know I really, -|%
I don't know,|h
I, I think that, I mean, I think that they really are doing a good thing now|sv
and I hope it keeps, -|sv
well, I'm sure we'll keep up.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I,|aa
You know,|qy
I think it's really catching on.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, I, I think that, -|%
I'm not sure if it, -|%
I don't know,|h
I think it's a good idea to make it mandatory|sv
I do, too.|aa
Um, it, -|%
because like we were asking some people that live in, um, North Dakota, Well, are you saving your, you know, are you recycling.|sd
And they said, Well, we're not forced to do it yet,|sd
so no.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, so, I mean I don't know,|h
I think that if people are forced, if the people are not forced to do it they may not, you,|sv
Yeah.|b
I mean, I don't know,|h
I think a lot of people still will,|sv
You know, I know that it's really funny.|sd
My parents are forced to do it|sd
and they, -|%
Well, I personally don't have any problem with, uh, drug testing employees or potential employees, do you?|qy
Um,|b
I mean, basically?|qy
Basically, no.|nn
Okay.|bk
I don't, -|%
I really can't disagree with it.|sv
I, I, uh, uh, -|%
the policy that T I has, I think is, uh, uh, very fair.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I, -|%
they first had a policy where they, uh, would test new employees|sd
and, then since I've been with them the last four years, uh, there's been in the last year, year and a half, um, they're doing random testing of all employees.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I think that's really the only fair way to do it.|sv
Yes.|aa
I really think it ought to be s-, -|sv
you know, Junkins all the way down.|sv
And it is, -|aa
it, -|%
and fr-, from what I understand it is Jerry Junkins all the way down.|sv
Right,|b
as a matter of fact, I want to think they took the top managers first,|sd
isn't that a fact?|^g
I've been retired from T I about a year,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but the program, you know, was still fairly new.|sd
I guess it had been going on, maybe almost a year,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so I was not, uh, ever called upon to do a drug test.|sd
I certainly wouldn't object to it,|sd
and I think random is probably, you know, the only really fair way to do it.|sv
Yeah.|b
Um, I like it because, um, -|sd
you know, I, I, I grew up in the sixties,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
you know, I know my friends who were you know, druggies and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, I, -|%
absolutely.|aa
and I think it, and I think it's causing us a lot of trouble and,|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And so I'm hoping that, uh, a lot of other companies will, will follow the same path.|sd
I don't think they'll have much choice, do you?|qy
Um, probably not.|ng
Especially if they have anything do with, you know, government contracts, or anything.|sv
As matter of fact, I want to believe that the, uh, defense department more or less mandated that people, you know, who work on defense contracts, you know,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think that's really what maybe prompted T I to do it.|sv
I was in the, uh, Defense Electronic Division when I retired.|sd
I know it was, a, you know, it was a real hot, hot item there.|sv
I think, I want to think maybe they, you know, really got some nudging from, you know, D O D to do this sort of thing.|sv
Yeah,|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
So you kne-, you know the atmosphere, then.|qy^d
Yep.|ny
So, yeah.|b
Very aware of it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Right,|aa
I agree.|aa
I, -|%
I mean, I'd like, I'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or,|sv
That's right.|aa
That's r-, -|aa
absolutely.|aa
Yeah,|aa
I d-, -|%
I just can't disagree with you , with you know the basic premise.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's to m-, -|%
as far as I know, it's, you know, seems to be a fairly accurate program, as far as, uh, you know, the testing goes.|sv
And, uh, -|%
And, I like the idea that they have a, uh, system where they allow you to, uh, be retested if for,|sv
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
And offer you, you know, help if you need help.|^2
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|b
rather than just, uh --|sd
Yeah.|%
That's right.|aa
That's not going to help anybody get over the problem.|sv
No,|aa
ab-, -|aa
I believe it is a, a, a medical problem.|sv
That's right.|aa
Um, of course I also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world, too|sv
Oh, absolutely.|aa
Not to mention alcohol.|sv
Yeah,|b
so I mean, there's a lot of things out there|sd
Yep,|b
yep.|b
I'm just glad that they, uh, decided not to, uh, tax drugs, otherwise they'd be legal,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way,|sv
That's right|aa
That's right|aa
oh, gosh.|ba
Well, it's, it's a real problem,|sv
I'm sure.|sd
I'm sure.|sd
Yeah.|b
I have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I, uh, uh, I moved to a T I facility that, um, had never had, uh, random drug sampling before,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
It was, uh, an industrial company, and, you know, that T I purchased,|sd
and so the people here, a lot of them are real opposed to it.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
Uh, they were really opposed to it,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, you know, there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and that's why they were opposed to it.|sv
That's right.|aa
And, uh, it resulted in, in a few people leaving,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
You know, they had a life-style|sd
and they weren't going to change it.|sv
Yeah,|b
right.|b
And it's, -|%
Yeah,|b
I know a lot of people who, when it first be-, -|sd
or at least began, was in the talking sta-, -|sd
you know, everybody knew it was coming,|sd
it just a matter of time, everybody was screaming, you know, invasion of privacy and all this stuff.|sd
But a lot of people, I think, after they thought about it for awhile, and you know, weighed the pros and cons, decided, you know, it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs, of course.|sv
Yeah.|b
I mean, uh, you should have no objection to it,|sv
it's like, uh, going down to get your license and checking your eyes.|sv
That's right.|aa
I mean, you know, why do I need my eyes checked,|qh
Uh-huh.|b
That's right,|aa
yep,|aa
yep.|aa
You know it's like, why are we doing this?|qh
Well, so you don't kill people on the road.|sd
That's right.|aa
Or yourself|^2
or, -|%
Uh, it's a ba-, -|%
I mean, it's the basic premise with,|sv
Yeah.|b
That's right.|aa
Especially some of the jobs, um, -|sv
luckily I've always been in the engineering sector,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as, uh, you know, hurting someone, I mean,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it,|sv
Yeah.|aa
That's true.|aa
But, uh, in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
assembly people.|^2
That's right.|aa
That's r-, -|aa
absolutely.|aa
So, there's a, there's a lot of sectors where I think that would, would help out,|sv
and I think in the long run, we all benefit.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
oh, absolutely,|aa
yeah.|aa
I mean, if you have, uh, -|%
you know, if you're not working with someone on drugs, well then you're going to have less accidents,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and you have less accidents|sv
and you spend less money on medical.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And you spend less money on medical, then the company's more profitable.|sv
Yeah.|b
The company's more profitable,|sv
Sure|b
right .|b
If they can pay you more, you can buy more,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and then, and it, -|%
and it goes around,|sv
Sure.|b
Trickles, trickles up and down.|bf
Yep,|b
all over.|sv
Sure does.|aa
And, uh, -|%
Yeah,|b
affects a lot of people.|sv
It certainly does|aa
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
and, and, and start it up.|sd
I think they probably will.|sv
You know, if, if they, -|%
I'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer.|sv
I'm not sure every small company could do it.|sd
Well, a lot of companies are, are, coming down in price,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I think that the insurance companies are starting to give, uh, benefits.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, re-, reduction in, in medical costs if, you know, they, -|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|b
yeah,|b
it's got to help them too.|sv
Yeah,|b
so, I think everybody will, will benefit from the program.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
yeah,|aa
I do too,|aa
that's right.|aa
And I think if, if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And of course, you know, the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent, they're going to reduce their own.|sv
No,|ar
no.|ar
But it'll save in some areas,|sv
yeah,|%
right.|b
Yeah,|b
and that'll cover it.|sd
And maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as a, uh, as part of the package.|sv
That's right.|aa
That certainly could happen.|sd
That's a very ver-, very, very competitive business.|sd
Yeah.|b
So it, -|%
I, I think, I think all around it, it's going to help out a lot.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I do too.|aa
Course, -|%
I just really can't disagree with you.|sd
Yeah.|b
Okay,|b
well, it's nice to talk to you.|fc
It was great talking with you.|fc

so, -|%
First how much television watching do you do? -|qw
I do a little bit more than I think usual people do because I am here alone during the day,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I like it just for the noise|sd
That's right,|b
but do you actually watch it,|qy
Um.|b
or is it more of a company?|qrr
Um,|b
it just depends on what it is.|^h
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, I have my favorite things that I do,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
okay.|b
and then some fun thing to do sometime.|sd
Right.|b
Um, what about you?|qo
Well, actually, I work full time|^h
and when I am not working I am running|^h
and I do not watch a lot of television|sd
and I am very selective in what I watch.|sd
Right.|b
If there's something that I absolutely want to watch I will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off.|sd
I probably watch television four hours a week, max.|sd
Well see that's great,|ba
yeah.|%
And, and, uh, -|%
Well, -|%
if, if I do not find something that I really want or really want to watch, well, then I just do not turn it on.|sd
I would rather listen to music.|sd
Right.|b
Part of it is that, uh, I think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis|sv
and I think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in, sometimes they influence us|sv
and we do not know where that influence came from.|sv
Well, I think that, well, part, I think that's partially true, too.|aap_am
Yeah.|b
I think you have to have the will and the, -|sv
and, uh, anyway, I think it, -|%
Uh, right,|aa
right,|aa
right.|aa
you are, you would be susceptible to stuff.|sv
Of course, I, uh, -|%
And it has to be reinforced at another level too.|sv
That's|%
Do you like specials?|qy
Well, last night, for example, I really would have liked to have watched UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.|na
Those are fascinating to me.|sd
Oh.|b
If I have the opportunity, I watch it.|sd
Unfortunately, I was with someone else who was flipping channels.|sd
Oh|b
I hate that.|sd
I do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor.|sd
Oh, right,|b
yeah.|b
In our comedy programs, although, -|sd
nobody can appreciate comedy any more than I can,|sv
but I would prefer to find, a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians.|sv
Well, we have cable also,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and sometimes you can, um, get the H B O specials,|sd
and sometimes those are really,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So, I, I like to watch comedy,|sd
I mean, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
and that's something.|sd
I, I enjoy comedy.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I, I guess I have my old favorites,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Bob Newhart is still on.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I watch him.|sd
I enjoy that,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
And, uh, you know, something on that level, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, I also enjoy, uh, -|sd
I do not know,|h
Sunday mornings, it's Channel Thirteen, -|sd
I watch a lot,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
and I,|sd
That's right.|b
I mean, I think that's so hysterical,|sv
Uh-huh|b
It's just so much fun.|sd
It's just, it's just a lot of fun,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, I do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the, they say,|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
so, yeah,|%
Well -|%
I like to be entertained,|sd
I really do|sd
Yeah.|b
I watch it for entertainment,|sd
but I also watch it for, uh, cultural impact.|sd
I do a lot of channel thirteen, channel three, some of the educational channels,|sd
and I watch for special programs that have special, a special play, a special concert, uh,|sd
I recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars.|sd
Oh, now that was fabulous,|ba
Uh, and it was fabulous.|aa
and that, you know, -|qy
I was just absolutely, -|sd
Yeah.|b
you just held you breath,|sv
Yeah.|b
and, uh, -|%
Yeah.|b
oh, I was just, -|sd
it makes chills all,|sv
I know.|ba
So, -|%
So, -|%
I, I may or may not even look at the T V guide,|sd
but if I have time I may flip through and say hey this looks good if I finish this task I can watch that in an hour.|sd
Uh, if the hour comes and I do not get a chance to watch it, so what.|sd
You know, well, there's certain thin-, -|%
I mean, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
I have got, um, my T V in the kitchen here|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I love to watch cooking shows.|sd
I, I really do.|sd
like she is drinking I do too,|aa
it makes me want to cook,|sd
I know|ba
and then I eat,|sd
and then I get fat,|sd
so, I just let other people watch|sd
I, I, -|%
yeah.|%
then I eat what they cook|sd
And, and there's some, um, -|%
in fact, one of the water color shows, I know, has inspired me to take water color lessons, you know.|sd
Oh, I think that's,|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh, yeah,|b
I took a lot of my,|sd
I took some of my,|sd
Yeah.|b
so that, -|%
it's very successful for some of,|sd
Oh.|b
but I think I really got stung very badly about having influence in your life,|sv
or at least I saw a very bad example of having television influence your life, uh,|sd
my husband had an aunt who was addicted to soaps,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, I want you to know that became the most suspicious, cantankerous, contrary old woman ever walked.|sd
She got you a -|bf
Absolutely,|aa
I do not know who she thought she was,|sd
but she just got to the point where you could might near, you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice,|sd
Yeah.|b
And for her to miss a soap, it was a big withdrawal.|sd
Oh, well, see that's, -|%
And, -|%
But she was probably depressed to begin with.|sv
Well, I do not know.|h
You know what I mean?|qy
Well, she was grumpy to begin with.|sd
Yeah,|b
grumpy to begin with.|b^m
Yeah.|%
There's no doubt about that,|sv
but, uh, but you could clearly see those influences,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I know that one day, uh, my youngsters were watching THE THREE STOOGES,|sd
and I always thought that was just casual slap stick,|sd
I hate that show|sd
but when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench, I decided that was not funny,|sd
Yeah.|b
I, I, -|%
And, I really,|sv
Good.|ba
I think that is, -|sv
the kids watch that|sd
and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid I ever saw.|sd
And I just, I do not like it.|sd
Is not that amazing.|qh
How old are your kids?|qw
like ice against a glass, then drinking Mine are grown,|sd
but I have grandchildren.|sd
Oh, okay,|bk
so that's, -|%
Yeah.|b
and, uh, for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic|sv
I had forgotten about that,|sd
see, it's just my husband and I|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
but, uh, um, I don't know.|h
Well, I was very careful even when my kids were,|sd
Yeah.|b
And when they were young I was, really did, uh, watch what they watched.|sd
I was cau-, -|sd
I sat down with them|sd
and I watched it,|sd
and if I did not like it, I changed the channel for them. You know,|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
I just wou-, -|%
And, and you know we get it at school, too,|sv
anyway, so you might as well not,|sv
Sure.|b
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
Gosh,|ba
they got, they are mouthy enough anyway.|sd
I know, I remember going to sch-, -|sd
my parents were a lot like, too -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
kids have,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, my parents never let me watch anything like that.|sd
I could watch YOGI BEAR, you know,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
what kind of culture was that|qh
Yeah|b
well, -|%
And, I remember going to school the next day|sd
and everybody would be asking, oh, did you see that,|sd
Uh-huh|b
and did you see, -|^q
and I could never participate.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it always made me feel a little bit, you know, a loner|sd
like I, you know, -|qy
Sure,|na
I can,|sd
But, uh, -|%
But see, then my parents, -|sd
Absolutely,|aa
well, I did,|sd
to, uh, -|%
I ran my kids to death|sd
I said, hey, I think that's enough television for awhile,|sd
Really.|b
maybe we need to go outside,|sd
Yeah.|b
and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company.|sd
So I would go out with them,|sd
now see there's the problem, parents do not do that.|sv
They,|sv
That's true.|aa
Or, you go rent a video up at,|^q
Yeah.|b
I said, -|%
and we did other things.|sd
And I think that was, -|sv
Well that's, you know, that's something people do not do,|sv
well, here we are talking on that subject,|sd
but that's, that's an interesting concept|sd
I have got to stick in my , uh, -|sd
Of course,|b
You know work with kids|sd
but, uh,. -|%
And I guess, the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party, if we wanted to do something like that or,|oo_co_cc
Yes,|aa
uh-huh.|b
sure.|b
Right,|b
Are you one who gives dinner parties very often?|qy
No.|nn
No,|nn
nor am I.|sd
I avoid them with all|sd
They are a lot of work,|sv
that is for sure.|sd
Yeah,|aa
they are, -|aa
I mean I do them,|sd
Yes.|b
but they are a lot of work.|sv
Yeah.|b
I usually have them when I, there is a special event in our lives|sd
and I,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I think I am most, uh, happiest with my most,|sd
Yeah.|b
Right,|b
yes.|b
You know, and I have, I make my own pies and pie crust|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I do not need a recipe to follow.|sd
And, uh, -|%
Oh, that's great.|ba
You sound like my mother who has been, -|sd
well I bake pies too,|sd
but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family|sd
and she has the same, the same technique,|sd
I mean, I guess after many years of doing it, you just,|sv
Yeah,|b
you just know from heart.|^2
I had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie|sd
and she said make me one,|sd
and I made her one.|sd
Uh.|b
And when I, when she gave me back the plate, she said "I did not share this with anybody".|sd
And I thought whoa, that was a big pie.|sd
She enjoyed it, huh|qy
Yes|ny
Well, there is a woman in our choir, who is nearly famous for her apple pies,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, we had a, a, an auction one time at the church|sd
excuse me, and, uh, one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars|sd
My word,|ba
she must have a great pie recipe then.|sv
Well, I think I, I have had it once|sd
and it has been a few years ago,|sd
but I do recall that it was quite good,|sd
so, uh, -|%
Wonderful.|ba
Yeah.|b
So, that is her specialty, uh,|sd
I like to bake, uh, also,|sd
I do not bake so much now that my children are grown,|sd
but I do enjoy baking|sd
and I guess I always liked making, uh, cookies and bars and things like that,|sd
that was more my specialty,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And they seem to last longer than pies around here|sd
pies would go practically,|sv
Yeah|b
you, -|%
That's right,|aa
yeah|aa
they are meant for the, that evening's,|sd
Yes.|b
and, you know, it has got to be gone or daddy gets into the, you know, the leftovers.|sd
Right|b
Puts about two more inches on his waistline|sd
and then he is chastising,|sd
And , -|%
Well, it is interesting that, -|sd
yesterday, I had lunch with a friend|sd
and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
For, um, uh, -|%
one of her acquaintances, one of her old friends, I guess, had been in town|sd
and, uh, they invited two other couples over|sd
and so there were seven of them that, uh, -|sd
I said "well, what did you have"|sd
and she said what she had, uh, just Mexican food,|sd
but, you know, she had, uh, uh, guacamole|sd
and, uh, I cannot remember all she had.|sd
But she also had made, uh, flan, which is actually Spanish, I think.|sd
Have you ever made that or had it?|qy
No,|nn
I have not,|sd
huh-uh.|nn
It's, uh, it's, um, -|%
I had, used to work with a gentleman who was from Cuba, who would make it,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
it's just a wonderful dessert.|sd
It's like, uh, an egg custard in a caramelized sugar,|sd
Oh, okay.|b
And it's, it's quite, actually, not very difficult to make,|sd
but it's very, very high in cholesterol, I am sure with all the eggs that are in it.|sd
Sure,|b
yeah.|b
But, uh, she said that she and her husband had, uh, traveled in Spain a couple years ago.|sd
And, and flan is almost, uh, a basic with every meal that you get,|sd
Like apple pie in America,|bf
right.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
Wow,|ba
uh-huh.|b
It's just very customary to get flan.|sd
So if you ever run into that you will sort,|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, I would never have thought of making that as part of a, a Mexican dinner,|sd
but, you know, sopapillas, I guess, would be another kind of a dessert, if you decided to do something like that.|sd
But -|%
Uh-huh.|b
flan is something you can,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but, uh. Well, I would, have been thinking I would like to have a dinner party sometime soon,|sd
but I tell you it, -|%
th-, -|%
I -|%
my -|%
it's one of those things where it does require some real, uh, planning|sv
and,|%
Yes,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
you don't just make the dinner,|sv
you have the house to clean and, you know, the whole business that goes with it.|sv
Well, when I have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the,|sd
Yeah.|b
Probably a good way to do it.|aa
Oh, the house needs cleaning, I guess I had better have a dinner party|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
we are catering a wedding, uh, um, in August|sd
and,|sd
Oh.|b
it at, -|%
it's at her house,|sd
she is not a good housekeeper.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So she has got to hire this crew,|sd
Oh.|b
Good heavens|ba
Yes,|b
and there, you know, -|%
she is, she must have found some jewels,|sd
Uh.|b
Oh, wow.|ba
Yeah,|b
so, -|%
That is such a nice thing,|sd
it's, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
I, you know, -|%
until, -|%
well we have, -|%
my husband and I have been married twenty six years,|sd
and until last year I had never had another person clean my house,|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so, I had a woman come in, uh, once a month,|sd
and you know, it was not just very often,|sd
but for me it was wonderful|sd
Sure,|b
yeah|b
that is nice, you know, to have that,|sd
that's a,|sv
Well, -|%
it is,|aa
and it is buys you time to do other things, like have a dinner party, I guess.|sv
That's right,|aa
yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
So, it is just a real gift of time as far as I am concerned,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but, well, uh, I, -|%
I, I have a pie crust recipe that I, that is unique,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I have heard about that.|sd
Have you?|qy
but I have never tried it.|sd
No,|nn
well I should say I have heard of one that has vinegar in it,|sd
I do not know that it has egg in it.|sd
Egg and sugar.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Do you have it right on the top of you head?|qy
Uh, I, -|%
no,|nn
I think it would be too hazy, because, um, the, -|sd
I, uh, -|%
no.|nn
You do not have it,|sd
yeah.|%
I would , -|%
Well, it, -|%
like the liquid is like,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
and you mix that together|sd
and then you, you know, your, -|%
see it makes, it makes, uh, five pie crusts at once.|sd
Uh, quite large,|ba
yeah.|%
So, that, -|%
it's quite a volume of, -|sd
Right.|b
I think it's four cups of floor,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, like, uh, a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then you, uh, put in your liquid.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, what is it about the, uh, the vinegar that, uh, makes,|qy
It just,|sd
Uh.|b
Interesting.|ba
and, you can really treat it rough|sd
and you are still going to have a flaky pie crust.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
boy, that, that's the real secret.|ba
Like, uh, it's not mine,|sd
it was from the, one of the magazines, probably, twenty years ago|sd
and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it|sd
and,|sd
I thought, wow, quite a statement for them to make.|sd
Oh, th-, -|%
it makes me think of years ago, uh, when I was visiting my mother-in-law in, uh, Michigan,|sd
she lived very near an apple orchard|sd
and we just had, -|%
we could take as many apples as we wanted from it.|sd
Accor-, -|%
you know, according to the owners,|sd
and so I decided to bake about four pies ahead, you know,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
well, talk about working with big amounts of pie crust, and having it be tough.|sd
Those were the toughest apple crust, or apple, uh, pie crust,|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
Wow.|b
It was terrible.|sd
I, I could have used that recipe,|sd
it sounds like. -|%
Well, I am from Michigan.|sd
Where about?|qw
Detroit,|sd
uh-huh.|b
Well, we lived in Plymouth for four years, uh,|sd
Oh yeah,|b
that's real close.|sd
Yeah.|b
In fact, I, we were there from, uh, seventy three to seventy seven|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, my husband is from the upper peninsula,|sd
so he was born and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That is where my mother-in-law still lives,|sd
so, uh. Are you originally from Michigan|qy
or, -|%
Oh, yes.|ny
Uh-huh.|b
Born in Detroit.|sd
I will be darn.|ba
Golfer?|qy
Well, yes,|ny
I am as a matter of fact.|sd
Well, -|%
Not a good one,|sd
but I am a golfer.|sd
Well, that's about the way I am.|aa
I don't consider myself a good one,|sd
but I do enjoy it.|sd
I, uh, haven't been out all year.|sd
I didn't get out this year,|sd
but, uh, I enjoy both watching it and playing it.|sd
I usually play a couple of times a month.|sd
Sometimes more,|sd
but lately it's been just about that.|sd
But, I do enjoy, -|sd
I think the, one of the things I enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses.|sv
Yes,|aa
and, the, the peacefulness.|^2
Uh-huh.|aa
You can get out there,|sd
And the little critters that are around.|^2
Yeah,|b
that's really neat.|sd
You can just get out there and lose yourself in it and forget everything else in the world except what you're seeing out there.|sv
That's right|aa
and it's such a personal challenge.|^2
Uh-huh,|aa
yeah,|aa
it really is.|aa
More than competitiveness against someone else.|sv
It's, it's a competitiveness against yourself.|sv
And, you know, it's so frustrating,|sd
I keep wondering sometimes why do I do this because it's so frustrating.|qh
You think you do pretty good one day|sd
and you're doing a whole lot better, you know,|sd
and then all of a sudden you go back out|sd
and it's just terrible.|sd
Well, you'll, -|%
You can't do anything,|sd
Or you'll hear thirty and think, boy --|sd
I've had a par and a birdie,|sd
and then you quadruple bogey|sd
And you think, my goodness, why did I think I was doing better|qh
Being down there, do you, uh, get to see, like the colonial or any of those?|qy
I don't, -|%
I guess I could.|^h
I've never been to a golf, to a major golf tournament.|ng
Oh.|b
I, uh, watch them on T V a lot.|sd
You really should go at least once.|ad
You know, we've --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, a-, and in Tulsa|sd
and I've been to both of them|sd
and it's it is so much fun to --|sd
Really?|bh
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, it's, it's like a bullet going by.|sv
I'll bet, um.|ba
And, you know, to, to see their concentration and yet to see them, how friendly they are when they're, walk by you, you know, and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I've only been playing like about three years now.|sd
My husband's played for twenty-five.|sd
But, I just took it up about three years ago|sd
and, uh, we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments.|sd
We belong to a country club a little ways outside of Dallas,|sd
Both, -|%
Yes.|b
and, you know, it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses.|sv
Yes,|aa
it is.|aa
You can meet some really neat people.|sv
The scrambles are fun.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
they really are.|aa
I just love them.|sd
I belong to the country club there in El Reno when I lived there|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
You really, on those, you really go out for fun.|sv
That's right.|aa
And, you know, you won't, -|sd
you know you're stroke is just one of one or two or three --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That's right.|aa
And you just do your own thing and be relaxed and enjoy it|sv
That's right.|aa
I used to, when I worked at Kerr McGee, I used to play in their tournaments.|sd
Really?|bh
And, uh, now that was very competitive.|sd
Really?|bh
And, I enjoyed it tremendously,|sd
but, uh, I, I'm more, I think I get more enjoyment just couple friends going out.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And if, if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green, so be it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, we just think, well, the next time has got to be better|sd
Yeah,|b
I have never played in any tournament except just a scramble.|sd
They have a lot of them there at the club, you know,|sd
they have A B C D type tournaments|sd
and then they, they have the club championships and everything with the women's slots as well,|sd
but, I don't know,|h
I've just never really gotten into that.|sd
Now, my husband and all the men, I mean, they love the real competitiveness of playing for money, you know.|sd
Oh, yes,|b
every hole.|bf
Uh-huh.|b
But I, I'm not good enough for that|sd
Does your club have a good woman's association?|qy
Yes,|ny
they do.|sd
I don't do much with it since, uh, most of theirs, -|sd
they have a traveling league,|sd
and, uh, most of their meetings and all are during the week|sd
and I don't, don't get to play except on the weekend.|sd
I work during the week all the time.|sd
It's hard to be a weekend golfer and improve your game.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Someday when I, I get where I live closer to the club and partially retired, maybe I'll, uh, be able to play a little more|sd
but, -|%
It, uh, it's, it's a, it's a good game.|sd
I, uh, I wish I had more time to play|sd
and I felt, you know, had more energy to play it, too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
My children are all grown up.|sd
Oh.|b
Okay,|b
well, now see, I've got two children|sd
and, uh, they're, -|%
one is o-, uh, just turned to be a teenager|sd
and the other one is on his way,|sd
so. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
I, uh, I'm a single parent,|sd
so I think it makes it more difficult for me to, uh, you know, find time with my, my children since I --|sd
I'll bet.|ba
and then, of course, take care of the house a-, and all this good kind of stuff.|sd
Uh, so it's a real, uh, it's a real problem for me.|sd
I'll bet it is.|ba
Yeah.|b
What is the favorite thing you do with your children?|qw
Uh, the, the thing that we like to do the most is to watch T V together.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, the kids like to play Nintendo,|sd
but I'm no good at it,|sd
so I don't like to play.|sd
You just watch them play, huh?|qy
That's right,|na
that's right.|na
I, I tried it once or twice,|sd
but I didn't feel like I was very good at it either.|sd
Me either.|aa
My grandson got me to one day,|sd
but, -|%
Yeah,|b
they talk about these different levels and stuff|sd
and I've never got off of level one|sd
Different worlds --|sd
Yes.|ny
-- and how do you get to another world, you know?|qh
And I, I don't even know what they're talking about.|sd
I, I know,|aa
I agree with you,|aa
the other thing I think we like to go to the movies, too.|sd
Do you?|qy
That's, -|%
yeah,|%
that's a, that's a neat thing.|sd
So I guess we're all in, uh, you know, movie, uh, fanatics or whatever around here.|sd
Yeah.|b
So we like to do those kind of things.|sd
I know when our kids were growing up, our, we were big into water sports.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We had a boat|sd
and they all skied|sd
and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing|sd
and they always took other friends with them|sd
and we had a lot of fun doing that,|sd
but --|sd
Oh, how neat.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
-- so we didn't do too much sports wise.|sd
Oh.|b
I find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
-- but, -|%
Oh, yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
see, I have a son|sd
and, uh, you know, it's football in the fall and, and baseball in the spring|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, I'm constantly going back and forth.|sd
I'll bet you really are.|ba
Yeah.|b
And my daughter has, uh, tennis,|sd
so it's between tennis and, and bowling.|sd
My, -|%
I bowl|sd
so, you know, we're pretty active as a sports, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Well, when mine were real little, they all played soccer|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and then they got more interested in other things,|sd
Boys|^2
I'm not sure that they would admit it at that age, that it was boys,|sd
but I think that's probably what it was.|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
I, I know that, uh, my daughter, uh, even though she goes out with the, the sports and everything, uh, yeah she likes to watch the football for, uh, the kids|sd
I'm sorry.|fa
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, that was a cat that hit the telephone.|sd
Get away, cat,|t3
gosh to|t3
I guess it's why they wanted to do it on this type of telephone because there's all kind of activity that goes on.|sv
But, uh, yeah,|b
my, uh, my kids are, they're starting to grow up, you know.|sd
It's not going to be too many more years before I, uh, uh, you know, they'll be gone|sd
and, and, uh, there won't be as many activities.|sd
Do you, uh, -|qy
But they, -|%
but you enjoy them,|sd
I think, the older mine get, the more I enjoy them.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I, I agree with you.|aa
I, I do.|aa
I'm so glad they're out of the, that young, real young --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and the babies, -|sd
And, I mean, I didn't, -|%
it wasn't that I didn't like them --|sd
Right.|b
but the older they got, I enjoyed them as teenagers.|sd
Yes,|b
yes.|b
And now that they're each, -|sd
of course three girls, they're each becoming the, they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
How, -|%
what kind of mothers they are, -|sd
what kind of --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
that's so true.|sd
How they do things|sd
and, -|%
Well, do you, do the, do your daughters live close where you can go out?|qy
Two of them live real close to me.|na
Oh, good.|ba
So we, we spend a lot, -|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
yeah.|b
and we play with the kids, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, -|%
Yeah.|b
Where d-, oh, -|%
we go camp out,|sd
they camp out --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we spend weekends at the, in the country with them --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but --|sd
That's true.|b
It's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids.|sv
Oh, yes,|aa
oh, yes.|aa
Boy, I know, especially when they grow up like that,|sd
so I'm trying to, these last five or six years, I'm trying to make them really special and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They'll always remember it, too.|sv
Yes,|aa
yes,|aa
absolutely.|aa
I, I think so, too.|sv
I hear mine saying, well, I remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so.|sd
I need to take my boys to do this or that, you know.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
There we go.|sd
I know, I know they can't wait|sd
Yeah,|b
they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun.|sv
That's right,|aa
that's right.|aa
But, -|%
Yeah,|b
so well, I still got a few more years,|sd
so I'm, uh, I'm hanging onto those and doing as much activity as I can with them.|sd
Do you work?|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh,|ny
I sure do.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I work full time,|sd
so, uh, it, it, -|%
that cuts into our free time right there.|sv
It really does.|aa
The time you have with them has to be quality time then.|sv
That's right,|aa
that's right|aa
and, uh, vacations are very special for us, and activities.|sd
I imagine that they have, uh, some, a lot of homework, too.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
You know, this being a school night and stuff,|sd
so, uh, it's, it's in the same old y-, you know, routine of, uh, you know, doing homework and, you know, trying to talk between all of that and, and, uh, the other activities that we all have.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Well, there's just so many things to do with them nowadays, though,|sv
and especially if they're active kids.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Like you say you bowl.|qy^d
Do you know -|%
I don't know what to think.|h
I, I, uh, -|%
the person I am I want to believe that it's an honest effort.|sv
I want to believe that, that they really are trying to change. That, that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society|sv
and I, I want to believe it's all okay.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But then there's that side of me that says, yeah,|sv
Right.|b
so, so it's like there is a struggle within me going do, do I be open-minded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality.|sd
You know I,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I'll do that.|oo_co_cc
Or do I keep on going, well, we'll wait and see|qh
Well, I think there's a, a struggle within the Soviet Union.|sv
Um, I think the people are, are just fed up,|sv
and I think it's showing|sv
and all the republic is trying to gain their independence,|sv
and I think, uh, that's making Gorbachev and others realize that, hey, maybe this Communist thing isn't working.|sv
Yeah,|b
that's it's not just a mere-, or, uh, western society telling you i-, it's, it doesn't work.|sv
Right.|b
You know, they've always said, you know, the, the Soviet people were united,|sd
we believe this,|^q
and maybe they are seeing that, no, no, hey, we don't believe this, you know.|sv
That's right.|b
I think, -|%
I guess I keep that one part of me that's like, -|sv
well, I don't know I want to trust them|sv
and I, -|%
it's like I can't,|sv
and maybe it's because, you know, we've had our own propaganda over the years,|sv
I don't know.|h
Well, that, that could be.|aa
You know what I, -|%
we always, we think of the K G B and we think such bad things, you know.|sv
But I wouldn't doubt if the Soviet people think C I A and they think such bad things, you know.|sv
And they probably do the same things.|sv
Exac-, exactly.|aa
They do.|sv
You think the C I A doesn't spy?|qh
I'm sure they do.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
they do, you know.|sv
Now the difference is we don't, I, I don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe.|sv
You know, I think to that extent we don't go as far|sv
but I'm sure they lie. You know?|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
Oh, absolutely.|aa
So, -|%
That's part of that propaganda thing,|sv
and I think if we can get away from that, or if we can keep that out of our minds, oh, -|sv
excuse me, I've got a cold today.|fa
That's all right.|bd
I hope you get better|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Thank you.|ft
Um, I think if we can get that propaganda thing because I'm sure both countries are seeing, seeing it, you know, thinking K G B and C I A and all that|sv
but, uh --|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
That's true.|aa
And I'm not against them being concerned|ar
but I feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and, and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own.|sv
Right.|b
You know, I mean, you know, any, any country that wants to be democratic I'm all for helping them, you know, because I, I understand that, you know, you are looking at the United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government.|sv
Right.|b
But at the same time I, I agree.|sv
I don't think we can do it and, and just, you know, turn our backs or, or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here.|sv
That's right.|aa
You know, we've got, uh, we've got quite a few domestic problems that, uh, that I feel we ought to be concentrating more on.|sv
I think the problem is, you know, -|sv
on the international scope maybe the president feels that, uh, you know, for long-term relations with all these countries it's important|sv
and well, we'll, we'll always have the United States.|sv
And, you know, we need to solve these international problems|sv
but, um, I think I heard in the news about last week sometime that, uh, the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on dem-, on a domestic issue because the American public is kind of getting fed up with it.|sv
Yeah,|b
we, we, we believe in what he's doing abroad|sv
but, but like you said there's issues here too.|sd
Right.|b
And but I, I am encouraged by what is happening in the Soviet Union.|sd
I'm encouraged by what's happened in, you know, the, the iron curtain countries, you know,|sd
Right.|b
and, and I think it's moved in the right direction.|sv
I, I think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight.|sv
Yep.|b
You know, it's not going to. -|sv
No.|aa
It didn't happen here overnight,|sv
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
And I, I think sometimes we forget that.|sv
But I, I, I, I have to say, yes, I'm, you know, I'm encouraged by the way it's going. Uh,|sd
uh,|b
What kind of books do you like best?|qw
Well, I alternate between Danielle Steele is one of my very favorites|sd
and, uh, then I try to go into one of the self improvement books.|sd
Uh, we, we take books every once in a while in our Sunday school class and go through them.|sd
Uh, I love Scott Peck and his ROAD LESS TRAVELED.|sd
Huh, yeah,|b
I've heard of that one.|sd
I --|sd
Oh, it is --|sd
I, I thoroughly enjoyed that.|sd
What do you read?|qw
Well, uh, I'm a Tom Clancy fan.|sd
Okay.|bk
And I read, -|sd
I just finished a book on Novelle Netware, uh,|sd
that's computer stuff.|sd
I do a lot --|sd
Oh, yes.|b
and, uh, I'm just finishing another one up on, uh, statistical sampling,|sd
so, I do more work kind of related reading than, uh, just for enjoyment.|sd
I, I try to keep a book going all the time.|sd
Uh, I try to read when I first wake up in the morning and then before I go to sleep.|sd
So I probably get, oh, thirty to fifty pages a day read.|sd
Well, that's pretty good.|ba
And I just, you know, -|%
I don't feel like, -|%
in fact this morning, I was almost late for work because I'm almost at the end of this book|sd
and I didn't want to put it down|sd
Oh, I've had them like that before, too.|sd
But I like, I like mysteries.|sd
Mysteries.|b^m
Any particular writer?|qy
Uh, yes,|ny
I like, uh, uh, oh, -|sd
I'm drawing a blank.|sd
Uh, he wrote the, uh, BOURNE ULTIMATUM.|sd
Ludwig,|^2
Lud-, -|%
Ludwig, yes.|aa
Yes.|aa
And, uh, I like Jeffrey Archer.|sd
He is an English author who writes some mystery.|sd
Uh, well, I guess they're, they're a type of mystery.|sd
They're usually some p-, -|%
he's a ex-lawyer|sd
so, or, he, he's a lawyer who no longer practices,|sd
but --|sd
So, you kind of learn something as well as en-, enjoy yourself.|sd
Right,|b
and then, uh, the new author that came out with, uh, oh, the one that, uh, Harrison Ford starred in.|sd
RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK stuff.|^2
No,|ar
no,|ar
it was --|sd
Oh.|b
it's late,|sd
I'm tired,|sd
so I'm not --|sd
What,|qw
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, it's nine thirty here.|sd
Oh, it's, uh, it was his first book.|sd
It came, it was on the top of the list, uh,|sd
he was a D A.|sd
Uh, PRESUMED INNOCENT?|qy
Yes.|ny
Oh, I haven't seen the movie, uh, or n-, read the book|sd
Okay,|b
and then he's, he came out with the second one.|sd
Uh, a sequel to it.|sd
And both of those I've enjoyed real well.|sd
But I, I like that.|sd
I love Danielle Steele|sd
and, and, you know, if I want to get a fantasy and --|sd
Is she --|qy
No,|nn
no,|nn
she isn't at all.|sd
Just feel good.|^2
Her books, uh, -|%
you always cry.|sv
Oh, really?|bh
I mean, it's, it's always good for good tears.|sd
Uh, one book that she wrote that's good for both men and women is FINE THINGS,|sd
M-, my mother-in-law's a real fan of hers.|sd
it's, it's always going to make you have a good cry|sd
and you know it's going it turn out good|sd
and you're going to be happy in the end|sd
Oh, well, that's nice.|ba
And I said, you know, -|%
I don't want anything too real anymore.|sd
I have enough of that in my own life.|sd
I want, I want happy, fantasy|sd
like. -|%
Yeah.|b
Uh, you mentioned Sunday school Ladonna.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, do you, -|qy
are you a BIBLE fan, too?|qy
Uh, I, I do my share of it.|na
I, I certainly can't say that I understand a lot of it.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
but, uh, that's always a challenge.|sv
So do you do, -|qy
my wife talks with other people, -|sd
Okay. Well, what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody?|qw
I think they should.|sv
I know I had a job until, let's see, a year ago this past December.|sd
I was working for P I E|sd
and they closed,|sd
and naturally while I was working for them I had health insurance,|sd
but, um, for me to try to get it now, it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at, at P I E.|sd
Good grief.|ba
That's just almost unaffordable, isn't it?|qy
Right,|na
it really is,|sd
and I think, you know, I think, uh, -|%
God, the government should come up with some kind of a health plan, or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high.|sv
Well, I wonder if they couldn't just provide, uh, interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that.|sd
That might be a step in the right direction.|sv
I don't know.|h
Well, the thing is, you know, jobs are so hard to find --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
anyhow in the valley where I live at now, they don't want to pay anything for health insurance at all.|sd
No benefits, you know. Um.|sd
You mean the, uh, the employers?|br
Yes.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, you get a job now, and the wages are really low|sd
and, uh. -|%
Because everybody's competing for jobs.|^2
Yeah,|aa
and they don't want, uh,|sv
so you just, you know, pray to God that you don't get sick.|sv
Well, I used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do.|sv
I, I have to think about it some more now, because my doctor is, uh, actually he's Canadian --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, he told me that there're a lot of, uh, lot of counts against the Canadian system, which is basically the one people are talking about for here.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't understand the arguments, exactly.|sd
He says it restricts your choice of doctors, and, and so forth.|sd
I'm not quite sure I understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does.|sd
No,|aa
I don't understand --|sd
I mean --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- actually I have my own business,|sd
and --|%
Uh-huh.|b
our health insurance is through my wife's employer,|sd
and, uh, and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to, and where we can buy our medicine,|sd
and, uh, it changes every year|sd
Yeah.|b
It's always so confusing.|sd
So. -|%
Well, I know the plan that I had with P I E, I could go to any doctor|sd
and I could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled, you know,|sd
then I just sent cards in --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine,|sd
and --|sd
Well, yeah.|b
Of course, the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the, uh, the limits --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but of course that is restricted choice,|sv
so --|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
I think it has to do with the, the, the, uh, attempt to limit cost, doesn't it --|sv
Um.|b
-- and everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way,|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true,|aa
that's true there.|aa
Well. -|%
You, you have to recognize that if you're going to have the very best health care possible and, uh, available on demand whenever and wherever you want it, then it's going to be expensive.|sv
Yeah,|aa
right.|aa
And if you want to pay less, then you're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that, uh, lavish.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh. -|%
But there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything, you know, -|sv
that, -|%
people that's on unemployment.|sv
Yeah,|b
what happened to Reagan's safety net, anyway?|qh
I don't -|%
Did he take that back to California with him?|qh
Using it for a trampoline now?|qy
Yeah,|ny
probably so.|sd
I don't know,|h
but it is, it does seem to be a big problem, you know.|sv
I don't know what they're going to come up with,|sd
but, um, I sure wish they would come up with, with something,|sv
and, uh, like I say, -|%
and, and I'm at the age, too, where the, -|sd
I'll be fifty-seven in June,|sd
and the people don't want to hire people this age any more.|sd
And I worked for my previous company for twenty-six years, you know,|sd
so, it's kind of hard, you know,|sd
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
they'll be needing you in a couple of years, because they're running out of kids down that, the other end.|sv
And. -|%
Yeah,|b
they'll be calling at my door, huh.|sv
But anyhow. -|%
Well, if they're smart.|sv
Yeah,|b
now I, I do think the government, though, is going to have to do something, uh, with this problem, because, it, you know, even to go to a little doctor out here, just to ask him anything, costs you forty bucks --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And then he, -|%
then that's not counting what medicine you're going to buy and everything else, you know.|sv
And he might tell you, well, you know, now you're going to have to come back in a week,|sv
and --|sv
Right.|b
Okay, Bill, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you're working with now, -|sd
who do you work with at this time?|qw
Well, I own the company.|sd
You own the company.|b^m
All right.|ba
I'm the president and C E O of the company.|sd
My goodness.|ba
So, uh, I guess, uh, I determine what the benefits are|sv
Yeah,|aa
I guess you do.|aa
But, uh, so what are you asking me,|qw
what, what benefits I think are most important?|qw
Well, what, what do you think of the, -|qw
let's put it this way,|^h
what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you, other than, other than their present salary?|qw
Um, I'd say in today's economy, besides basic benefits, uh, such as, um, health insurance and life insurance and the, some type of retirement plan --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
A profit sharing plan,|b^m
that's interesting,|sd
uh-huh.|b
They like to participate in the profits of the company like they're, you know, -|sv
because they feel like, well, we're contributing to it,|sv
so we'd like to participate in it,|sd
and so that means I make a little bit less,|sd
but the thing is that really you make a little more, because everybody has a interest in, in it working.|sd
Yes,|b
because they they have a specific reason to do so, because they themselves benefit from doing a better job.|bf
Right.|b
I think most people, uh, don't want money, um,|sv
it's been my experience, most people want, uh, to feel like they're participating in something that, uh, that is not a drudgery, you know, that they --|sv
Uh-huh,|b
And it's a contribution.|^2
Right.|aa
Well, Bill, uh, that idea fits me exactly.|sd
I just retired from, uh, the university here,|sd
and that's been the goal in my life, was to contribute and, to the work that I was doing in my research,|sd
and that's what made me happy,|sd
and, uh, that's the type of goal I think most people ought to look for,|sv
and I'm sure a lot of them don't.|sv
You can't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth.|sv
Yeah,|b
well, uh, our people get a lot of satisfaction.|sv
Um, we're a financial planning firm.|sd
You're a financial planning firm?|b^m
Yes.|aa
How many, uh.|qw
You said you retired,|qy^d
I just happen to have a person that I happened to do some planning for this morning,|sd
but --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
well. -|%
-- and, uh, it's real important, uh, that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that, where they were, that, uh, uh, that it take care of them.|sv
They don't, -|%
none of them really want to be rich,|sv
but they like to have enough to be comfortable.|sv
Well, what, what changes would you, have you considered, uh, in doing it, to, to your company, that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better?|qw
Well, um, we, considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a, a salary is, uh, is tie, um, uh, a percentage, um of business that, uh, that a person would participate and bring into the company.|sd
Uh, pay them, uh, based on the percentage of business they bring, instead of based on their salary.|sd
And the re-, -|%
When you say bring in, do you mean that they negotiated with people to, to come in and, uh, ask for your support?|qy
No,|nn
not necessarily.|sd
Um, it can be in-house people who help you handle X amount of dollars.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
Uh-huh.|b
Even though they didn't bring it in, they help it once it's there.|sv
Right|b
well --|sd
Yeah.|b
and then we have financial planners,|sd
and, uh, then we have, uh, staff secretaries and administrative assistants,|sd
and these secretaries and administrative assistants, um, you know, if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company, they, they can get very dissatisfied very quickly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, so, uh, we're thinking about paying them, instead of a percentage on salary, paying them a percentage on the business they handle.|sd
So administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business.|sv
And, uh, -|%
Yes,|b
but it, it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job,|sv
but it might be whether the locality there, those people want that kind of support.|sv
Well, and, and, but to, -|%
see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to, or that they usually have several people they report to that, you know, that they work --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
See, we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it.|sv
I don't think anyb-, any -- -|sv
Yeah.|b
-- I think most people want to be, lack of better term-, terminology, they want to be self-employed,|sv
but they don't want to take the risk.|sv
In other words, they like to control their own future,|sv
but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please --|sv
That's true.|aa
which, -|%
that's what we have.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I guess its recording.|sd
Um, what kind of hobbies do you have?|qw
Do you sing or knit or anything?|qy
Well, I, um, I do cross-stitch|sd
and I enjoy reading and playing softball.|sd
Okay.|bk
I, uh, I started knitting awhile ago,|sd
I knitted -|%
I didn't know, even know what the stitch is called.|sd
I just had this, uh, uh, piece of yarn|sd
and I wanted to start something|sd
so I remembered something I learned I think when I was five years old|sd
So I kept doing that,|sd
and now I have a little blanket|sd
but that's all I've done.|sd
Oh, really.|b
Uh.|b
Well, I know that I learned how to knit one time and, um, made a few things|sd
but I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how|sd
Do you make sweaters and things or just blankets?|qy
Well, if I remember I think we made some, like Christmas stockings,|sd
you could make the, like the granny squares or whatever,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
I see.|ba
Nothing as big as a blanket.|sd
Huh.|b
I know that my husband's grandmother does a lot of that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff|sd
but, -|%
I probably won't make anything beyond this blanket|sd
I don't know why.|h
It's just too time consuming.|sv
Yeah,|b
do you have any other hobbies?|qy
Um, I like to sing.|sd
I've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that.|sd
Oh, well that's good.|ba
Um, right now my actual job is a news reporter.|sd
But, uh, if I could do anything I wanted to do, it would be to sing professionally.|sd
But um, -|%
So are you on the T V then?|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
I'm in, uh, -|%
I work for channel six in Waco.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
And so I do little news reports and things.|sd
It's not as exciting as it|sd
But, um, -|%
So you don't have too much time for hobbies?|qy
No,|nn
not much,|sd
um, my day is usually pretty full.|sd
Yeah.|b
My schedule is like from nine to five thirty,|sd
but I could be at work from anytime, you know, from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever,|sd
so it's hard to make plans much less, you know, have a hobby.|sd
Yeah|b
so. What do you do?|qw
Um.|b
Normally.|sd
I'm a housewife.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
So, unless the kids are asleep I don't get, usually get much done either|sd
Uh-huh|b
But I've made a, um, few things, cross-stitch things.|sd
I really enjoy doing that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And um, I made, uh, like stockings for both my children and a Christmas tree shirt and that,|sd
Oh.|b
and it just takes a long time to get it done|sd
but, you know, once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good, to,|sd
Right.|b
I show-, I showed mine to my boyfriend|sd
and he was like, you didn't make that.|sd
Really?|bh
Oh, yeah,|ny
it looks, uh, halfway decent|sd
actually, first thing I did|sd
I guess you can make baby blankets that wouldn't take as long|sd
How many children do you have?|qw
Two.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
I hear them in the background there .|sd
Yeah|b
All right,|b
that's a hobby in itself.|sv
Not quite|ar
A job in itself.|sv
It's a fulltime job,|aa
yeah.|%
Right now I was just sitting here watching T V,|sd
I was getting ready to fall asleep.|sd
So, um, have you sang at any weddings yet?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I sang at one last summer.|sd
Um, it was my first wedding.|sd
I've done, um, little commercials and background singing|sd
and, um, I sang all through college and things like that|sd
but I really haven't done anything really, professional per se.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But I did one wedding last year|sd
and, uh, I just now got some cards together, kind of, uh, business cards that say,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and what does it say, a song makes beautiful wedding or something,|sd
and I've been passing them out to different wedding shops,|sd
I mean when someone comes in,|sd
Oh, that's a good place,|sv
yeah.|%
Uh-huh.|b
This one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because I have a demo tape, you know, if any one wants to listen.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, she wanted me to bring it in,|sd
she's going to play it on Saturday|sd
so that would be great,|sd
Yeah|b
but,|sd
Well, that's good.|ba
but I only just put them out this week|sd
Yeah.|b
and it's the wedding season, I guess.|sv
Oh, that's true.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
Make your hobby into a business, that would be pretty good, huh?|qy
Yeah,|ny
that would be great.|sd
Then I could be getting paid for something I love to do.|sd
Yeah|b
Not that I don't like reporting,|sd
but, I'd love it.|sd
Did you have training in singing when you were,|qy
or, -|%
No,|nn
I've never, I've never had, uh, formal training.|sd
I've just been singing every chance I get.|sd
I try, you know,|sd
Choirs and that kind of stuff?|qy
and, yeah,|%
choirs|b^m
and, um, when I was at U T, I was in a group called Ensemble One oh Nine, just twelve singers|na
and we did, uh, little conventions and, um, uh, like dinner parties and things like that.|sd
Huh.|b
Sing pop music.|sd
Well, that's nice.|ba
So, that's what got me really, really interested in it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So I'm trying to be sensible, sensible, too, at the same time.|sd
Yeah,|b
not just give up your job and jump right into it|^2
Yeah,|aa
exactly.|aa
My parents would have a fit probably.|sd
But, uh, I think, -|%
I either have a call or, -|sd
yeah,|%
I do have a call,|sd
hold on one second.|ad
Uh-huh|aa
Hello.|fp
Yes.|ny
Yes,|ny
okay|b
that's my mother on the other line,|sd
I need to go,|sd
Oh.|b
but, um, I think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes|sv
are we suppose to hear a beep or anything?|qy
I don't know,|h
I've only done this one other time|sd
and I thought that the man told me five minutes.|sd
Oh, okay,|bk
my mother said ten minutes|sd
so, I don't know.|h
Oh, okay.|b
But, uh, okay|b^m
well, it was nice talking to you|fc
and,|fc
It was nice talking to you, too,|fc
good luck with your singing.|fc
Okay,|fc
bye.|fc
Thanks,|fc
bye.|fc
Well thanks for being home, uh, on the weekend,|ft
I, uh, I'm actually working at night|sd
and, uh, there very few people that are on the list for calls, uh, on the weekends nights.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|b
well sometimes I'm home|sd
and sometimes I'm not,|sd
but if I am it's always fun to talk.|sd
Are, are you part of the school system out there?|qy
I am, as a matter of fact.|na
I'm at, uh, North Carolina State.|sd
Uh, the reason I said that because I've had about, uh, three calls and my daughter had one, too, from different students out of North Carolina.|sd
I guess they pass the names amongst your computer students, or whatever.|sv
Yeah,|b
I think I was the one who did that actually.|sv
Oh is that ri-, -|bh
great,|ba
great.|ba
Yeah,|b
I had a, uh, -|%
I teach a course in Voice I O Systems.|sd
Oh, is that right?|bh
That's wonderful.|ba
So, I know, uh, you know, I know about this project,|sd
so I got my students to sign up|sd
and, uh, apparently a number of them have been participating.|sv
Oh, yeah,|b
I talked to one,|sd
we're not on the subject. Of course,|sd
I talked to one,|sd
I think he had a whole bunch of calls.|sv
He had a roommate that had calls and everything.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
He had way more, twice as many calls as, as I've made, uh,|sd
and I, I'm, -|%
of course, we at T I just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will, uh, sell like gang books, bu-, busters, really.|sv
Yeah.|b
Okay,|b
you first on the subject,|ad
wha-, what do you think, about Latin America?|qw
Uh, let's see,|^h
the subject is, Latin America.|sd
Latin America,|b^m
yeah.|%
I don't know whether I have any real profound thoughts about that,|h
I actually wa-, was planning a trip to Latin America|sd
and I got warned off by some people.|sd
They say Peru can't be traveled to|sd
and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth.|sv
Oh, really.|b
T I had a place,|sd
I'm not too sure,|h
I don't think they do anymore,|sd
down, -|%
I think it was Campinas,|sv
I'm not sure|h
and, uh, I guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry, or whatever.|sd
And they had quite a few, uh, locations,|sd
not quite a few, several, in Latin America.|sd
I think the one in New Mexico is closed|sd
and I think the one in, in Brazil is closed,|sd
but I, I don't know why that is a problem down there|sd
and I guess the crime rate is terrible up here too|sv
and, uh, an -|%
some people say go to New York,|sd
but I don't, I don't have an answer to the crime rate.|sd
It's sad.|sv
That is a sad situation.|sv
I, I'd like to go down to Mexico, you know,|sd
and I keep hearing that, you know, the government and, and the crime rates pretty high too,|sd
that, that is sad.|sv
Yeah.|b
but, uh. I think, uh, I'm kind of like you,|sv
I don't have any strong opinions on it.|sd
I guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our, our neighbors down there is that we don't have any.|sv
We have more, -|%
I guess ties, -|%
we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything|sd
and we don't really, aren't that close to everyone in South America.|sd
I don't really know why though.|sd
Yeah,|b
I, I don't understand it either, although I, I think a lot of South Americans regard the United States as, as bullying.|sv
And, uh, that's certainly from a historical point of view, would be true.|sv
Right.|b
I mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking, in, in his wildest dreams from his neighbors.|sv
Right.|b
Yeah,|b
I know that I saw in a book, -|sd
I was reading a Spanish book, uh, not that I read Spanish, you know,|sd
I just, you know, reading some Spanish words|sd
and there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us to say, we're Americans.|sd
They would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too, you know,|sd
and I guess that's true.|sv
We don't think of any one else but oursel-, -|sv
I guess, we're kind of, uh, the smart asses in the world, I suppose, uh, or of America anyway.|sv
We think of ourselves as the only Americans, when they're Americans, too.|sv
Yeah,|b
well I think they're going to have, -|sv
that's a tough row for them to, to hoe because I think most of the world is going to regard, uh, citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans.|sv
As Mexicans,|^2
yes|b
that, that, -|%
And they can stand on their heads if they want too,|sv
but I don't think that they're going, they're going to change that,|sv
and,|sv
No,|aa
no,|aa
I know.|sd
I just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans, although, I guess, strictly speaking they are.|sv
Yeah,|aa
no,|aa
I mean they were saying that of us, that we're the North Americans and they're Americans,|sv
they, they, -|%
we always say we're Americans,|sv
and they, they want us to say we're the North Americans.|sv
Oh, I see|b
We're not Americans,|sv
we're North Americans|sv
and they're South Americans,|sv
yeah.|%
I don't know.|h
Whatever,|sv
I, I don't want to make, -|sd
I read it somewhere, though|sd
it's not my point, I guess,|sv
so -|%
Yeah,|b
well it's, it's so interesting, I ju-, I just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics.|sv
No,|aa
no,|aa
they, they were lucky enough to have some oil, what, ten years ago, an,|sv
and they, they blew all that, and borrowed enou-, more money than they can pay back now|sv
and, uh, uh, so they're not exactly business men.|sv
I do think we should deal more with them.|sv
I don't, I do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas, uh,|sd
for the language, you know, is very foolish. -|sd
I'm relativ-, relatively familiar with Texas school system|sd
and we should teach Spanish at least in, uh, grammar school, you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish.|sd
I think that helps, when you certainly can speak their language, uh,|sv
and there are problems with, you know, the wet back problem, you know,|sv
for, everyone knows what we're talking about,|sv
whe-, say wet back problem. -|sv
And then we should somehow, uh, -|sd
and I think the governments are working on that, to try to have some, uh, businesses, uh, at the borders of both sides so that you can, you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here an, to, to get the jobs, you know,|sv
there, there may be some organized way to do this.|sv
Yeah.|b
I, I do feel for them, uh,|sd
they are very envious of us, or they wouldn't be coming up here, you know, risking a lot.|sv
Not that they're risking their lives, of course, but risking a lot, uh,|sv
getting thrown back I guess is all that, uh, happens.|sd
Yeah.|b
You probably don't see that.|sv
Where, -|%
we see it, you know, once a month. I'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that.|sv
Well I grew up in Los Angeles.|sd
Okay,|b
well you see it, saw it out there then, too.|sd
And, uh, in fact, I drove a cab when I was a graduate student|sd
so I, I knew, uh, the Hispanic part of L A pretty well.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And certainly, you know, knew that problem,|sd
knew, you know, knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them, sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, it was, it was pretty wild.|sd
I think a, a common factor to a lot of problems, both, whether it be crime, if, if you want to jump on that, is mostly, uh, poverty.|sv
Uh, and I think a lot of their problems is poverty.|sv
If we could, uh, uh, -|sv
the problems we have, yo-, kno-, in this country, is, is a lot of it's poverty.|sv
Whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty, I, that's another story,|sv
but, uh, uh, it is sad.|sd
There, there's so much down in all of South America, uh, so much potential, you know,|sv
we're, -|%
T I, of course is, is really pushing world markets in their products|sd
and they're, they're mostly in, in Europe now and, in, in, in the Orient, Japan and Singapore now just announced building a plant in Singapore, uh,|sd
they're in Taiwan and Japan|sd
and they're, they haven't had, what, that much luck in South America|sd
and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there, for the products certainly that we make and everything.|sd
Yeah.|b
And there's got to be trade.|sd
I guess that's some of the answer, I guess is business, uh. Uh,|sv
and I try to be an optimist and say, well that, that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime, or certainly poverty obviously is to, is to get some business going between each other.|sv
And we need, we need to do more of that, uh, somehow. And encourage more business,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
They've got to have a lot of resources I would think. An enormous amount of, of well potential that way.|sv
A lot of it, of course is hot and jungle and all that,|sv
but, uh, there's got to be a lot of potential down there.|sv
Yeah,|b
Wha-, what are you taking in school,|qw
I didn't ask you that.|sd
What are you taking in school?|qw
Well I am actually, -|sd
Oh, yo-, you're an instructor,|^2
Yeah.|aa
yeah,|b
you're an instructor,|sd
yeah,|%
you said.|sd
Yeah,|b
I'm the, I'm the teacher,|sd
I give, as it were. -|sd
That's great.|ba
Are you teaching Computer Science?|qy
Wha-, -|%
you said, what were you saying you were teaching there?|qw
Yeah,|b
I'm in Computer Science|sd
Great,|ba
great.|ba
but of course, this project is really one to collect a data base of, of, uh, of casual speech, uh, in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like.|sd
Right.|b
I, of course, I work at T I|sd
and I'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time, why that isn't enough.|sd
I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm getting a kick out of the whole program|sd
but, uh, there's going to be I guess thousands, I don't know how many thousands, or tens of thousands of these recordings|sd
and I wonder how they're going to analyze them. Whether it would be listening to them or analyzing,|sd
I gu-, -|%
they've got to be analyzing with a, a voice recorder some how.|sv
Yeah,|b
well they record these|sd
and then somebody transcribes them so that they,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and what, -|%
and what is said. -|sd
Right.|b
And they have a, they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening|sd
and that's, uh, a big problem in speech recognition.|sd
Oh, yes.|b
I know they change with age,|sd
I know mine changes, uh, has changed, uh, -|sd
although you, you never found, -|sd
your, your voice echoes in your own head which is, makes it different than what it really sounds to other people.|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh, I'm sure singers and professional people know that,|sv
and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say, my God, that's, that's not, obviously that's not me, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, I know your voice in your own head resonates a different way.|sd
Uh, go ahead,|ad
yo-, you comment on it,|ad
yeah,|%
I'm glad that you're in the business.|sd
That, -|%
I kno-, -|%
T I -s gotten with their Speak and Spell and everything, -|sd
I've told my wife, that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer,|sd
Right.|b
you wouldn't have to have a keyboard,|sv
you'll be able to just give it commands|sv
and I'm sure they have some of that now,|sd
and not, not, in computers but a lot of potential, of course for handicapped people,|sv
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I hope you know more about the subject of baseball|sd
and where they're going than I do beca-, -|sd
Oh, I know a little bit about it.|sd
I'm not a die-hard fan|sd
but I, I enjoy the, -|sd
I like the Boston Red Sox myself.|sd
Well, I, -|%
of all the sports that there are, that there is, I like baseball the best.|sd
However, I haven't been to a baseball game in years,|sd
but I have kept, uh, my eye on the Rangers.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know -|qy
and I guess they were doing pretty good up to a point,|sd
and then they kind of fell on their face|sd
Well, with, uh, -|%
their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately,|sd
so. -|%
Correct,|ba
right.|b
Right|b
Oh, it's amazing.|ba
They're so astronomical I can't even imagine --|sd
Right.|b
You know it's just, uh, phenomenal|sd
Well, fortunately the Red Sox, last time I saw the paper earlier this week, were in first place and doing quite well.|sd
Well, good.|ba
Um, I've been really busy at work this past week|sd
and normally on my way into work I'll pick up a newspaper|sd
and, uh, i-, -|%
so every day I'll have a newspaper at work,|sd
and when I take a break, I'll take a look at the newspaper.|sd
But this week I've been so busy I didn't even bother to stop|sd
I understand.|ba
I understand.|ba
But hopefully, hopefully next week I'll get back to my normal routine.|sd
Okay.|b
Uh, you are involved with T I -s, uh, speech, um, recognition?|qy
Well, not really.|ng
I, um --|sd
How did you find out about it?|qw
Oh, okay.|bk
From, uh, -|%
I'm an officer in the Air Force,|sd
I see.|ba
Interesting.|ba
Oh, great.|ba
And, uh, the speech laboratory does some work with, uh, T I,|sd
I see.|ba
but, uh, in my division they do,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, that's good.|ba
Well, that's interesting.|ba
And the topics are interesting, uh,|sd
they run a whole gamut of, of, uh, subjects,|sd
and, uh, I think we can address every topic,|sv
but the depth of knowledge is quite different.|sv
Sure.|b
Sure.|b
So, uh, when they chose baseball, -|sd
I mean, I'm, I'm, I can understand baseball, you know,|sd
I don't understand football.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, I prefer to, -|sd
I, I like, -|sd
I never used to really like watching football that much|sd
but more and more these days I'm, I'll like a football game,|sd
but I've always liked baseball.|sd
I, I prefer to watch, um, -|sd
I guess I'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football.|sv
And I, I'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game.|sd
Well, I, I can relate to baseball because I used to play baseball.|sd
But I can't relate to football because I've never,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I said if I ever had a son, he would not play football.|sd
And, uh, I had four daughters|sd
so that wasn't a question,|sd
but now I have a grandson that i-, you know, is gung ho for, uh, football.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, -|%
Well, there's injuries in a lot of sport.|sd
I understand that,|ba
I'd, I, -|%
but I think the, they happen more in football.|sv
I think the odds are cut down.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, I, I know they can get hurt in baseball too.|sv
The bat is a very heavy object, can do a lot of damage|sv
but, uh, I think that they have a, a lower racial of injuries,|sv
it's true.|aa
I, I would say that baseball tends to be one of the less,|sv
Because the-, -|%
Yeah.|b
but, uh, for some people it's just, uh, uh, -|sd
A love for them.|^2
Well, that, -|%
not so much that -|ar
but, uh, even in baseball you can, -|sv
like when I played baseball when I was growing up, I had trouble, uh, uh, just throwing the ball because I wa-, very, I was always very strong|sd
and I could-, th-, -|%
when I was young I could throw harder,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I see.|ba
And so I was always throwing my arm out and, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, and I was a catcher|sd
so I was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and k-, that kind of stuff.|sd
So I, -|%
that was always a problem for me was just, just the constant throwing,|sd
so. -|%
Did you, did you sustain any permanent, uh, injury with that?|qy
No,|nn
I did that wrestling|sd
Oh.|b
Oh, okay.|bk
No,|nn
I'd, -|%
well, I, I, uh, always been quite an athlete and doing different things|sd
and, um, the other thing was I'd never really let injuries stop me.|sd
But interestingly enough you mentioned football, is like, -|sd
now I won't play football anymore because of the, uh, the separated shoulder wrestling,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
so. Um, but I stood the, stood the injury wrestling,|sd
but it, -|%
as long as I let it heal, it never really bothered me|sd
then playing football this fall,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it seemed to be,|sd
Oh, boy.|ba
so. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I have, uh, I have a broken arm that I had since I was three.|sd
It was never set right.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, uh, I liked bowling as a, as a kind of a relaxing sport.|sd
And, uh, one of the men that was in our rel-, on our league, uh, noticed, uh, you know, uh, my broken arm and the way my ball would do.|sd
And he says, let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage.|sd
And so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eighty-seven.|sd
My God.|ba
So, uh, yeah|b
Um, it was really funny, you know, that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and, and how to, uh, follow through with my, uh, -|sd
addressing that , to put the ball, -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
the, uh, pins. -|%
So that was interesting.|sd
So I really, um, I got a lot of, uh, recognition from the, uh, uh, the bowling league, I guess.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I'm not sure where all my pins came from,|sd
but it's, -|%
but that was quite awhile ago|sd
but I, and I never pursued it.|sd
And a lot of people said, well, you should have turned pro.|sd
And I thought, no,|sd
not m-, -|%
m-, -|%
I don't, -|%
my love wasn't there for the game.|sd
I liked to as a, as a method of, uh, entertainment and I, uh,|sd
Sure.|b
but outside of that, no.|sd
I didn't.|sd
And I, and I still, I like to bowl,|sd
but, uh, I don't have, uh, Jack standing behind me to tell me what to do|sd
Are you on, you on any leagues now?|qy
No,|nn
I'm not.|sd
Oh.|b
No.|nn
No, uh,|nn
at T I they have a sponsor, a junior league achievement|sd
and, uh, it's true bowling|sd
and I've never, uh, shared that with them.|sd
I would have to brush up on my bowling before I even tried to, uh, win a lot of money for the junior achievement,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But that's the only thing that I would, you know, be to do.|sd
Right.|b
Well, my grandmother has been bowling for, gosh, maybe thirty, forty years.|sd
I don't know,|h
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
a long time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And she still, she's got to be, -|sd
Still carries a good lim-, uh, average?|qy^d
Well, no,|nn
she does-, -|%
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc

All the farmers, you know, -|sd

I, I'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field,|sd
and if we don't have rain, she's going to lose a lot of money.|sd
Oh, my goodness.|ba
Well, we have been drenched.|sd
Oh|b
We have had so much rain for May and June that we've got all the, uh, weather people down here really confused.|sd
Oh, my.|ba
Uh, we, -|%
it's probably, -|%
it, it's just, -|%
It's usually dry down there, isn't it?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Right now, -|sd

no,|nn
you know, it's quit raining, you know, by at least a month.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it's still, -|%
we're still having April showers,|sd
Oh, I hope they come,|sd
Yeah,|b
uh, I don't know where, where it came from|sd
but it's been really, -|sd
we got a lot of, uh, -|sd
we're in central Texas|sd
and it feels like we live in Houston.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yeah,|ny
it's, it, it, you know, -|%
like it rained today|sd
and then it just kind of steamed everything up, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system,|sd
We've had some with really, really high winds that have trashed trees and,|sd
Oh, my.|ba
It's just, -|%
Now see, every, everyone up here with their gardens they're not going to have much of a garden this year because it's so dry.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, I hope you get some of that.|sd
Yeah.|b
We got enough.|sd
We have had plenty,|sd
and we're still, uh, forecast for more.|sd
Really?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Well, gee,|ba
So, -|%
uh, does Califor-, is California getting rain then?|qy
Uh, I'm not real sure.|h
I think a lot of this is coming out of, -|sv
I think what's happen-, of -|%
it's coming out of Canada,|sd
Out of the Gulf?|^2
and it's meeting what's coming out of the Gulf.|sd
Oh.|b
And it's just causing chaos|sv
Yeah.|b
so it's been, it's been, uh, wet.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we've moved our yard I think three or four times in the last two or three weeks.|sd
Oh, my gosh.|ba
I mean just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing|sd
and, and one, one week it just rained, thunderstormed for a day straight|sd
and you couldn't get out there.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You just couldn't get out there.|sv
By the time you finally got out there where your lawn mower wouldn't sink, we were, you know, -|sd
yeah,|%
lawn mower broke|sd
So, -|%
Oh, well, see, now we need, -|sd
we could use two days straight of rain.|sd
Oh.|b
It's really drying up, up here.|sd
Well, what always works for me is if I water my plants or we wash the car, it usually rains.|sd
If not that night, the next day|sd
Does it?|^g
I was telling everyone, hang your clothes out on the line|sd
and it's surely going to rain.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Um,|b
We've had real hot weather.|sd
Hotter than usual?|qy
Yeah,|ny
yes.|ny
We, you know, -|%
and, uh, let me think.|^h
I got out of school in May.|sd
In March I was wearing shorts.|sd
Wow.|ba
I was wearing shorts in March up at college,|sd
and, uh, we, w-, -|%
what they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring.|sd
Huh.|b
Is what they said what happened.|qh
Huh.|b
I hope that, -|sd
Oh, I don't know.|h
But, -|%
I hope that doesn't mean we're going to get an early winter.|sd
No.|nn
I wouldn't think so.|sv
I wouldn't, -|%
not as early as it came. -|sd
I mean your talking September, maybe.|sv
Yeah.|b
That's a little early.|sv
Still the, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
I was wearing shorts in March.|sd
You know it was nippy --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, um, like it was still in the seventies.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, high sixties low seventies in March.|sd
Yeah.|b
And we were there, we were in New Jersey last October --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and it was hotter there than it was here.|sd
Yes.|b
It was just like a heat wave.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
we haven't, -|%
and we just died.|sd
Oh, my gosh.|ba
It was really hot,|sd
so.|sd
Huh.|b
I wouldn't, I wouldn't trade it for snow any day.|sd
Really?|bh
Yeah.|ny
See I like, I like the snow|sd
but I like to watch it fall,|sd
and I just like it where it's deep enough, you know, but not too deep.|sd
Right.|b
And I can handle a vacation in it|sd
and, you know, but my husband is from New Jersey|sd
and he wouldn't go back either.|sd
He did all the,|sd
Really?|bh
He said it was a pain.|sd
So, -|%
Well, isn't it weird at Christmas time without snow?|qy
No.|nn
I don't think so.|sd
Well, see last year we had snow at Christmas time.|sd
Oh.|b
So it really wasn't, it was weird because we had snow|sd
It's like, wow, it actually fell on the right day.|sd
So, uh, no,|nn
it's not.|sd
In fact, uh, you know, we're used to running around in, you know, spring clothes in December,|sd
and so when it throws in a real cool winter, we get broken pipes and, and all that kind of stuff and because Texas is, just isn't built for --|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, it's real dry down there.|sd
You don't have the humidity either, do you?|qy
No,|nn
not, not were we are.|sd
Now in Houston and stuff they've got it, they've got it where no hairsprayer works.|sd
It's so humid at times,|sd
but here it's, it's just about right.|sd
It's, it's pretty dry and, not too dry where, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but --|sd
Yeah.|b
We're just having this, all this rain,|sd
and late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable.|sd
Made it,|sd
Yeah,|b
muggy, huh?|^2
But no,|nn
I like it.|sd
Well, we're right in a good stop because we're, you know, we get over in the, over the hundreds in the summer,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it's, it's not, it's a dry heat|sd
and it's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus ninety degree humidity,|sd
Yeah.|b
so. -|%
See that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real, you know, hundred and the high nineties, we have the humidity to go with it,|sv
Oh.|b
so you're like real mucky|sd
and you, you know, -|qy
yo-, your legs stick together just from walking --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I know what, -|ba
So, um, -|%
So we like it where we're at.|sd
If it's not a whole bunch of everything at once --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
So. But no,|nn
it's interesting when it gets really cold here|sd
and people forget that they're, live in Texas|sd
and they don't know how to drive in snow|sd
and,|sd
Oh, that's good.|ba
I was born in Texas|sd
and I visited other areas,|sd
and I'm just a sun person I think.|sd
I've gotten used to it.|sd
Well, I don't know|h
Well, I guess that's really about all.|sd
Yeah,|b
weather is not real hard to talk about|sv
It doesn't last real long either.|sv
I thought the weather is the last thing you talk about,|sd
but in this case it's the only thing to talk about.|sd
But, well, Michelle, it's great talking to, -|fc
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Um, the last movie that I have seen, -|sd
it's been, it's been a couple of months.|sd
I saw, um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY --|sd
Yes,|b
I saw that one.|sd
Those were the last two that I've seen.|sd
What was the second one?|br
FLATLINERS.|sd
I didn't see that one.|sd
Oh.|b
Did you see those because of, uh, Julia Roberts, or for, uh, the subject matter of the two?|qy
Oh, it was just, -|sd
well, someone had, -|sd
I had seen the advertisement for FLATLINERS on T V,|sd
and I thought I'd like it,|sd
and then, uh, one of my friends who went to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, and she told me to go.|sd
It was good.|sd
So that's why I saw that one.|sd
Uh-huh|b
Well, I've, uh, -|%
I saw SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY|sd
and I, um, I've seen, uh, well , just recently, um, WHAT ABOUT BOB?|sd
No,|nn
I haven't gotten to see an-, you know, any real recent ones.|sd
I like comedies better than I do dramas.|sd
I, uh, am not one for the, uh, -|sd
I don't need the suspense movies or the,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Did you care for SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?|qy
Um, I'm not sure|no
I, uh, I saw it and, uh, because my wife wanted to see it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, but on the other hand, I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise,|sd
and having gone, uh, -|%
well, it really wasn't on a theme that I was, uh, uh, that into,|sd
or, as I say, th-, I prefer the light movies that, uh, -|sd
my style of entertainment is, is comedy, uh, primarily --|sd
Uh-huh --|b
-- well, I didn't care for the movie myself.|sd
What?|br
I didn't really care for the movie either.|sd
Yeah,|b
you kind of have to like to be, uh, drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen.|sv
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
Well, okay,|b
on likewise then, did you see PRETTY WOMAN?|qy
Uh, yes.|ny
Do you enjoy that one?|qy
Uh, it was interesting,|na
Uh-huh.|b
well, I'm trying to think of the other one I saw recently, the one on, um, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.|sd
Oh, I haven't even heard of that one.|sd
Well, that was one where, uh, -|sd
it's kind of like, -|%
to me it's somewhat like PRETTY WOMAN.|sv
The, the story line, um, -|sd
if you accept a few of the basic starting points, I guess the rest falls in place.|sd
Uh, it was hard to accept that, uh, this, uh, multimillionaire wheeler dealer would, uh, would, you know, find himself and allow himself to get into that situation.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|%
Well, I really liked PRETTY WOMAN.|sd
You know, I just, -|%
well, you just kind of went with it.|sd
Like you said, you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go.|sd
Yeah.|b
It's sort of a modern CINDERELLA type of story.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, um, FLATLINERS, now, it's a drama,|sd
and I don't usually like them,|sd
and I really enjoyed it.|sd
I, um, I don't know,|h
it was kind of, -|%
it made you think a lot --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Did you see GHOST?|qy
Yes.|ny
Okay,|bk
now, did you care for that one?|qy
Uh, that was, -|%
I enjoyed that one.|na
I, in that I, I guess I, I hate to be too surprised in a movie,|sd
and in that one you could, you could pretty well guess where it was,|sd
You weren't sure exactly how it would get there,|sv
but you knew where it would end up.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
See, now, I didn't, -|%
I thought it was an okay movie,|sv
but it wasn't something that I would enjoy seeing twice or three times.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I didn't think so, um,|sd
I really didn't care for the ending of it.|sd
I thought it was just of like you didn't know this was going to happen,|sv
when, you know, -|%
but, um, I don't know, you know.|h
Well, of course, uh, a bunch of girls had told me and warned me,|sd
and they said, "Oh, it's a real tearjerker," and da, da, da, da, da.|sd
Meanwhile, I sat through the movie and said well, when are you, when are you supposed to start crying, you know|sd
Yeah.|b
I didn't really,|sd
Well, whenever she starts crying|sd
Well, do you go to many movies more than once?|qy
Um, if I see them more than once, I see them on video.|na
Uh-huh.|b
But like you said, I, I enjoy the comedies a lot better.|sd
In fact, that's where I've seen most of my movies, have been on video.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, these days it's, uh, -|%
You see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen.|sv
Well, if you don't, with some of the movies, if you don't go to them within the first four weeks, the movie may have, uh, left town, never to show up again until it comes back in video.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So, uh, unless a movie is popular and stays around, uh, you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie.|sv
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
So we have, um, -|%
well, I think just most people have V C R -s now|sv
and we probably watch twice as many movies at home --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
No,|nn
I saw one, it was a drama also,|sd
and I can't think of the name of it now, that, um, -|sd
it was a book before it came out in a movie,|sd
and it was, it w-, it was a drama.|sd
Did you go to DANCES WITH WOLVES?|qy
I wanted to see that.|sd
I didn't get to.|sd
I, at least what I hear on that one, that it's coming out a second time in a, in a longer version --|sd
Oh, really?|bh
It's sort of the uncut version.|sd
At least that was some of the rumors.|h
We'll have to see, because it's, uh, there was some talk about that.|sd
I, -|%
maybe it will come out this fall.|sd
There, -|%
we're sort of in the middle of the summer, um, season of a lot of new movies coming out,|sd
but then there's these, um, periods like early fall before Christmas or early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again, it, uh, will increase the revenues from the movie.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, um, what movies are showing down there now?|qw
Oh, I, I'd actually have to get a newspaper out.|sd
My approach to movies is I kind of hear about them, uh,|sd
I keep track of them a little,|sd
but, you know, ask me to name the ten that are out there right now,|sd
and I'd have to say, uh, I, uh, I don't know.|sd
I, I just look at the newspaper before I decide to go|sd
and, -|%
Yeah,|b
that's pretty much what I do.|sd
I, I know for sure that that one about, -|sd
what was that one about Bob?|qw
Uh, it's kind of,|sd
I think it's just, -|sv
Yeah,|b
I think it's just playing now up here.|sv
Yeah.|b
Because some of them, they, uh, they'll start in one area of the country,|sv
and if they it's, -|%
In, in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that I know and lawyers and whatnot, I think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem.|sv
Do you?|^g
Why?|qw
Why?|qw
Well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to, so they could become doctors, the problem would go away.|sv
You think the problem is not enough doctors?|qy
I think the problem is that the doctor v-, doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums on your h-, uh, unemp-, I mean, on your liability.|na
Gosh,|ba
Oh?|bh
Uh-huh.|b
And you think there are plenty of doctors?|qy
Oh, yeah,|ny
I don't think there is a shortage of doctors|sd
and I do know that O B, which is my field --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's astronomical.|ba
Now they can't doing anything about that.|sv
I don't think they're in a conspiracy.|sv
I think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them.|sv
No,|ar
people don't sue --|sv
People are very sue, sue conscious.|sv
-- lawyers sue.|sv
If you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor --|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, that's probably true, too.|aa
But people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days.|sv
Well, sure.|ba
And, so, -|%
But, you know, when you think about reasonableness, now, I believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory.|sv
You know what tort theory is?|qy
No.|nn
Well, a tort is when you do something wrong.|sd
Right.|b
Well, it, uh, -|%
an O B G Y N doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent.|sv
That's right.|aa
If the baby is born dead, well, that happens.|sv
Well, -|%
If, if they have complications and, -|sv
It depends.|aap_am
Well, I know, I mean, there are guys that are real slobs,|sd
but you know, there are also people out there that are really doing their job.|sd
Well, that's true,|aa
they are --|sv
Many of them are unnecessary,|sv
they are doing so many C sections --|sd
Just to prevent a --|sv
Because they have all these monitors now|sd
and if anything looks even a little bit funny --|sv
Yeah.|b
and --|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
See, I believe --|sd
So, it's terrible.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, they have indigent health care.|sv
You show up at Parkland bleeding --|sd
You'll get it.|^2
That's true.|aa
In fact, you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there, too.|sd
Yeah.|b
And we have that happen.|sd
We have patients that go through Parkland --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and at the last minute, they come to us.|sd
Well --|sd
Uh-huh|b
So, -|%
Yeah,|b
I think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation --|sv
Yeah.|b
I'm for that.|aa
I've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer,|sd
so --|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, I, I happen to know a few|sd
and I even claim one as a friend.|sd
He's a divorce attorney.|sd
But, -|%
He better not be mine|sd
I think he'll go nameless for the, for the purposes of this conversation.|sv
But I also know an, uh, O B G Y N who has stopped practicing.|sd
Yeah,|b
some they do. -|sv
Uh, he just said, -|sd
They stop their O B at least.|sd
Yeah,|b
I mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies --|sd
Right,|b
Right.|b
His malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year.|sd
That's incredible.|ba
And, you know, he said, I had to, he had to ear-, gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice.|sd
Yeah.|b
And most of them are very sincere.|sv
Most of them do the --|sv
Yeah|b
They are human.|sd
Occasionally --|sd
Well, you can be human and Catholic.|sv
I know you can be human and Catholic,|aa
but, you're not likely to find somebody who is going to, you know, have a less conscientious effort.|sv
Yeah,|b
no --|nn
I mean, -|%
-- most of them do.|sv
I really believe that.|sd
From dealing with doctors, dealing with lawyers, there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious.|sv
Well, you know, who is getting rich?|qw
Insurance companies.|sv
Yeah,|aa
they are.|aa
You know, if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance, -|sv
say, say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed|sd
or, -|%
Well, um, I have a, a, a former exercise program.|sd
I'm a graduate student,|sd
and this semester, I'll tell you what, I, it's been almost impossible for me to get, you know, back to regular exercise.|sd
Um, last summer I was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard,|sd
so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming|sd
and, um, and since I worked at a recreation center I could, uh, you know, use those facilities quite often.|sd
But, um. -|b
Oh, yeah.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
and --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
and there's --|sd
I, -|%
Pardon?|br
It's the least hard on your body --|sd
Exactly, yeah,|aa
um, flu-, -- -|%
and -|%
-- yeah,|b
fluid resistance.|bf
Right,|aa
right.|aa
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
How about you?|qo
Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week,|sd
but it's not enough to, -|%
boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
-- and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
but --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Do you, do you kind of think it's a chore,|qy
or do you enjoy it?|qrr
I like it.|na
Uh-huh.|b
I like it, uh,|sd
part of my problem is I have small children,|sd
so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Sure,|b
yeah.|%
Of course, you got a little different direction going,|sv
but, uh. -|%
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|%
Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds,|sd
and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um,|sd
so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college,|sd
and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly,|sd
and so I got my weight down,|sd
and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be --|sd
Right,|b
you don't notice it --|^2
, yeah.|%
yeah.|%
Uh-huh.|aa
Although lately I have noticed, you know, even if I gain, like two pounds, I start, I start feeling it|sd
and, -|%
You feel it, don't you?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
It's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes,|sd
and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years,|sd
but, uh, it's changed places|sd
And things don't fit just quite exactly --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, so, do you do, uh, -|qy
in Texas, uh, does -|%
there, probably quite a few facilities.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
there are.|sd
Um, I'm living in a dorm right now,|sd
and so right downstairs there's a facility.|sd
And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there|sd
Do you enjoy it,|qy
or is it, uh. -|qrr
If you can have, find the time --|^2
Uh-huh --|b
-- yeah,|aa
I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while,|sd
but that's hard, you know.|sd
Yeah,|b
it is hard --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- it is hard.|sd
It's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier --|sd
Exactly.|aa
Don't get enough sleep as it is,|sd
right --|^g
Uh-huh,|ny
yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
-- and, uh, kind of have, -|%
if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of, -|sv
course it's really, you know, -|sv
as soon as you do it, it's really a release.|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
You feel invigorated|sv
and you feel --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
ready to go another twelve hours.|^2
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?|qy
I do.|na
I have to be real careful.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.|sd
Did you?|^g
Uh-huh,|ny
completely.|sd
I mean, any kind of meat -|sd
or, and I, and I really feel a lot better now.|sd
Makes a lot of difference.|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
it really does.|sd
Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|%
that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from --|sd
Right.|b
-- and so. I found that really helps.|sd
And unless you really like, uh, fish.|sd
Fish is pretty good for you,|sd
but, uh. -|%
Yeah,|b
I eat that,|sd
I think I've eaten fish like twice since. -|sd
I used to eat a lot of fish, too,|sd
but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.|sd
Kind of see what happens.|^2
Yeah,|aa

I've tried to do that with sugar|sd
I don't know if I'm that brave yet .|sd

I mean, if you go, -|sv
your ketchup has sugar in it.|sd

Pardon?|fc
I'm studying speech pathology.|fc
Right.|fc
Are we tonight?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Sure.|sd
Okay,|b
well let me go ahead and press one|oo_co_cc
Okay, Leslie,|b
I'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies.|sd
What do you like to do in your spare time?|qw
Well, and when I have my spare time|sd
Actually, it's a cherished commodity now days, huh.|sv
That's right.|aa
Uh, I do enjoy, uh, sewing,|sd
I hand, uh, -|%
I do some needlepoint.|sd
Oh, great.|ba
And I, I've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law,|sd
but if I, uh, ever get enough spare time,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And some other things I like to do are, is music and, uh, also reading.|sd
What kind of music?|qw
Well I enjoy singing.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
Yeah.|b
Well great.|ba
I enjoy music too|sd
and I, uh, -|%
one thing that I like to do, uh, is sit down and play the piano.|sd
I can't play that well,|sd
Um.|b
I enjoy that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, a couple of hobbies that I also have is, uh, -|sd
I really enjoy bike riding|sd
and the biggest hobbies I have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in.|sd
Yes.|b
Like my, uh, oldest boy is involved in soccer|sd
so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football|sd
and, uh, we also like to, uh, ride bicycles.|sd
So we're riding bicycles|sd
and so a lot of the hobbies that I have right now are centered around my, my children and also things that my wife and I like to do --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And uh, so personally a lot of the hobbies I had when I was growing up and, uh, going to college and so forth are having to change.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I really enjoyed, uh, mountain climbing.|sd
I really enjoyed skiing. Uh, and a lot of outdoor activities.|sd
Uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in Texas --|sd
That's right.|aa
but hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day|sd
but, -|%
Oh yeah.|b
I have not had the opportunity to go skiing|sd
but, uh, I grew up in Arizona which has some mountains around it|sd
but --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You didn't?|qy
No,|nn
I never did.|sd
Didn't have the, uh, I guess I didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing|sd
and of course, I was at that you know stage of my life where I had to be taken to p-, places.|sd
I couldn't go by myself.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
That's true.|aa
And then of course, once I got to the age where I could have done it myself, I had other interests I guess.|sd
So -|%
Oh yeah.|b
I guess that for me it was very helpful.|sd
My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.|sd
Oh yeah.|b
And so we, we went quite often|sd
and, uh, in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing.|sd
When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago|sd
and we would go skiing and enjoy that.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, but, uh, luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies, it's a, it's a nice thing to have|sd
and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to. Like you mentioned|sd
and I am finding out, a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there.|sd
That's right.|aa
It's, uh, it's, uh, taken up by activities with, uh, work, with family, with, uh, civic and Church responsibilities for me.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
Yeah,|b
I, I find if I, I make I have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me|sd
Oh yeah.|b
Oh yeah.|b
Oh yeah|b
Yeah.|b
And my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer|sd
so she's real excited about doing that.|sd
Well, great.|ba
We will be busy with that again.|sd
What, again.|br
So you have participated with that in the past?|qy
Pardon me?|br
Have you par-, participated in that in the past?|qy
Well, I did with my older daughter --|na
Uh-huh.|b
-- and she was in it for a few years,|sd
but she has got so many interests herself that,|sd
and well the first one to go. -|sd
She still likes her piano --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and she is in band.|sd
So, she's got lots of hobbies or, uh, activities going on.|sd
It sounds like her life is full too.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I imagine your life is full --|sv
Very much.|aa
That's right|aa
That's right.|aa
All right.|b
All right.|b
Well, Leslie, it's been very nice talking to you.|fc
Is there anything else that you would like to --|fc
Uh.|fc
or, -|fc
No,|fc
I think we covered it pretty good.|fc
Oh, okay.|fc
Great.|fc
Thank you for calling.|fc
Well thank you|fc
and you have a nice evening.|fc
You too.|fc
Bye,|fc
bye.|fc
Bye now.|fc
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Well, are you a fisher person, are you?|qy
Yes,|ny
I love to fish.|sd
Great.|ba
What kind of fishing do you do?|qw
Well, it's mostly from the rivers and lakes.|sd
In California?|qy
And, yes,|ny
and from the banks.|sd
I don't like to go out on boats.|sd
Oh.|b
Well, what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods?|qw
Well, it, uh, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
But, I like it all except, uh, really I don't, I don't really care that much for the trout.|sd
I think I had rather have a catfish than I would a trout|sd
Well, I, I don't blame you.|sd
I grew up in Nebraska and, uh, grew up fish, cat fishing in the Little Blue River|sd
and then, uh, we moved to, uh, South Dakota --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, now that we are down here, I think a lot of people do some, uh, bass fishing and strip bass fishing|sd
but, uh, I still, uh, I am sort of a catfish man at heart.|sd
See. Well, uh, like in, uh, Iowa and Nebraska, those little bullheads, they look just like catfish, huh?|qy
Yep.|ny
Yeah,|ny
they do.|sd
You know that's what I mean cause I am from Iowa.|sd
Oh.|b
And, uh, you know, we use to catch those little bullheads|sd
and that's, -|%
they look just like baby catfish.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, uh, did you get to go fishing very often?|qy
Oh yeah.|ny
I like to fish.|sd
The only problem is I just moved to Texas|sd
so it's been a little over a year now|sd
but, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I, so really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and it's driving me crazy|sd
but, uh, one of these days, I will go over to, uh, Lake Lewisville or, uh, what is it, uh Ray Hubbard, Lake Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, uh, you like to eat them after you catch them?|qy
Well, yeah,|ny
sure.|sd
Because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing,|sv
Well mo-, -|%
Yeah.|b
Most of the time, uh, if we catch something, we'll take it home and eat it.|sd
Uh, and you're right.|aa
I mean I like to fish for trout|sd
and they are really, uh, uh, good fighters|sd
but, uh, if I went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing I would order if I had a choice of fish on the menu.|sd
Yeah,|b
I know.|ba
Yeah.|b
Well, uh, so, do you just, uh, uh, skin your catfish|qy
or do you fillet them out,|qrr
how do you, how do you, -|qw
We, uh, skin them.|sd
Do you?|^g
Yeah.|ny
Okay.|bk
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Just cut their heads off and skin them|sd
and then I just, uh, flour them, salt and pepper them and cook them.|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't put that corn meal on them.|sd
No.|nn
You know, uh, that's the way my mother taught me to fry them|sd
so -|%
Well, that's how we do it too.|sd
Uh, although we, uh, use to set some, uh, trout lines out|sd
and we've caught, you know, fourteen, fifteen pound catfish|sd
and sometimes those are good to, uh, do on a barbecue grill --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then the skin just basically scrapes right off|sd
and, uh, wer-, -|%
and it really tastes pretty good.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well you know, I don't think I've ever tried cooking those, uh, catfish quite that big.|sd
There, uh, -|%
Uh, most of them are just the small, you know, pan frying ones.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, uh, -|%
Well, I am hoping one of these days I'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on, uh, a rod and reel|sd
but, uh --|sd
Um.|b
so, -|%
Wouldn't that be something?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Yeah.|ny
And, uh, well up in, uh, South Dakota on the, in the Missouri River there we've, uh, tied into a few northern pike|sd
and, uh, they really, uh, -|%
in, in, -|%
when the water is cold, they are very slow moving fish,|sd
but in the summer time, they'll, uh, give you a run for your money.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So when you were, -|sd
when you did go fishing where did you go?|qw
You moved there from where?|qw
Nebraska?|^g
Uh-huh.|ny
Yeah.|ny
So, it was just like the rivers and, uh, the --|qy^d
In,|qy
Yeah.|ny
Uh, yeah.|ny
Most of the time, uh, we just fished, uh, in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that, that we could fish in.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And a lot of them ended up being close to the river,|sd
so if the river every, uh, flooded, you know, then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so we would do a lot of fishing there too|sd
but, uh, South Dakota didn't really have much for, -|sd
Afternoon, Doug,|fp
it certainly is, uh, going to be a pleasure to chat with you.|fp
Uh-huh.|b
And I'm, uh, certainly was surprised to, uh, to hear from you.|sd
Normally I talk to people in Plano, Texas.|sd
Yeah,|aa
me too.|aa
How did you get on this list?|qw
Uh, through Nancy Dahlgren.|sd
She, um, she had somehow gotten the information from T I --|sd
Well, okay.|bk
All right.|b
Well, now, what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy?|qw
What ideas do you have on that, Doug?|qo
Um, see, I'm not sure that, -|%
I don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country,|sd
but I think that the opportunity is definitely there for, um, people to invade your privacy when they want to,|sv
I think it's, um, -|%
In what manner?|qw
Well, it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone.|sd
It's completely trivial to, for instance, listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone, since they're just radio signals.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It's, um, -|%
and let's see,|^h
well, what's the first thing that comes to your mind?|qo
Well, the thing that I thought they were, uh, concerned about was, was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and in reality in many cases, they knew, or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations.|sd
And I thought was, uh, beginning to invade the privacy of people, because the things about where you live and, and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business,|sd
and they in return, come back and try to sell you something with this additional knowledge.|sd
To me that's an invasion of privacy.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I agree with you there, for sure.|aa
Um, and I think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get.|sv
It's possible for almost anyone to get information about your credit history, for instance, if they just, um, twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's, you know, possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history, not to mention, change it if he wants to.|sv
You mean your history in regards to, uh --|br
Well, um. -|%
Well, yes,|ny
well, for instance, yes, um,|ny
and they'll probably goes into other things, like, you know, your records with the government or utility companies or anything.|sd
Do you consider these serious, uh, problems?|qy
Um, uh, not, not yet anyways, because I don't think they're widespread enough,|ng
but I think they have the potential of becoming serious problems.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, what should we do about it,|qw
or what could be done about it, do you think --|qrr
Um --|sv
and there are certainly benefits to its doing so,|sv
and it's hard to, hard to say whether the, um, risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not,|sd
and I'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they don't.|sd
Why,|qw
do you see any out for us?|qy
Well, I would think that, uh, information held on records, uh, by any company or charge card dealer or person should be absolutely private and, and not be allowed to be, uh, to, given out by those companies.|na
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, it should be made a, a, uh, national or a state law to protect people so that, uh, you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
In other words, if you call the company yourself, directly, uh, and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else, uh, you know, from the outside, so to speak --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
I. -|%
-- but, but we have no control of that now --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then, uh, you, you're, when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you, you feel that it someday might be used against you.|sv
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Well, Carolyn, the, uh, one of the main things I'd like, like to know is, uh, how do you feel about the, knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth.|qo
Well. -|%
What do you think would be required, and so forth?|qo
Uh, I'll tell you,|^h
I, I watched what went on, um, with the TWENTY TWENTY show, I don't know if you saw that a few days ago that, that talked about nursing homes,|qy^d
and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where I am, here in Texas,|sd
and -- -|%
Oh, you knew of the homes, then.|qy
-- Pardon?|br
You knew of the homes themselves?|qy
Well, I, -|%
no,|nn
I'm not familiar with those homes per se --|sd
Uh-huh|b
-- but, um, they were in the area where I live --|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
and it was really revealing to see some of the, you know, the things that go on, I guess, in some of these homes,|sd
so I would definitely, you know, want to really check things out and, uh, go,|sd
I guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that, to, to make sure that you went daily, you know --|sv
Yeah.|b
and, -|%
Well, from your point of view, how would you feel about actually sending someone that, that's, you know, means something to you to one of those homes.|qw
I realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it --|bf
Uh-huh.|aa
-- and, of course, that makes sense,|ba
but how do you think they would feel, I should say, about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new, new home situation?|qo
Well, actually, I have that kind of situation, because my mother lives with me,|arp_nd
and she's --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, okay.|bk
-- and, uh, from the time that we were tiny, she said, you know, I want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So I know how she feels about it.|sd
You know, if I, uh --|sd
Yes.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I think that would be the, -|sd
Well, how do you find that your, your personal relationship is with her, know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal?|qo
Does that, does that cause any problems between the two of you?|qy
Uh, I wouldn't say any more than usual.|ng
Uh-huh.|b
Is she, -|%
I think it's very hard for her, um, to be waited upon, so to speak,|sd
I mean, I think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to.|sd
It's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life, at the level that you did before,|qy
isn't it?|^g
Yeah,|ny
I think that's very true.|aa
Yeah.|b
Um, on the other hand, it takes on almost a, a switch of a mother child relationship.|sv
It is different.|sv
Uh.|b
I had that almost similar situation.|sd
My mother lives in an apartment with my sister --|sd
Oh.|b
-- and, uh, so I, except for the three or four months this summer, -|sd
that's the only time I ever spent with my mother,|sd
and, of course, since I see her only once or twice a year, I was just thrilled --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I spent every minute I could to be with her and, uh, cooking foods for her, you know, just to make her, her life as though she were on vacation.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But somehow another, it, that doesn't work between my mom and my sister,|sd
and they, they find they, they are, -|sd
in speaking they, -|%
I don't know,|h
my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister,|sd
and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I guess it's just because they're there all the time.|sv
Yeah.|b
So it's, it puts, has put pressure on both of them from that point of view.|sd
So that's, that's kind of bad news.|ba
And by the same token, my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home,|sd
and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years --|sd
Um.|b
-- and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm, into another home where the environment is totally different.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
She's relatively happy,|sd
but she doesn't like the food.|sd
And when she complains about the food --|sd
Huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So, that's another one of those things you have to solve.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well, that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's, as you say, lived on a farm for sixty years,|sv
and then go to something like that.|sv
Yeah,|aa
after all, their, their life is so totally different|sv
because in those early days, the food, they had to make it from scratch, so to speak.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, you raised your own chickens,|sd
and you killed your own hogs, I suppose,|sd
and then they --|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't want to say barns,|sd
but they had regular little places they, they would hang it, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, and now, all of a sudden, it, uh, comes in differently,|sd
it tastes differently.|sd
That's right.|aa
Yeah.|b
I'm ready|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Why don't you go ahead and start off|ad
Okay,|aa
well, I don't have an elderly person that I could send to a, a nursing home or anything.|sd
My, both of my parents are dead,|sd
but I did have a friend that was in a convalescent home, uh, like a nursing home|sd
and I h-, went there very often to visit her and, uh, made me feel really sad.|sd
If I did have a mother living, I don't think I could do that.|sd
I think they would be better off being at home with their family, you know.|sv
I agree, although, we're in that situation right now.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
We have a, an eighty seven year old mother in law living with me right now --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently.|sd
And even moving from her house to our house --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we have several young children --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they about drive her crazy.|sd
Oh, I can believe that.|ba
Yes,|%
because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that.|sv
In a situation like that maybe it would be better.|sv
Well, we've, you know, we've struggled a lot with it because, again, most of the nursing homes I've been in are very depressing to me.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And she's still alert enough that I think she would really know that we were putting her there --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
-- and I think she would really resent it,|sd
and I think that would make it very hard.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, on the other hand, I see my wife with, -|sd
I guess our youngest one now is five --|sd
Oh.|b
-- and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot take care of herself. -|sd
She needs to be --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh --|b
-- see, now that's, that's, that's really a sad situation.|sv
And so the drain on the family. -|sv
Yeah,|aa
really, you know.|aa
And when the kids have kids come, you know, she's always saying, you know, why do they have to be here,|sd
why can't they send them home,|^q
it's too noisy|^q
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
right,|b
right.|b
So it's a hard situation, either way, I think.|sv
Yeah,|aa
in a case like that, you know, you more or less think it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where, -|sv
I think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with.|sd
When does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that --|qh
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
and, -|%
Uh-huh,|aa
but the cost of these nursing homes are so,|sv
Oh, prohibitive.|^2
a lot of people can't afford that.|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, so you really have no choice that way if you, you know, if you're not rich or s-, you know.|sv
Uh, I know this lady that, you know, that was a friend of mine,|sd
now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there, you know,|sd
and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, -|%
I think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think if we could send her someplace for the day --|sv
Yeah,|b
then bring her back home at night.|^2
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
Yeah,|aa
you know, just come home for dinner|sv
and then usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow.|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that|sv
but, -|%
But there's not many of those available right now --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- and they're very hard to get them into|sv
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in, she can't participate in.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh,|b
um.|b
But I think it's an issue that, you know, -|sv
with the graying of America, we're really going to have to, as a, as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Because it is a difficult situation|sv
and, you know, you hate seeing them just, sort of send off and not well cared for.|sv
Yeah,|aa
if --|sv
And yet, -|%
But if they, they have their wits about them and everything, why, it's kind of hard|sv
And then I think it depends on their physical ability, too, you know,|sv
if they could be up and doing some things --|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
Well, uh, my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that|sd
and, uh, luckily, I mean, she lived by herself|sd
and then, you know, one day she had a heart attack|sd
and she was gone,|sd
so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that,|sd
but there's, so many of us kids, there was like seven of us that, my, we wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, she could have taken turns living with each one of us, you know, for a sh-, a sh-, a period of time because we all don't live in the same city anyhow, o-, nor the same state|sd
so, -|%
Do you live at all close to each other?|qy
Uh, I, I have a couple more that live out here in California,|no
but then I have a broth-, -|sd
So, how do you feel about the metric system?|qo
Oh, I like it.|sd
I, I, I have a foreign, actually I have more than one foreign automobile.|sd
And I, I, I find the, uh, I find the, the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters, -|sd
I was trying to build a shed|sd
and they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches|sd
and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths, uh ...|sd
Yeah,|b
and it's, -|%
I forget how many millimeters.|sd
So you used the metric?|qy
Well, no.|nn
What we did was wind up using, -|sd
and you just go, you just go down|sd
and, and you get out the, the, so many inches|sd
and, and we just marked a little bit less than that, uh, which is somewhat awkward|sd
but had it been millimeters, you could have done. -|sd
I think what's interesting, -|%
the way engineering people do is they, -|sd
they, in essence, have gotten around it by, by listing, uh, decimal inches.|sd
Uh, yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Do you-, are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that?|qy
Uh, yeah,|ny
yeah.|ny
Uh, I work in metal fab|sd
and tenths of inches are, are normal.|sd
And, you know, me-, you know, it is broken up in, you know, the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for, in tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, of an inch.|sd
Well, have, have you, do you, are you involved in any other, uh, metric type things like ... -|qy
Yes,|ny
I am.|sd
I, I have a Suzuki motorcycle|sd
and, and I've had motorcycles, Japanese motorcycles for years and years|sd
and the metric system comes easy to me.|sd
But my ... -|%
I think it's interesting you we-, you know, when yo-, you go out there|sv
and you're looking for a wrench|sv
and you want the next size larger.|sv
I've got, I inherited some, some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds.|sd
Right.|b
Well, now that one's fairly easy, because that's probably slightly under half an inch.|sv
But some of them, like, like, twenty-seven -|sv
and, and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that, that, uh, don't translate.|sd
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
trans-, -|%
yeah.|aa
To go from, from eighths to sixteenths to, uh, thirty seconds and remember where it falls, it ... -|sv
Yeah.|aa
and, and you've got to go over there and try it|sv
and I suppose, you know, I need a larger one.|sv
I need a smaller one.|^q
I mean obviously you can look at it and say well, anyway. -|sv
I think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't, -|sv
I don't know,|h
do you, do you drink adult beverages?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I drink beer.|sd
We-, th-, have you noticed that, um, that a lot of the, um, a lot of ... -|qy
Yeah,|ny
whiskey is in liters.|^2
Yes.|aa
And, and the next, -|%
yeah,|%
point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters,|sd
yeah.|%
It's like a fifth, like fifths of whiskey I thought was always kind of strange.|sd
Yeah.|b
What's a fifth of whiskey?|qh
Yeah.|aa
I, I always wondered about that myself.|sd
It was a marketing ploy.|sv
And, and they had quarts at the same time though.|sd
Yeah.|b
But the idea was, is that by, with five fifths, um, they could, uh, they could, uh, they could sell five|sv
and, and, um, it was simply a ploy to, to get people, you know --|sv
Yeah.|b
it's, uh, I find that interesting.|sv
It's ... -|%
But it's like, you know, the, the, the, the soda and this kind of things coming in --|sd
Liters.|^2
and, um, I, I think it's kind of generational.|sv
Yeah.|b
It, it's, like I say, I work in a machine shop|sd
and, uh, everything's still inches.|sd
Everything's still fractions of inches, or pa-, or tenths --|sd
Yeah.|aa
It's, it's hard to think --|sv
Yes.|aa
it is a mental thing.|sv
It is a conversion thing.|sv
It's like a mill, you know.|sv
We, we do, uh, um, well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill co-, bond wire on --|sd
Right.|b
And well, what's a mill|qh
and ... -|%
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
But what really annoys me is the way we, in the United States, have been converting to metric.|sd
We have a eighty-nine Chevy Blazer.|sd
And before that we had a Horizon. Uh, you know, Plymouth Horizon?|sd
Yeah.|b
And both of them were a mismatch of both American and metric.|sd
Don't you find that interesting? Uh, that they, that that they're doing that, uh, in any field,|qy
for ho-, why, why, why pieces, -|%
could you, could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't.|qy
Uh, okay.|b
The engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
And the starter was Bosch American,|sd
so. -|%
The bolts were, were Eng-, were, were English then.|bf
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
It was, it was annoying.|sd
One, one half of the starter wa-, you know, three bolts on the starter|sd
and two of them were American|sd
and one of them was metric.|sd
Now that's strange.|ba
And, uh, you go from the, uh, water pump up to the radiator|sd
and on the water pump, it was all metric.|sd
And, and on, you know, the factory fittings, you know, the factory, uh --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Essentially they do that though|sv
because if, if you look at General Motors, the size -|sv
and, and, and of course, Ford and Chrysler.|sv
If they all went, if they all went metric, -|%
but in a sense, um, you know, it's like when yo-, a measurement though, when, when you put, uh, you know, one point four three two inches, whe-, when you're milling something, uh --|sv
Yeah.|b
or, or you measu-, or you got your calipers there|sv
and, and you measure, you know,|sv
you mic it to see if it's accurate|sv
and. -|%
Right.|aa
It's it's not a problem either way.|sv
No.|aa
Like I said, my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car.|sd
Yeah.|b
And you go to look at it|sv
and you don't know which set to reach in, American or metric.|sv
Yeah.|b
and, and, you're never quite sure,|sv
well, is that a metric bolt.|^q
You get you a pair of metric pliers, right|qy
Right,|na
right.|na
And you beat on it|qy^d
and a metric hammer|qy^d
It, it can be annoying|sv
and my other con-, concern is, is the American government going to force us to go.|qy^d
Oh, I think, I don't think so.|sv
I, I think that, th-, uh, I think they've now just taken the attitude that, well, if it happens, if it, -|sv
because it, there a lot of things that, that, uh, um, like sports, you know.|sv
It's a hundred meter.|sv
Oh, absolutely.|aa
And, uh, uh, but automobile races -|%
if it, -|%
I don't think they'd ever, -|sv
it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred.|qy^d
They're not going to ... -|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
Yeah.|ny
They're not going to change that to meters.|sd
It will always be.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, and it, I, I don't think it, I don't, you know, I don't think, I don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality, uh, -|sv
you, it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold.|sv
How many ounces of gold, you know.|qw
Twelve.|sd
I was trying, I was trying to figure up gold content on something.|sd
It had, has, uh, gold plated, uh, header.|sd
And, and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce.|sd
Yeah.|b
There's twelve troy ounces to the pound.|sd
Yeah.|b
Now that makes, you know. -|%
Yeah.|b
And, and is that going to change too?|qh
Well, I mean, and, and then there's a metric ton|sd
and then there's a ton.|sd
But what's a metric ton?|qw
Uh, se-, -- -|%
I don't know.|sd
-- I don't remember.|no
I, I read it.|sd
And are we still going to maintain drams for perfume?|qy
Yeah.|ny
And, and then, but then the medicine.|sd
And, and some of these other things|sd
and, and the chemistry in those kinds of areas,|sd
milliliter.|sd
It's all metric all ready.|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
And, and so, um, but, but when you go to order a drink, um, you know. say, they, they, I don't know, it's uh ... -|sd
And what will a shot be?|qw
Will a shot be an ounce?|qy
I don't know.|no
And, and, but, you know, when you go to the store and, and you're trying to figure, you know, well this box is, is, uh, is, is twelve ounces -|sv
and, and this one's, uh, uh, three pounds, um,|^q
and you ... -|%
And the other one's two point one kis,|sv
and, and you're, you're lost.|sv
That's right.|aa
And, and I don't know.|h
I, I think that, I, I think, I think the Federal government is going to, more or less, leave it alone.|sv
I think they've got, I think there are more pressing problems.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
The economy.|sv
Yes.|aa
Uh, what I was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it. Uh,|sd
a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling.|sv
Personal tools to be able to do his job.|sv
Yeah.|aa
But, but are, are the tools that, uh, -|%
if you're cutting, -|%
are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for tha-, for set up?|qy
Uh, tools for set up and for measurement.|sd
Uh, you got to have a one tenth indicator,|sv
it's a hundred dollars. Uh,|sv
five tenths indic-, uh, usually two one tenth indicators --|sv
Huh.|b
five tenths indicator at about a hundred dollars.|sv
You got to have, uh, six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars.|sv
You got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars. Uh,|sv
one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars.|sv
A two to three for eighty dollars.|sv
A three to four for eighty dollars.|sv
So you've got thousands of dollars or so.|bf
I mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools.|bf
Real fast.|aa
Yes.|b
Real, real fast.|aa
Edge finders and ... -|%
But I was thinking about though that, that when you actually get to the milling equipment though, when it starts turning ... -|%
Well, I know,|aa
because, okay.|%
Your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know.|qh
But whe-, you, when you, when you simply drilling a hole, I mean, a real simple thing, like gee, -|sv
I need a hole there.|^q
What size hole?|qh
Yeah.|b
As in metric size hole or a, or an American sized hole?|qh
Yeah.|aa
And, and what, but the thing is then you've got to with screws|sv
and that's the other issue. Uh,|sv
the pitch and ... -|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Well and thread,|sv
Uh, I don't go to the movies a whole lot,|sd
but, uh, I went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw DANCES WITH WOLVES, which turned out to be an extremely good movie.|sd
I haven't seen that yet.|sd
I, I, I hear, -|%
we, a whole bunch of us were going to go see it.|sd
It's playing at school actually in about two weeks, I guess.|sd
So we're going to go see that.|sd
But you enjoyed that?|qy
Yeah,|ny
it's, it's something that, uh, -|sd
my brother lives over in Fort Worth,|sd
and I was telling him about a couple of weeks ago,|sd
and he said, Well I'll wait until it comes out on, uh, tape and rent, rent the video.|sd
And I said, no,|sd
this is not one that you want to do that with.|^q
That's what I heard,|sd
yeah.|%
It's, uh, the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen.|sd
It's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing,|sd
it's just, uh, just amazing, amazing picture.|sd
Yeah,|b
I've heard it, it, it's not one for the videos.|sd
No,|aa
it's one I think, -|%
but, you know, every now and then you find one that you say, yeah,|sv
this is my favorite movie.|^q
Well, this is the one for me this time.|sd
Really.|bh
Yeah.|ny
What have you been to lately?|qw
Um, let's see.|^h
Well, uh, this is almost, sort of funny.|sd
I was just sit-, um, -|sd
friend and I went to see OUT FOR JUSTICE --|sd
Yeah.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
So we wanted to see what this is like.|sd
And, uh, impressed with actually.|sd
Is that right?|bh
Yeah,|ny
I wasn't, I mean, I've seen his other movies,|sd
and I just think he's pretty good.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, uh, this movie, -|%
I'm convinced now he can act.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
How's his karate?|qw
Oh, his, his, his karate is pretty good.|sd
I think in this one it wasn't so good.|sv
I generally, um, -|%
movies like that scare me, though.|sd
I'd be just fine without them, because, you know, kids come running out wanting to beat each other up.|sv
Well, well they do,|aa
they get -- -|sv
Fighting.|^2
-- I remember when we used to go to see, well I remember when GRAND PRIX came out when I was a kid, and some other movies like that.|sd
We wanted to jump in the cars and race.|sd
Right.|b
And I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it.|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah,|aa
well, that, that was number one for the week actually, too,|sd
so, so it was a little bit, uh, -|%
I was thinking, Wow,|sd
people must be into crime movies again.|^q
But, but in the middle of that conversation we sort or picked an, um, an interesting point.|sd
Last year's number one movie for the year was GHOSTS.|sd
Is that right?|bh
I don't know if you saw GHOSTS or not.|qy^d
I did see GHOSTS.|na
Yeah,|b
and, and, and that was, that, that helped us sort of feel good about, you know, about ourselves and about one around us, in that at least, at least, if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that, at least they're still going to see the real good movies, you know.|sd
Yeah.|b
I think that GHOSTS was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good.|sv
Yeah.|b
And it turned out to be an excellent movie.|sv
Yeah.|aa
It was, it, I was absolutely enthralled by it.|sd
I've forgotten the guy's name who was in it, who had the lead role.|sd
Oh, Patrick Swayze?|qy
Yeah,|ny
and I especially like him.|sd
Yeah,|b
he's very good.|sv
He's a really good guy.|aa
Other than that, DANCES WITH WOLVES seems like to be the only thing I've seen in the past several months to have any, -|sd
Really,|b
I'm trying to think what else I've seen recently.|sd
What else have we seen recently.|t1
Oh, you know, what's pretty cute actually. Um,|qh
DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.|sd
Is that right.|bh
Have you heard of it?|qy
I've, I've seen the ads for it,|na
but I'm not real sure what it's about.|sd
Yeah, um,|b
I actually hadn't heard anything about it,|sd
and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie,|sd
and, and they said it starred, um, Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks,|sd
at first they told me.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I thought, what a strange combination,|sd
Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep.|^q
That is a strange combination.|aa
Well, actually, it starred, that, that it's actually Albert Brooks,|sd
so it's lot better.|sv
Mel Brooks you probably know.|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
I know,|bk
so it, it was a strange combination.|sv
But it turned out to be a very cute movie.|sd
I mean, the whole premise is that they go out|sd
and, and they die --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
-- and they have to, -|sd
Both of them.|qy^d
Right.|na
Both of them are dead,|sd
and they happen to meet in this, this town, um, this, this sort of city where you're set up.|sd
You know, they go|sd
and they decide if you can move up to the next level.|sd
Oh.|b
I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull,|qy^d
but --|sd
Yeah,|ny
years ago.|sd
They sort of move up to levels,|sd
and, and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough,|sd
and as it turns out, you know, they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that.|sd
Oh.|b
So you can guess the rest of the plot.|ad
It actually, it's, it's really funny because they run through, you know, what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
And then defend it.|qy^d
And that's pretty good actually.|sd
Well, I guess that's where the title comes from then.|qy^d
Yeah.|ny
And it's|sd
you actually have to go up there|sd
and you have a, they have an attorney for, you know, attorney for you and attorney,|sd
a defense and a prosecution,|sd
and you know, the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level,|sd
and the defense's job is to make sure that you, you do, you know.|sd
It's, uh, it's a neat little story actually.|sd
Yeah,|aa
it is.|aa
I was, I was, I went thinking it'll be okay, not great,|sd
and then I actually came away thinking it was really pretty good.|sd
So, -|%
It's funny,|ba
we've got a couple of movies out recently, GHOSTS and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, that have to do with, uh, after life, I guess.|sd
Yeah.|b
And it kind of makes you wonder,|sv
I'm also, besides working at T I, I'm a graduate student at North Texas and working on master's in communication.|sd
It's the behavioral science part of communication,|sd
and I think about these things and people trying to define their own world view,|sd
and, uh --|qh
Um.|b
or why are we so fascinated with the other world.|qh
Is it supposed to be better?|qh
The other world,|b
yeah.|%
Sometimes I think we think it is.|sv
We like those things that way.|sv
Um, I'm, I'm sure that it seems like, -|%
it certainly would, would explain the preoccupation with ,|sv
but I suspect it's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things.|sv
Well, it has.|aa
All the way through history, there's, I guess, -|sv
if you want to call its mysticism or the occult or whatever. It's always fascinated.|sv
I guess because we don't know,|sv
and there's no real way of finding out.|sv
Right,|aa
well. -|%
There's only one way of finding it.|sv
Well did you ever see, um, FLATLINERS.|qy
No,|nn
I did, uh, did not.|sd
The girl next to me saw it,|sd
and she really liked it.|sd
That's, that's, that's probably one of those ones that, you know, -|%
it's on video now, I think.|sd
Yeah,|aa
it is.|aa
Probably, probably worth seeing on video.|sv
Actually we really enjoyed it,|sd
but it was also right along the same lines.|sd
I mean --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
they said, she said that this was almost believable|sd
that could really happen.|sd
You know, you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things,|sv
and you never know.|sv
Almost,|aa
yeah,|aa
I, I, it's a little far fetched to,|sv
but --|sd
Yeah.|b
and they didn't just sort of make it silly.|sd
It was, you know, it was done fairly well, I think.|sd
So. Actually, I actually enjoyed that as well.|sd
Yeah.|b
I like it when they will do something and not get too silly.|sd
I've been disappointed in some movies that, they don't know how to end it, it seems like,|sd
so then they get crazy|sd
and, and it doesn't end like the story has been going.|sd
The story sort of keeps going and going.|aa
Well I guess that covers our topic.|fc
Yeah,|fc
great.|fc
Well, it was, n-, nice talking to you.|fc
Nice talking to you.|fc
Bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Are you ready to start?|qy
Yes.|ny
Okay|bk
Have you recently bought a new car Catherine?|qy
Well, I just found out that my car like an old was thirty months old,|arp_nd
and it doesn't seem like it's that old.|sd
Oh.|bk
Seems like I just bought it.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
It's an eighty-nine|sd
and I bought it, uh, in, uh, eighty-eight|sd
so, yeah.|%
Well, I really, I-, the last car we got was a, was a used car.|sd
I really don't prefer buying a new car.|sd
I like to let somebody else pay for that|sd
I know,|aa
I really will do that the next time,|sd
But, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we bought it for very functional purposes,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and that was we bought a station wagon.|sd
We wanted an economical car --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment.|sd
So, we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I've never been sorry,|sd
Oh, that's wonderful.|ba
however the need for that --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, okay.|b
and, uh, while it is still good,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Huh.|b
And probably then some|sd
I'll spend a lot of time praying over it before I give it up.|sd
Sure.|b
I think that I would like to, -|sd
if I-, you know, we all say, if I could have the car I always wanted --|sd
Right.|b
I'm sold on Nissans.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I a or, or foreign cars actually.|sd
Uh,|%
But do you feel though, uh, craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities?|qy
Uh,|^h
Is that how you, -|qy
I have never, -|%
its reliability.|qy
Its re-, -|%
Its reliability.|sd
And, uh, I, you know, I've read all the CONSUMER REPORTS and things,|sd
and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars.|sd
If Ford was a head and the shoulders above it, I'd buy a Ford.|sd
Isn't that a shame.|bh
But I had, uh, had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it.|sd
My word isn't that sorry.|bh
That's sorry.|ba
Uh, you know, I mean it was ready for the graveyard.|sd
My word.|ba
And I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car.|sd
Oh, mercy.|ba
So, -|%
You, -|%
and that was just trying to hold us,|sd
getting out of that was a used car.|sd
Huh.|b
And it was an older car,|sd
Huh.|b
but, you know, Escort is supposed to have a great track record --|sv
Huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But it's just, it just was not deliv-, -|sd
and you get stung a time or two,|sv
Sure.|aa
and you say, no thanks.|sv
No thanks.|b^m
That's right.|aa
So, I just trusted the CONSUMER REPORTS and the auto,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
had my son who knows a lot about that, study them thoroughly,|sd
and he gave me four choices of cars to buy|sd
Uh-huh.|b
An Escort definitely was not among them.|sd
In fact, there wasn't an American car in there.|sd
Wow.|ba
Uh, the Nissan came|sd
and, and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the CONSUMER REPORTS said we should get.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But it served our needs.|sd
Uh, later on his reports, the reports that he studied showed that, uh, Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the area-, in the class that we were looking for.|sd
And that, and I'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac.|sd
I really would.|sd
It's not necessarily prestige,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but it's comfort.|sv
Uh, there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car.|sv
Uh,|%
Who makes that car?|qw
Nissan.|sd
M-, -|%
I mean but where are they, where are they,|qw
what, what is their location,|qw
is it, uh, Asian|qy
or is it European|qrr
or who, -|%
No.|nn
No,|nn
no.|nn
Nissan is Japanese.|sd
Oh, it is Japanese.|bh
Uh-huh,|ny
uh-huh,|ny
Okay,|bk
uh-huh.|b
I didn't know.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, if I couldn't have my luxury Maxima --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Okay|b
I mean, you know, every othe-, every one of us have two sides|sv
Yeah,|aa
I guess so|aa
that's true.|aa
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|b^m
Now what about you,|qo
if you could have the car that you wanted --|qw
If, if,|^h
and why?|qw
Gee.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Probably, um, uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
See there, -|%
But I, I don't know the performance of it.|sd
That's a,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and, you know,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I tell you that's sad too because there one time Ford was the best,|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Really was.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I, I really have not seen, -|sd
now a lot of the American cars actually are, are, parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa.|sv
Can I put you on hold for one minute?|ad
Of course.|aa
Thank you.|ft
Well, that was one minute.|sd
They hung up.|sd
Okay|b
Uh, at any rate do you have color preferences|qy
or what would be the features that you would be looking for?|qrr
Um, well, the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, now color preferences,|sd
I think I would opt to go with a bronze.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Oh, wow.|ba
We like the stuff that glitters|bf
Yeah.|aa
Good.|ba
There's nothing wrong with that.|sv
Actually I think probably if I were going to get a-, if I were going to be practical, which doesn't mean I would be,|sv
Right,|b
well, practical|%
yes|%
that's, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Right|aa
and it's cooler I believe,|sv
And, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|aa
Now the interior,|sd
okay,|%
I don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
But if I had the little red C R X ,|sd
and I'd have to live with that.|sd
And if I got the C R X it would have to have a real good sound system in it because I'd want that too.|sd
Oh.|b
I'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind|sd
Um, can you, uh, hang on again hon-,|ad
Uh-huh.|aa
Thanks|ft
I've got the phones for lunch hour.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So. -|%
Just don't mind me if I bounce back and forth.|ad
That's okay.|bd
Um, so you like to listen to, uh, a lot of music,|qy^d
or do, is it talk shows.|qrr
No,|nn
no,|nn
no.|nn
I generally would p-, uh, prefer to listen to, uh, well, I listen to K C B I a lot|sd
but I will listen to the news and the, and the traffic and those things at work.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
But if I'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I love classical music,|sd
and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the,|sv
All the, -|%
yeah.|%
Uh-huh.|aa
That's true.|aa
So I do love classical music|sd
or it li-, or, or, uh,|sd
Do you listen t-,|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Huh.|b
Sure do.|sd
Yeah.|b
W R R and the Oasis are the two that I listen to,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And I do like them.|sd
And I'd like to have a compact disc player in the car.|sd
That would be,|sd
Those are nice, aren't they?|qy
Yes,|ny
those are nice.|sv
Those compact discs,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
they don't warp.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, there's nothing in there that can wrap around the, the, uh, rollers or anything.|sd
It seems like a really good answer to portable music,|sv
Huh.|b
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Okay,|b^m
I, I do a fair amount of cooking.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, and I love having guests to dinner.|sd
I probably do that about once a month.|sd
And, uh, I usually prepare something, depending upon the guests, you know,|sd
it, it, I like to prepare chicken, that seems to please everybody, pasta or a casserole.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
How about you?|qo
Yeah,|b
those are things I like the most.|sd
I like fish and chicken the most.|sd
Um.|b
And, uh, most of the cooking I do just comes out of a can.|sd
Uh.|b
Unless it is, unless it is, I catch a fish and I prepare it.|sd
And then I just, uh, you know, I just broil it and put lemon on it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, that's about the way I prepare most fish.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I made scallops the other night,|sd
that was unusual,|sd
and, uh, basically, uh, I found a recipe to make it in the microwave|sd
and you sprinkled, uh, you swished around a little melted butter and do, uh, oh I do not know, micro-, microwaved them for about nine minutes.|sd
No,|ar
no,|ar
four and a half to five minutes|sd
and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top,|sd
very simple, but very nice.|sd
So, if you are looking for a French recipe, that was good.|sd
Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.|b
Sesame seeds and bread crumbs.|b^m
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, my husband liked it.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, no|b
unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive, uh, fish items.|sv
Right,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
But, you know, I, I look for them to go on sale at the grocery store|sd
Uh, one of the things I love to do, eat out.|sd
How about you?|qo
Oh, yeah,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
Do you have any particular places you like going?|qy
Oh, there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central.|na
Uh-huh.|b
I like that,|sd
it's just, it's just home cooking.|sd
Yes.|b
I have been there.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, it's kind of, kind of like Black Eye Pea,|sd
but I do not think it's a chain.|sd
Right,|aa
exactly,|aa
uh-huh,|aa
and that's, that's the other restaurant Black Eye Pea.|sd
Oh.|b
So, I do not really like, uh, you know, uh, uh, chili places or, what is it, Judge Roy Bean's,|sd
or --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
I, I do not feel like they are very healthy,|sv
and I always,|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, I tend to have chicken fried steak when I go, go to them.|sd
Right,|b
and I, and I got, uh, chicken marinara the last two times.|sd
Oh, how was it?|qw
It was, uh, it was great.|sd
Um.|b
Because that's, that's what I like,|sd
I do not like it, you know. I just like a baked, you know, a piece of chicken|sd
and then I get like green beans and mashed potatoes.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know.|qh
Yeah.|b
I, I tend to, uh, I get teased by my family a lot, because, uh, I like experimenting on, on food|sd
and sometimes I go for ex-, fairly exotic things.|sd
And my father teases me about gourmet cooking.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else, is that some of the experiments fail.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
Uh, the last time we had some, uh, friends over for dinner, I tried a dessert that sounded wonder-, wonderful in the recipe|sd
and it was just a total bust.|sd
I was,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
My, uh, my brother tried to make, uh, a bunch of things, uh, way back.|sd
He tried to make bagels one time.|sd
Oh my that's ambitious.|ba
Yeah,|aa
and, uh, we took some|sd
and then we had, uh, German Shepherds at the time,|sd
and we took some and gave it to the dogs,|sd
and the dog never, you know, he treated it like a milk bone|sd
and he never did finish it.|sd
Um.|b
He just barely made a dent in it.|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh, and, uh, then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's, uh, supposed to be candy.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, uh, it, it did not turn out very well,|sd
it was, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so, uh. -|%
Huh, see I am not, -|%
that's interesting.|ba
One of the things I do not make is dessert.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation, because, uh, you know, we have ice cream, or something like that.|sd
And that's why when I took, did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Huh.|b
Uh, everything else was fine,|sd
but that was a fiasco.|sd
Well, you have to put eggs and everything, don't you.|qy
Or, -|%
Uh, yeah.|ny
Yeah,|b^m
just about.|sv
Yeah.|b
And I, I also don't have much of a sweet tooth,|sd
so I can live without, live without dessert for the most part.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Use about half the sugar,|ad
or make everything diet.|ad
Yeah.|aa
Uh, do you cook for yourself|qy
or do you cook for others?|qrr
Mostly, I just cook for myself.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, when I was single, I used to, uh, I think my favorite meal was a, a baked potato.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, -|%
It's easy,|sv
that's for sure.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
Yeah.|b^m
Oh, yeah.|aa
And, I mean, I never put anything other than a little butter on it,|sd
if I had, or if I had a little cheddar cheese, sometimes I would grate that up.|sd
Yeah,|b
I always put cheese on them.|sd
And, uh, it's amazingly satisfying.|sv
Uh-huh.|aa
Yeah,|aa
but, you know, there's hardly any, I guess there's hardly any protein,|sv
it's mostly starch.|sv
So, it fills you up|sv
and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I did-, I did not say it was nourishing,|sd
but it was satisfying.|sd
Oh, yeah,|aa
it really is.|aa
And, -|%
Then you have to make a salad|sv
or, -|%
Yeah,|aa
yeah|aa
tha-, but, you know, I never really enjoyed cooking for myself,|sd
so I ate very simply.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I was, that's why, I think that's one reason I like having people over, because I could try things.|sd
I mean, I must be a frustrated chemist or something like that.|sd
Right.|b
Cause cooking is a little bit like, like being in a chemistry lab.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, -|%
Except you get to taste the product instead .|sv
Yes,|aa
and have an explosion.|sv
Fill them up|sv
or blow up.|sv
Sometimes it blows up anyway.|sv
Yeah.|aa
I, I once had a, an old boy friend over to, to dinner when I was recently staying with my parents.|sd
And, uh, I had this wonderful recipe|sd
and you were supposed to make a, a toffee like substance for a pie by, uh, boiling evaporated milk three hours,|sd
and it does turn to toffee inside the can.|sd
Oh, yeah|b
And, uh, the only problem was, when I opened the can, it just flew all over the place.|sd
It was on the ceiling, on the walls and me.|sd
And, and the boy friend thought, -|sd
it was, he was supposed to be there at six o'clock, not seven o'clock,|sd
so just at the time all this happened, the door bell rang|sd
and there he was.|sd
And I had to have my, my, my, my dad sort of entertain him for a, for|sd
Right.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Did you let the can cool off?|qy
Uh, I really do not remember,|no
that was about ten years ago,|sd
I just remember how embarrassing it was.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I have made, I have made it since, I've, I, and several times before|sd
and I never had that problem,|sd
just that one time.|sd
Huh. Yeah.|b
And, uh, he, he was a gourmet cook,|sd
he was kind of pushy too.|sd
Acted like, he came from San Francisco|sd
and he had a very sophisticated taste.|sd
I, I really wanted to impress the heck out of him|sd
and, and well, it was a memorable evening anyway.|sd
Right.|b
Uh, as far as, -|%
I, I do enjoy cooking|sd
so, I was awfully glad I was given this, -|sd
Are you ready?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
She didn't announce that to you?|qy
Oh, I didn't, I didn't quite hear all of it.|arp_nd
Oh, I see.|bk
That's fine.|ba
Um, I think, uh, that's pleasurable for all of us, if we choose the right restaurant|sv
Right|b
So, what are your thoughts on dining out?|qw
Well, I, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.|sd
Not for the price?|qy^d
Well, a little bit --|na
Okay.|bk
but, uh, I think that as far as quality of food goes the m-, some of the most expensive places I've been --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
The be-, -|%
Really?|bh
Okay.|bk
Really.|na
Um, a lot of places that even don't look, don't look like much.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Some of the, some of the best food I have ever had was out of a, outside or inside of a place that we drove up|sd
and I was like, I'm not eating in there|sd
Are you nuts?|^q
And, uh, we went in|sd
and it was the m-, it was the most wonderful food.|sd
My word,|ba
it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh?|qy
Yeah.|qy
Oh.|bk
I'm serious.|sd
Yeah.|b
Um, a lot of, uh, one place that we went just recently --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
No,|ar
that's not right.|ar
That's not right.|ar
That's not right.|ar
Okay.|b
someone in the What's the name of that restaurant?|t3
in the background Where at? .|t3
someone in the background The Hari Krishna.|t3
in the background relies Oh. Kalachandji's .|t3
Kalachandji's.|sd
It's all vegetarian,|sd
and it, it was just fabulous.|sd
I mean, my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and liked it.|sd
Wow.|ba
And where was that at, near your, -|qw
Um, Kalachandji's.|sd
It's, uh, it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant.|sd
Where,|qw
is it in Dallas?|qy
Yes.|ny
Is it in the phone book?|qy
Uh, I think so.|na
It should be.|sd
Do you know how to spell it?|qy
Uh, it starts with a K.|sd
Okay.|bk
So|sd
Kalli , K A L L I?|qy
Okay.|bk
That should get you close enough to, to be able to find it.|sd
I think it's, uh, probably listed in the restaurants, you know.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
section,|b
yes,|b
uh-huh.|b
But it's, uh, it's just fabulous food.|sd
What about fast foods?|qo
Do you have a preference if you were going to,|qy
Well, we like Arby's.|na
You do,|bh
See I don't like Arby's.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Why?|qw
No,|nn
because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever.|sv
They use the, they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver|sv
and they, they form it,|sv
and they make it look like roast beef,|sv
and I said, no,|sd
thank you.|^q
Oh, no,|ar
no,|ar
no.|ar
Someone has been lying to you.|sv
What they use is roast beef.|sv
Well, that's not what I heard,|sd
That's what, -|%
Oh, my goodness.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
I'm surprised.|sd
My dad worked for Arby's for several years.|sd
Really?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Unless somebody is trying to blackball them.|sv
Well, that's happened before.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But we like good s-, uh, w-, we're, we like Mexican food.|sd
Okay.|bk
And stuff like that.|sd
And so, um, -|%
How about the health food, uh, restaurants? Well, like this one|qo
but it's probably not advertised as such, is it?|qy
Or, -|%
A health food?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Health food, uh, restaurants that, -|sd
Like, like, -|%
name one|ad
Well --|aa
I'm not sure what you're talking about.|sd
But they ought, there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious. You know, as far as their cholesterol levels and their, their fat content and, you know, the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product|sd
and they list them.|sd
Now there's one restaurant that does that|sd
and it's called Rodolfo's|sd
over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe.|sd
Huh.|b
And they r-, have very good food over there.|sd
I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that|sd
so,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
They do list, um, you know, list the fat,|sd
It would be good I think,|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
uh, I don't know how expensive they are.|qw^d
It sounds like that it would probably, -|sv
Well, it was pretty reasonable.|sv
I, it was around ten dollars for lunch. Okay,|sd
wha-, which is kind of high for lunch I guess.|sv
For one person?|qy
Yes.|ny
Oh|bk
Yes,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
A bit|sv
Yeah.|aa
Uh, but,|sd
Yeah,|b
I, I won't really be interested in going to, in going there.|sd
Well,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I guess if you were having, if you were trying to impress somebody w-, like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Maybe,|aa
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|%
Yeah.|aa
I could see that,|aa
Uh-huh.|b
And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I like the,|sd
Because they're, -|%
Well, they have lunch specials that -|%
you can't, you can't beat that price, uh, if you went to a cafeteria.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Probably that's true.|aa
But I know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things,|sv
Well, I had the,|sd
and it was excellent.|sd
It was a marinated, broiled chicken breast|sd
and it was exce-, -|sd
Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?|qw
Oh, it was,|sd
That's one of my husband's pet peeves.|sd
He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.|sd
Well, I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north|sd
and that was a no no.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
And I haven't gotten over that from the north.|sd
Oh, catfish is wonderful.|sv
I know they say that,|sd
Oh, really.|b
but I'm,|sd
Really.|b
and so I kind of stay a-, -|sd
Why?|qw
Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the,|sv
Oh.|bk
Huh.|b
I-, and especially, uh, in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.|sd
That's too bad,|sd
I, -|%
Well, yeah.|b
So yo-, I am,|%
and the, the best brand of chicken to buy is the, uh, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , uh, unnatural growth in their products.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
So I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.|sv
That's true.|aa
So I'm, I, you know, I, -|%
Oh, on one hand I see that|sd
and on the other hand, uh, my older sister --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Corrode.|^2
Huh.|b
So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then they take these things that will rust|sd
and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.|sd
Well, I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good.|sd
Oh.|b
And then they wouldn't think.|sd
They were floating around|sd
so they shot holes in them to sink them.|sd
Oh, dear.|ba
And this is before I was born.|sd
Wow.|ba
So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago,|sd
Sure.|b
Yeah.|b
and, and who's, you know, the tuna is radioactive --|sv
That's right.|aa
Everything we eat.|sv
Everything,|sv
You can't get away from it|sv
so I think,|%
Yeah.|b
yeah,|b^m
you know. So there's, you know, there's some things I think we can av-, we, you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, you know, -|sv
this is not in my control.|sv
Well, you know, -|%
So I'm either going to be, I'm either going to starve to death|sv
or I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can, you know.|sv
Well, Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs,|sv
Do you use credit cards a good bit?|qy
I do,|na
and I wish I didn't|sd
Uh.|b
Before I got married, uh, about the only credit cards I used were gas cards, because I didn't like carrying, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but I just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
In fact, I remember getting my first MasterCard,|sd
and the only reason I got it was, you know, there was a while --|sd
Okay.|b
Absolutely.|b
Right.|b
And so that's why I went ahead and got one.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It was a mistake|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, actually, I, I have a whole wallet full of credit cards.|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't use them very often.|sd
Um, oh, I may use, I try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week, and try to use a different one, so that, you know, I have, keep those active.|sd
Yeah.|b
I have a half a dozen department store credit cards,|sd
and I, I'll use those if I need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick --|sd
Yeah.|b
just enough to keep them active.|sd
My biggies are the VISA, MasterCard and Discover.|sd
Yeah.|b
And for the most part, I had used those for like, uh, charging airline tickets, where I can pay for those, you know, you could --|sd
Yeah.|b
or I fly Southwest a good little bit, which means I can just run that card through the machine.|sd
That's right.|aa
Uh, and it saves a lot time.|sd
And that's what I was using it for.|sd
However, we had a, had a, a very pressing financial family crisis, which said you have no alternative,|sd
you must have the money to do this with,|^q
and you do not have any other options --|^q
Uh-huh.|b
-- so I charged all three of those cards up,|sd
and right now I am paying and praying.|sd
I know how that goes --|ba
But, uh, -|%
-- and that's exactly what we've, I mean --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- we had no way around it --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and the only way to do it is go get, you know, an advance --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh|b
-- and so like you were paying for it,|sd
but --|sd
Well, I never did,|sd
I never did use it for an advance.|sd
Most of my charges were, uh, medications.|sd
Oh, I see.|b
Didn't have cash for the medications|sd
or it was, uh, the doctor would accept MasterCard or VISA.|sd
Oh.|b
And, uh,|sv
different labs will --|sv
What, -|%
Do you find now, though, that even some doctors won't?|qy
I've found some doctors that say, you know, -|^h
I was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards,|^h
and so many of them don't anymore.|na
Uh-huh|b
So, -|%
Well, I have not, -|%
like I said, that was just one period in my life where that was critical.|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't generally charge.|sd
I say well, I need a checkup in six months,|sd
and I kind of set that aside --|sd
Right.|b
I'm reimbursed on insurance anyway,|sd
and I can handle, you know, paying for it and waiting two or three weeks.|sd
Right.|b
Getting into a credit card fiasco is easy.|sv
Oh, it is|aa
It is easy,|sv
and it's very difficult to get out.|sv
I just cringe every month when I see those interest charges.|sd
I know.|aa
I say wow,|sd
I, I ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off.|^q
Big deal,|^q
I'm saving two percent.|^q
Right.|b
But, you know, the interest, even though it bothered me, it didn't used to bother me so much, because, of course, you could list it on a Schedule A|sd
and you got all your interest, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it.|sv
Right.|b
And but it, but it is easy to get into a credit card problem,|sv
and I, I think about young people that think, you know, -|sv
there's kind of that feeling of hey, it's so neat,|sv
I have my first credit card --|^q
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments.|sd
Oh, yeah,|aa
and --|sv
You know.|qh
it's --|sv
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
Uh, you send in, uh, uh, fifty dollars,|sv
you're going to pay twenty, twenty-five in interest charges.|sv
That's right.|aa
You only get half of that paid for the principal,|sv
so I'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts.|sd
Right.|b
Now, as the monthly payment, uh, I mean as the monthly payment amount goes down, that will free up more cash where I can continue to make the larger payments.|sd
Right.|b
Uh, as long as I don't have a major disaster where I have to use it again, I can, I can do that.|sd
Right.|b
Meantime, though, I'm not building any reserves.|sd
No,|aa
and that's frightening to me.|sv
Anything that I could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards.|sd
That's right.|aa
That's frightening, too.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I, I just, I, my husband is in business for himself --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- I work for T I|sd
but he doesn't --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, we're, uh, I, I've kind of got my fingers cr-, crossed.|sd
I've learned when you're in business for yourself, that, that you don't count on something until it's happened --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but he's got some, you know, it's those once in a lifetime cases,|sd
and after ten years he's got two of them --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they should pay through next month,|sd
and, and we're both just looking at each other every night going man, that will pay off like both of our MasterCards, you know.|sd
Oh, right,|b
right.|b
And, you know, just in one lump,|sd
because that's the only way you can do it, is to have a big chunk of money --|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
-- or it's like you say,|sv
you pay forever.|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
And so I'm really looking forward to that.|sd
Well, you either need a big chunk of money|sv
or you need a large reserve --|sv
That's right.|aa
Now, those are very handy --|sv
Right.|b
-- if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments, sharp, good --|sv
Sure,|aa
yeah.|aa
I agree.|aa
-- because you're living on the other guy's money for a while.|sd
That's right|aa
But I can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money|sd
I know|aa
and, -|%
And it just irks me.|sd
I say my gosh, I had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this,|sd
and I've got three cards.|sd
I've lost a whole day of my life --|sd
I know.|aa
You're like --|sv
Yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
And that just blows my mind.|sd
I, my house is paid for,|sd
my car is paid for,|sd
I've got some home improvements,|sd
but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards.|sd
It's incredible.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Boy, I wish I could say that my house and, -|sd
well, my car is paid for now.|sd
It was wrecked three weeks ago,|sd
but, but you see again --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I had to have the money to pay rental car, pay this, pay that till the insurance company pays back.|sd
That's right.|aa
I think --|sv
And, uh, -|%
Yeah.|b
Because you know that's coming back to pay it off.|sd
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
Uh, I went to a seminar,|sd
they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items.|sd
You only use credit cards for investments.|^q
Right.|b
I said for crying out loud, if I had the money to in-, you know, --|sd
It's, -|%
Sure.|b
That's right.|aa
That doesn't make a bit of sense to me.|sv
I thought --|sd
That's right.|aa
Well, the smart half was don't pay it for consumables,|sv
don't, you know, if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash, don't put it on a credit card --|sv
That's right.|aa
and, and so that, that is the smart half.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, and I can remember before we had kids, we did that a lot,|sd
but it was no biggie --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
while after kids, and you're paying child care and other things, all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off,|sv
so we cut that out real quick|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And, uh, but I, I do like having them there.|sd
There is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis, they are there to use --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- but you have to have a very good sense of saving, and or --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh|b
You also have to have that willingness to commit to that --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Seem to have the topic already on top of th-, tip of your tongue there|sv
so why don't you go ahead and start.|ad
Yeah.|aa
Isn't the, uh, the subject auto repair,|qy
Yes, sir.|ny
Yeah.|%
That's great.|ba
The reason I say that is pretty timely because just tonight I went out and changed the oil in my car|sd
and,|sd
Okay.|b
Right,|aa
exactly.|aa
It's, uh, and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car,|sv
but I do like to get out and tinker with a car|sd
and it's something I can do still.|sd
Do you enjoy working with your car?|qy
I sure do.|na
I, uh, in fact, the last thing I have, I've done I, I don't even remember what it is.|sd
I've had to have oil changes done myself because I live in an apartment complex,|sd
Oh, dear.|ba
We can't even wash our vehicle,|sd
so. -|%
Oh, that's too bad.|ba
Uh, but the last thing I can remember doing wh-, -|sd
I had a sixty-six Mustang,|sd
Oh.|b
and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days, I guess.|sd
Oh, yes.|aa
And, uh, you know, you could do a lot of it yourself still,|sd
and, uh, I didn't tinker too much with the engine.|sd
It was, it was in pretty good shape,|sd
but my main concern and what I enjoy doing was, was the interior.|sd
Oh.|b
And, uh, it was, it was pretty shelled, uh,|sd
but it was fun.|sd
It was taking the whole thing, you know, the whole interior apart and, you know, ordering new carpeting and, uh, -|sd
And did you install all that yourself?|qy
Right.|na
Well, that was,|qy^d
And, -|%
It, it was.|na
I, my wife enjoyed, uh, she, you know, helped out a little.|sd
We sanded down the, the insides of the door panels.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Wow.|ba
Do you still have the car?|qy
No,|nn
I sold it.|sd
Well, that's too bad.|ba
A sixty-seven Chev-, uh, Mustang is about the, uh, top, top year for the Mustang car.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it was fun though.|sd
It was fun.|sd
I, I really enjoyed it,|sd
and I was surprised at, at, uh, the availability of parts yet.|sd
Yes.|b
You know, you can, you can still get factory original parts.|sd
Huh.|%
But, uh, you pay a premium|sd
but you just don't get them.|sd
I, I didn't.|sd
I went ahead and got, you know, Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made,|sd
Canada.|sd
Yeah.|b
You know, prefabs and all that stuff|sd
but, -|%
Well, you know, that's, that's fine.|ba
I, I don't think that there would be, uh, you know, a, a quality difference.|sv
I don't know.|h
You wouldn't, you didn't notice the difference, did you?|qy
Well, actually there was.|arp_nd
Oh.|bk
And, uh, I had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate certain patterns, uh, exactly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so like the, the glove box was just a little,|sd
Oh, dear.|ba
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I had to cut some of the sides down.|sd
Oh, dear.|ba
But just, just little things.|sd
You know, one of the screws on, on the door regulat-, uh, window regulators|sd
you could get three of the, three of the four to lineup.|sd
The fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did.|sd
Oh,|qy
You know, thin-, -|%
Oh, it was|na
but,|sd
and,|sd
Right,|aa
right.|aa
so. -|%
Yeah,|aa
that's, that's true.|aa
Well, you know, that, that is something I really enjoy doing. Um, working on our car too,|sd
the, uh, I just changed my oil, oil tonight|sd
but, uh, I enjoy also working on things like the brakes|sd
and, uh, in fact, just two weeks ago I helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car.|sd
And, uh, either if it's a drum or, or disc brakes, I enjoy working on those kind of things.|sd
Disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem|sd
but I, I honestly don't have the tools for the drum.|sd
I know you got, uh, certain spring lever that you got to have or some, uh --|sd
Yeah.|b
Spoons and, -|^2
Yes,|aa
you do|aa
Uh, my dad has got all that|sd
and, and I, I helped him when I was growing up,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but I don't have that stuff now,|sd
Yeah.|b
because of the drum brakes I, you know, don't have any choice but to take them in.|sd
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
And, you know, it, it doesn't, doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too|sv
because, um, I was helping my neighbor out|sd
and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced|sd
and I don't have, of course, the equipment to do that,|sd
Sure.|b
so he took it into a shop and had it resur-, uh, resurfaced and, and fixed that way.|sd
But, yeah,|%
it is true, uh, you know,|sv
I did have a sixty-four Ford truck that I wish I still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I'll tell you what.|^h
The other, the nicest thing about them is, uh, everything was standard.|sd
You didn't have to worry about finding a metric anything.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Boy, I tell you.|^h
And you know, -|%
So, a-, are you a news person?|qy
Uh, I really am,|na
I enjoy, I enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as I can. Although, you know, I'm a full time student|sd
and I work full time, too,|sd
so, or not full time,|sd
but I work quite a bit|sd
and so --|sd
Yes.|b
I like, I like to listen to national public radio, uh, all things considered.|sd
Yes,|b
great show.|sv
Yeah,|aa
and I like to listen to that and catch, you know, -|sd
I don't get, I don't get a lot of, uh, sometimes I don't get the current events, you know. Because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with, uh, you know, some important issue on the day.|sd
But, -|%
Yeah,|b
so, so the real, the real current news and, the hard news --|bf
Yeah.|aa
Right,|aa
that's right,|aa
yeah.|aa
Yeah,|b^m
I've had, I've had that frustration, too.|sd
I --|sd
Yeah|b
Yeah,|b
you, you li-, you like N P R -s, uh, programming?|qy
Uh, in general.|na
Yeah.|b
Uh, I --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I, I subscribe to three newspapers.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, you know, I sort of can't get enough of this.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, and I, when I travel elsewhere, I'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have.|sd
H-, h-, h-, -|%
Oh, yeah.|b
Oh, yeah.|b
Well, in, in Dallas, what are the, what is the newspaper situation?|qw
Well we d-, we, we have a, a big newspaper situation.|sd
Uh, because, we used to have two newspapers up until, uh, last Sunday|sd
and a, uh, major, uh, a, one of our major papers just closed down.|sd
They closed shop, and said, well, we can't put any more papers out,|sd
we're done.|^q
Was, was that the, the better paper|qy
or , -|%
Yeah,|ny
I thought so.|sd
It was a, it was a more effective paper as far as I was concerned.|sd
It, it had, uh, uh, it got to the news, you know, and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't, I don't like to, you know, I like to save the editorial information or the the politically, uh, weighted information, you know, for the, for a different section.|sd
I like just to get to the, you know, find out what's happening --|sd
Yes.|b
And I feel that the other newspaper, uh, -|%
the T-, the DALLAS MORNING NEWS is the one that's still here.|sd
The TIMES HERALD is the one that closed up|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, the, the MORNING NEWS was, was, i-, is okay,|sv
but, you know, you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as I'm concerned.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, many times it doesn't doesn't reflect my own opinion|sd
and, -|%
But if you, if you were to look at the front page of today's MORNING NEWS --|qy
Uh-huh.|b
No,|nn
no,|nn
that's the problem.|sv
Oh.|bk
But, y-, you know, you see, you see Troy Aikman's knee surgery on the front page, you know.|sv
Whoever Troy Aikman is.|qw^d
Yeah,|b
a, a quarterback for the Broncos or for the, for the Cowboys.|sd
Okay.|bk
Uh, you know, you know, you know what I mean --|qw
Yeah.|ny
-- that, there is, uh, local news that, uh, that really a lot of times doesn't, doesn't change, change my life one way or the other.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, uh, -|%
I guess it's current events, but not the kind of current events that changes the world.|sv
Right,|aa
right,|aa
yeah|aa
Not something you'll, you'll, uh, be interested in ten years from now by any means.|sv
Yeah.|b
How, how about you?|qo
Uh, I guess in Washington, D C you guys have several papers that are pretty --|qy
Yes.|ny
A lot of them.|sd
I, I rather like the WASHINGTON POST.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, I also get the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, and, uh, each of them covers different things in, in dif-, dif-, --|sv
Right.|b
and so it's, you know, if I only looked at one of them I would have a different perspect-, clearly would have a different perspective on the world.|sv
Right,|aa
yeah.|aa
Uh, I, I have a question.|sd
Uh, does, does the WALL STREET JOURNAL, uh, -|qy
I, I've kind of gathered lately that, uh, maybe their information is not just only related to business.|sv
Is that, is that a correct assumption?|qy
That, that is certainly true.|na
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, they will, they will have articles, -|sd
like a few days ago they had a, a nice article on Einstein, you know --|sd
Oh.|bk
Oh.|bk
Uh-huh.|b
Now, these are feature kind of articles.|sd
Wow.|ba
All the, all the, uh, you know, the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities.|sd
Right.|b
But, but there is some very good other articles --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Do you find that you're, uh, uh, disappointed or pleased with, uh, uh, the performance of like network coverage of news?|qy
Uh, I wish it were in more depth.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, that doesn't mean to say longer,|sd
just more facts would be nice.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, C N N has, has, you know, was, was pretty good during the war.|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
definitely.|aa
Uh, and they were, you know, sort of had a unique vantage point for, for doing that reporting.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So, but, you know, it's not, it's never quite, -|%
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Well, I take it since you selected this topic that you have children.|qy^d
No,|nn
I don't,|sd
You don't?|bh
but I have nine younger brothers and sisters.|sd
My goodness.|ba
So. Well, I have two daughters|sd
and, um, they're past this, they've been latchkey children for a while,|sd
and they're almost where I can start saying they're, you know, young adults,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore.|sd
Um, we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask,|ad
Uh-huh.|b
I would assume it's, you know, if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that. -|%
Well, if I were look-, -|%
Or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing.|sv
Exactly.|aa
Exactly.|aa
Um, I think my, my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children.|sd
Yes,|aa
I would think someone older|sd
and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b^m
And I think that varies.|sv
I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child.|sv
Yes,|aa
that's true also.|aa
Um, you know, it's, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, you know, really, really qualified --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Um, with a, with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
Well, um, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was younger.|sd
I'm twenty-two now|sd
and I did most of my baby-sitting when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen.|sd
But, um, the only thing people ever asked me, -|sd
well, of course, they knew I came from a family with younger kids,|sd
but they really didn't ask me if I was used to children or not.|sd
The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay.|sd
Oh, uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
You know, and, um, I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone, you know, I would want to know, I personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before.|sd
Well, I, my experience, I baby-sat a lot also at, when I grew up|sd
and, um, coming from, you know, that background and the background as a parent now, I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a, a lot of times baby-sitters, -|sv
I know I did this with my children,|sd
it's, you get somebody where you kind of know the family already.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Becaus-, because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself|sd
so they, they thought, okay,|sd
she knows how to, how to treat children.|^q
Yes.|b
Well, see when, um, I first got my mai-, my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange.|sd
Um, this lady saw us at church|sd
and she was a you-, you know, she was a younger lady.|sd
She didn't really know my mom.|sd
She knew my mom by name|sd
and that was it.|sd
And, um, she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family|sd
so she just asked my mom if I could baby-sit.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
You know, she really didn't know my name or anything, you know,|sd
I thought that was pretty strange.|sd
You know, and she had two children.|sd
One was still in diapers when I started baby-sitting.|sd
Wow.|ba
So, um, she pretty much, you know, just assumed that I would know, you know, how to handle them.|sd
So, I wa-, you know, I enjoy kids|sd
and I get along with them very well|sd
so there's no problem.|sd
But, uh, with today's world and the kids today, uh, there's no way, I can't say that I would just ask someone, you know, that I didn't know like that to baby-sit.|sd
Oh, I agree with you,|aa
but there again she, you know, she knew, knew of your family,|sv
Uh-huh,|aa
that's true.|aa
and she, and she met in a safe setting, such as church.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So she was going on those two instincts.|sv
Just the same I know myself,|sd
I never, -|%
and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.|sd
Oh, I would be too|sd
And, and in i-, it really shocked me|sd
because just about six months ago someone came to my front door, rang the doorbell.|sd
She had just moved in the neighborhood.|sd
She had her daughter with her,|sd
and the daughter was, oh, about a second grader.|sd
And she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child.|sd
Oh, my.|ba
And I thought, well she doesn't know me or my children from anything.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
And it was, I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because I didn't know her --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yes.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So, I mean people are so different.|sv
Oh, I know.|aa
Um, well, I real-, I, obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything.|qy^d
Well, I did, I did have, um, my, my child, uh, in a day care for just a short time a-, when my oldest was about two and a half --|arp_nd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I worked just a part-time job|sd
and, uh, in, in those situations, um, what I did is I'd, I went in|sd
and, you know, I made a few phone calls,|sd
I went in and visited.|sd
I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, that was a concern with me.|sd
Um, you know, c-, you, you learn a lot by going in there|sv
and they e-, they explain to you, you know, what their day consists of and what their general rules are,|sv
and, um, that's, you know, that's as much as I know.|sd
You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, -|%
But I, -|%
go ahead.|ad
How did you stumble upon the day-care center?|qw
Did you just look it up in a phone book|qy
or what was it?|qw
Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think most people do that.|sv
I think you start out with the criteria of, you know, do I know of anything|sv
or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care|^q
and, -|%
Yeah,|b
there is , I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth.|sv
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
And then, you know, I mean, even at that you have to consider the logistics of it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north.|sv
Yes,|aa
exactly.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
So there, there are just so many considerations.|sv
Uh-huh.|aa
Then again, did, um, money come into play with it at all?|qy
Oh, money is always a factor in my life,|na
I've never, you know, I've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor. Um, even in something as important as day care.|sd
I know if I didn't have that stipulation, I would have done things differently --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued,|sd
but that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look at.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a full-time basis.|sd
Yes.|b
So, and, and then when you get, you know, when you get into the full-time basis day care, -|%
Good morning.|fp
Hi.|fp
My name is Jean.|fp
I'm Tina.|fp
Oh, where you from Tina?|qw
I live in Garland, Texas.|sd
Oh, Garland, Texas,|bk
I'm in Pennsylvania.|sd
Oh, my lands, you're the farthest person I've ever talked to.|sd
Really?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Do you work for Texas Instruments?|qy
My husband does.|ng
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Probably most people you talk to do, huh?|qy
Most of them do.|na
Now, I don't have anybody that works for T I,|sd
but, uh --|sd
Huh.|b
I don't know what|sd
I see,|b
well that's neat.|ba
So, I guess we're supposed to talk about foods today.|sd
Yeah,|aa
I guess you have to push one, though.|ad
Yes,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
Okay.|b
You ready?|qy
Yeah.|ny
Okay.|bk
Uh, foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that.|sd
Yeah,|b
I guess so,|^h
it may be interesting, because probably here in Texas, we may eat a little differently than you do up there|qy^d
Well, I don't know,|arp_nd
my brother lives down East of us down there,|sd
and I don't think they ate all that much different|sd
Oh, really.|b
Uh, I think as long as you plan your basic foods,|sv
course, for a dinner party, you fancy things up a little bit more.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that's true.|aa
Uh.|b
Well, uh, the thing that I found interesting, -|sd
my husband and I lived up in Washington State for awhile --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
-- and up there, of course they ate a lot of sea food,|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
and down here, sea food is pretty expensive, because,|sv
Right.|b
Yeah,|aa
and it's not as good as if it's fresh.|sv
Right,|aa
and, and, uh, and, but here, we eat a lot of like Mexican foods,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, um, up there there was no, no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me.|sd
Is that right?|bh
Yeah,|ny
it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could,|sd
but it just,|sd
Yeah,|b
well, they probably were trying to do the best they could.|aa
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b^m
and, uh, down here, we eat a lot more fried foods, I think.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Like chicken fried steak,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Up there, uh, it was hardly ever heard of|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea|sd
Yeah,|b
well they do in the summertime,|sv
I think that --|sv
Really?|bh
Yeah.|b
Of course, you have warmer weather most of the time.|sv
Right.|b
So, uh, -|%
Yeah,|aa
it never gets real cold.|sv
Yeah.|b
So, I, -|%
Yeah,|b
but when, when we have a dinner party around here, I think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular.|sd
Is that right?|bh
Yeah.|ny
I know that, um, I do a lot of planning with our church,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and a lot of the times when we get together, well everybody will bring a Mexican dish|sd
or.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh|b
Uh-huh.|b
More like covered dishes for those type of dinners.|bf
Uh-huh.|aa
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|aa
How about you,|qo
what is real popular up there?|qw
Well, I don't know,|no
just about anything|arp_nd
Oh, really.|bh
Yeah,|ny
we, we really, uh, use most anything.|sd
I, uh, I think like parties and that though are, -|%
well, like we had a dinner party here, here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party|sd
Oh.|bk
But, basically, we tried, you know, included all the basic, uh, foods that you are supposed to have in a meal .|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Your, uh, bread family and your, -|sd
or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and ,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
uh, something from each, each area that you're supposed to choose from.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, we, we, we ourselves are into the wok cooking,|sd
you know they been advertising that|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, that's good.|ba
They have a lot of vegetable to them,|sv
and, uh,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
right.|b
Oh, yes.|aa
I, I love that kind of cooking.|sd
My, uh, unfortunately, I am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things|sd
Is he a meat and potato person?|qy
Right.|na
They.|sd
Well, all our family is, is gone.|sd
They are out on their own.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh.|sd
That probably makes it easier,|sv
but. -|%
and, uh. -|%
Yeah.|b
We find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese|sd
and, uh,|%
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Well, my husband didn't like that,|sd
so we, us kids, -|%
we had five children|sd
and we ate that when he, he wasn't going to be home for supper,|sd
Right.|b
that's what we had|sd
Yeah,|b
well, that's pretty much what we do,|sd
if dad's not coming home, we have macaroni and cheese,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, they like, uh, spaghetti.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You know, that's one meal,|sd
Uh, yeah.|b
and the whole family eats.|sd
But, uh, there are several things that, -|%
well as a matter of fact, I keep chicken nuggets handy all the time, because. -|sd
Oh, those always go good.|sv
Yeah,|aa
the children love them,|sd
Yeah.|b
and, uh, they are real easy to cook|sv
and,|sd
Yeah.|b
and my girls don't like beef,|sd
I,|h
Oh really.|b
Well maybe.|sv
I guess,|h
Well, yeah,|aa
it could be, bec-, they don't, -|%
I think it's the texture of it,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but it takes more chewing|sv
Right.|aa
Children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and it is easier to chew.|sv
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
So they're not too much into beef.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
My husband and I eat more beef than we should,|sd
but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them|sd
Right.|b
We don't really have, uh, you know, entertain too much.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I don't know if you do or not,|qy^d
but we, we don't a whole lot,|sd
we're more, once in a while, but mostly family,|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, most of the entertaining we do is church associated.|na
Uh-huh.|b
We have a real tiny little house,|sd
we don't have room really,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
But, we do get together for wh-, fellowships at our church,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, my husband and I do a lot of the planning in that.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, -|%
Well that's good.|ba
Yeah,|aa
it is|aa
and it's fun to, uh, -|sd
I like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish.|sd
Yeah,|b
we do a lot of that take ,|sd
Yeah.|b
and our homemakers meet at the church also,|sd
and, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
So, you don't really include any certain food groups,|sd
you just bring,|sd
Right.|b
That's right|aa
Sometimes you have all desserts,|sd
sometimes,|sd
Yeah|b
Yeah,|b
that's true,|aa
that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever,|sv
Yeah.|b
But, it doesn't happen very often,|sd
usually you get a pretty wide variety|sd
and you can, you can ,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|aa
I remember one time we had a progressive dinner.|sd
Oh, those are fun.|ba
It's the only time that ever. -|%
Yeah|aa
they are.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
But it's the only time tha-, I can remember that, -|sd
I can't remember what food it was|sd
I, it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with.|sd
Several people were supposed to bring,|sd
Uh, uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers|sd
and,|sd
Oh, uh-huh|b
,|b
Was there enough to go around?|qy
Well, not really,|ng
you know we all took real tiny little portions,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
we were not sure who didn't show up with the food|sd
Yeah,|b
that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you, because they are grown adults usually|sv
Yes.|aa
and you know they know better.|sv
Right.|b
Even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook .|sv
Right.|aa
Either, either go ahead and fix your dish|sv
or call someone that can.|sv
Right.|aa
Right.|aa
I know it.|b
Well, that sounds neat,|ba
I can't, uh, believe you're so far away,|sd
but you sound so close.|sd
They said that we could share, we share,|sd
It sounds like you're here in Dallas.|sd
but, I'm up at my daughter's,|sd
I don't even have any of my recipes with me.|sd
Oh.|b
Uh, you know , -|%
I don't know if I have anything handy,|sd
we were just about, we were getting ready to go swimming,|sd
Oh.|b
and we're waiting on my sister.|sd
Oh, great.|ba
Cara, hold on just a second another person in the|t3
As a matter of fact, my,|sd
They are ready to go.|^2
Well, we probably, have we talked long enough|fc
I, -|%
I think it probably has been.|fc
Okay,|fc
so I'll let, -|%
So, I've enjoyed talking to you.|fc
Oh, same here.|fc
You have a good day.|fc
Thank you.|fc
Thanks for calling.|fc
Uh-huh.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Have you faced, uh, elderly care yet, uh, nursing home care for any of your parents?|qy
Unfortunately, yes.|ny
Uh, in fact, tonight I had the dinner with, uh, my three brothers and our wives|sd
and we were talking, uh,|sd
we had a review with the nursing home staff.|sd
My mother's in a nursing home.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, we had a review today|sd
and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you don't really like, like, uh making decisions on living wills and --|sd
Yes.|b
so, yes,|ny
I'm very familiar with it|sd
and it's not something that is, uh, you know,|sv
I never thought I'd have to go through this kind of experience.|sd
But I guess we all do.|sv
I think sooner or later, uh,|aa
both my mother and my husband's mother, we had to end up putting in nursing homes|sd
and they were to the point that they only lived, both of them, about six weeks once they got in.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
And, uh-huh.|ny
And it's absolutely, I believe that was one of the hardest things I ever did.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I, that, it just, you know, it's absolutely devastating.|sv
Right.|b
What have you found in dealing with the nursing homes?|qw
Well, they're not, every, all the horror stories you hear about them I think are true.|sv
Yes|aa
Uh, we've, you know, we've looked around|sd
and, my wife has looked at, extensively at all the ones in the area|sd
And the one she is in now, uh, there's a lot of drawbacks, a lot of things we don't like.|sd
But, again, it's no different than every one.|sv
And, you know, the cost of it, the, three thousand dollars a month --|sd
Um, uh-huh.|b
-- when you think about it, for what you're paying a hospital for --|sv
Yes.|aa
Yes.|aa
It's not that expensive, really.|sv
No,|aa
uh, there, well, there's a little bit of difference in, in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, theirs both ran, -|%
oh, I think my mother-in-law's was like fifteen hundred|sd
and my mother's was two thousand.|sd
Then, this has been five years ago.|sd
And, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
when I started out with my mother-in-law, because she was in there first, I --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they knew.|sd
And if I'd pop in unexpectedly, I discovered, you know, they did a little bit, they did better.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
You know, uh-huh.|ny
And, you know, a couple of times with my mother-in-law, I would catch something not being taken care of.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so I got to where, I knew then when my mother was in that, you know, not to go the same time all the time.|sd
Yeah.|b
and when I was looking for the nursing homes, another thing that I learned, uh, -|sd
we had my mother all set to go into one|sd
and for some reason I just went back, and on my own went around the different floors.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, I saw areas that they had not shown me|sd
and they did not come across as well --|sd
Well, I'll be darned.|ba
so, uh, we did not put her in that one.|sd
We put her in another one that I, I went a couple of times --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
you, you know, this is the whole point.|sv
You've got, you've got to shop them.|sv
Yes,|aa
you do.|aa
I know my mother's in now, in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, the fact that these people are they're up and around,|sd
but they're, they're, it's reminds me too much of an asylum type s-, --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And it's very, very, -|%
Does your mother have Alzheimer's?|qy
She, -|%
well, who knows.|no
They call it, uh, dementia.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, we don't know.|no
I, I mean she does not know us anymore --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it's, basically the same.|sd
And her health is not that bad.|sd
Although she has gone down, downhill drastically since this, this last, -|sd
well, she had been in a retirement community|sd
and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children.|sd
Well --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, but she, she has gone down steadily since she has been in,|sd
and she's been in the nursing home now for, oh, I would say about three months.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, -|%
Did she know that she was going to a nursing home?|qy
I'm sorry?|br
Did she know that she was going to a nursing home?|qy
She, -|%
no,|nn
as far as she knew, she was going to a hospital.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we says, you know, mom, if you, you know, if you get a, you get better, you've got to have the care, the doctor insisted on it, you know, if you get better that you could come out.|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
what kind of car are you going to buy next?|qw
Well, one of the cars I'm thinking about buying next is, uh, a nice, safe, small car,|sd
but, um, uh, the reason being, is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we have another four door car that I drive to work,|sd
and I think it'd be more economical if I were able to a smaller car --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That's true,|aa
that's true.|aa
What, what are you looking at?|qw
Well, I'm really not looking at anything for a while,|arp_nd
but --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and you think, Oh, well, maybe, maybe I would like a new car.|sv
Oh, yeah|b
But I think I'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway.|sd
Oh, yes,|b
oh, yes.|b
But, uh. -|%
Well, the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the -- -|sv
Right,|aa
they are.|aa
I sure do like the looks of that new Mit-, Mitsubishi Diamante.|sd
Oh, yes,|b
oh, yes.|b
That is a pretty car.|sv
I'm, uh, I really like the looks also of the new Mazda --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
that's pretty, too.|sv
but um, I, uh, you know, the, the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now.|sd
Yeah,|b
they get pretty expensive.|sv
Yes,|aa
they do.|aa
The last one I bought, I bought a, uh, -|sd
well, it's a, it's a Town Car,|sd
but it was a demo, returned --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I got it with like, you know, I think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it --|sd
Right.|b
Well, you can't go wrong with that kind of opportunity.|sv
So I was really pleased to find that,|sd
and I then, I bought it for cheaper,|sd
I was looking at a Honda Accord, a brand new one --|sd
Yes.|b
-- and I bought this, uh, the, the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what I was going to buy the new Honda Accord.|sd
Wow.|ba
Well, you get a much bigger, better --|sv
And the thing about it is --|sd
Yes.|b
Well, that's fantastic.|ba
That's real, real good.|ba
So, uh, I have really been impressed.|sd
I said, I probably never be able,|sd
No,|aa
do you, -|%
But I have loved this car better than anything I've ever driven, because you can go on the road and get there|sd
and you're not even tired.|sd
Very comfortable, smooth ride, huh.|qy
And it gets like twenty-six miles to the gallon on the road.|sd
Oh, it does?|bh
It sure does.|na
That's, that's unbelievable for that size of car.|sv
I, they kept telling me that,|sd
and I thought they're crazy,|sd
so the week after I got it, well, actually before I signed the papers on it, I took it over to Boozier City --|sd
Yes.|b
-- and it did it.|sd
Wow.|ba
That's great.|ba
But it's, uh, -|%
That's great.|ba
That kind of gas mileage, uh, we're, we're kind of hoping for on our van.|sd
Yeah.|b
Well, that's kind of what we've always been told, you know, they'll do,|sd
and then we hope for it,|sd
and it never happens --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but it really, it does get good gas mileage.|sd
Well, that's excellent.|ba
Most of the time when I don't go anywhere I can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work, you know, and then fill it up,|sd
so. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Do you, uh, do, does it, uh, need a lot of repairs?|qy
Is it a very reliable kind of car?|qy
I haven't had anything,|sd
I've taken it in twice for like just really minor things,|sd
and it cost me the twenty-five dollars.|sd
The, uh, really something really silly when we first got it,|sd
we couldn't get the light, -|sd
they have all these lights in the car --|sd
Yes.|b
-- and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat --|sd
Yes.|b
-- and we couldn't get the light to turn off.|sd
Um.|b
And we kept trying, you know,|sd
and we went out to dinner with some friends,|sd
and it stayed on all night, you know --|sd
Oh dear.|ba
Oh dear|ba
-- and we couldn't get it to turn off,|sd
and the next day my husband goes out there|sd
and he tries to get it off,|sd
we turn the knob, you know, in the front that's supposed to turn the --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and he took it in,|sd
and they said, you know, you just have to press the switch.|sd
He says, I've pressed every switch in that car,|sd
and I can't get the light off,|^q
it's broken.|^q
Yes.|b
So they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars,|sd
and they called and told us though, that all you have to do is turn the off switch,|sd
and they showed us where the switch was.|sd
They charged you twenty-five dollars just to tell you that, huh.|bf
They, they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch.|aa
Uh-huh,|b
oh, so they probably went through the, -|qy^d
But he hadn't, he hadn't done the right one.|sd
I see|b
And it's right on the arm rest in the back --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we didn't know it was there.|sd
Oh, okay.|b
And the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car --|sd
And found it right away.|qy^d
-- and so we thought, you know, there, there was, it was broken.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But we've had just, uh, -|%
I guess it's been in two times.|sd
I've had it three years now.|sd
Yes.|b
And, uh, it's been in two, maybe three times.|sd
But it's just been real minor things.|sd
Well, I think that, uh, you have an excellent deal then,|sv
and the, the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs --|sv
That's right.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
-- and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all,|sv
so. -|%
That's right.|aa
But it's really, it's been an enjoyable car.|sd
Like I say, I'll probably never be able to have another one, because I think we bought it for about sixteen thousand, you know --|sd
Yes|b
-- and I said, I'll never find another one for that price.|sv
No,|aa
not at all.|aa
And they keep going up,|sv
so I'll have to enjoy it,|sd
Okay Brian.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Hi,|fp
how you doing Kevin?|fp
Fine, thanks|fp
Good,|ba
good,|ba
glad to hear that.|sd
I understand, -|%
Are you a total banner?|qy
Total banner?|qy
Yeah.|ny
No,|nn
I, I believe that, uh, the American public and I, as an individual and private citizen have a right to, to bear arms and to have a gun as long as I, uh, am responsible with it and protect the safety and welfare of my kids|sv
and, and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it.|sv
I think that education with a gun is, is critical and important.|sv
Uh, however, I do believe that, uh, guns ought to be maintained and, and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns|sv
and in the heat of the moment, they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people,|sv
so on a scale of one to ten, I, I think I would rate myself as a, in the six or seven or eight.|sd
Okay.|bk
But, I think that there ought to be some control,|sv
but I still think that, uh, individuals have a right.|sv
How do you feel about it?|qo
Well, so, let me make sure,|^h
so you think that, uh, maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate?|qy
Well, I don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate.|no
Uh, that, uh, that might cool down some tempers.|sv
I think a, a one day would be sufficient.|sv
The reason I say that is there is an awful lot of people who go to gun shows|sv
and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun, if that five day waiting period were in effect, you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show.|sv
Uh, you just, you would be able to buy it,|ar
but they'd just have to mail it to you, I suppose, huh.|sv
Well, I don't think you can mail thing, guns through the mail.|ar
I don't know.|h
Oh.|b
Okay.|b
I think that's a, against the law ever since Kennedy was assassinated|sd
Oh, yeah?|bh
So, how do you feel about guns?|qo
Let's see,|^h
I think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns|sv
and I think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- whether, you know, -|%
Well, do you think that there will continue to always be crazies?|qy
Sure.|na
Then, uh, how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns?|qo
Well, we have some laws on the books that, uh, don't allow convicted felons to purchase guns, if I understand correctly.|sd
And, uh, I would agree,|sd
a, a short waiting period would be appropriate to, uh, take care of the heat of the moment type things,|sv
but --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway.|sv
Okay.|bk
Do you, uh, do you feel there is a need in the world today to have a, an automatic handgun?|qy
The only purpose for handguns is to shoot people, in my opinion.|sv
O-, or you could do it just for fun, you know, kind of like a game,|sv
but, uh, -|%
Well, I think that the, the police, uh, or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves,|sv
but, the public, I don't know.|sv
I think that I should have a right to own a handgun.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Not a automatic, semiautomatic.|sv
Yes,|aa
not an Uzi|sv
No,|aa
no.|aa
Uh, but I think a person needs a way of defending themselves.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You saw Indiana Jones,|qy^d
the guy came after him with that big knife.|sd
Yes.|ny
And just, he took care of it,|sd
just one shot.|sd
Yes,|aa
that's true,|aa
and he, uh, saved himself in the, in the, in the process also.|sd
That's right.|aa
So how is work going?|qw
Very fine,|sd
very, -|%
They don't let you take guns to work, do they?|qy
No,|nn
they,|sd
Although down here in Texas, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That's still --|sd
Can they be,|qy
or does it have to, -|%
Oh, you can't,|ng
no,|nn
it should not --|sd
Has to be on the hip?|qy
It has to be on the hip|na
Has to be in sight so that, uh, you know, that you're not, uh, a menace or --|sd
Can a s-, -|%
How about where you live there in Utah?|qo
Okay, Howard,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
what do you think of our space budget|qo
and should we go ahead and, and keep exploring,|qy
or should we call a halt to it,|qrr
is it doing any good?|qy
I think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country.|sv
Now I think what, we made a major wrong turn when we went into the, uh, to the current generation of space craft, the reusable ones, like they are now --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and I think some of the earlier approaches were much more, uh, much better in many ways.|sv
However, uh, you know, we've gained an awful lot from the space program, all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to, uh, some new space age materials, plastics and all that.|sv
So I think it's been a good investment.|sv
Uh, somebody was telling me the return was about twenty-five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent --|sd
Oh, really.|b
Oh, yes.|b
Wish our post office could do that|sd
I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates.|sd
That's right.|aa
I wish they'd just deliver stuff.|sd
I think, though, that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the, uh, oh, I don't know, the guilt that we had out of, uh, Challenger,|sv
I think maybe we can --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, I, I don't know.|h
I don't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives.|sv
I agree.|aa
The space station's where we should go --|sv
I agree.|aa
Seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor|sv
and, you know, you know, and I'm in favor of, you know, getting closer to seeing certain things,|sd
but I'd like to see them also go, you know, go back up there, see, you know, what they can do. See about setting a space station up.|sd
I'm all in favor of the space program,|sd
and I don't think we should stop,|sv
and I don't think we should cut the money.|sv
Well, where do you think we ought to go with it?|qo
Uh.|^h
You talking about, uh, uh, a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there?|qy
Yeah,|ny
I would like, I'd like to see that.|sd
I'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what's going on, even if, you know, there's no life up there or anything, you know.|sd
But who knows.|h
And I would like to see them do something like that.|sd
Well, -|%
I, I hate to see them just, you know, keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things|sv
and, I think they, I think they lose sight of, of probably what they're supposed to be doing.|sv
Well, I think about half the nations now are, are military related, are they not?|qy
Yes,|ny
yes.|ny
And, uh,|sv
I believe they are.|sd
You know, let's go back to our original thing with, you know, our experiments and all the, you know, our actual exploring of space and, and all that,|ad
and, you know, with, with Russia, uh, seemingly not going to be as big a threat.|sv
Well, it can't afford to|sv
Huh-uh, you know.|aa
Have you gone out to, uh, Fort Worth to see the space, Soviet space exhibit?|qy
No,|nn
we were talking about that this weekend.|sd
We, it's only going to be there a couple of more weeks.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
We need to go.|sd
We went, uh,|sd
we took our grandsons and went, uh, the weekend before last,|sd
and it is marvelous.|sd
I mean, it's really neat how they, they have done it.|sd
They have done a beautiful job.|sd
Have they?|bh
And they have a, uh, scaled down model showing how they, you know, fuel it, or, you know, how they, uh, oh, the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they, uh, -|sd
all the things that are against the actual space mission, uh, space ship, you know, how they fall away from it,|sd
and the loading of it --|sd
Oh, yes.|b
-- and then it's actually, you know, -|sd
the smoke comes out like it's taking off.|sd
It is really interesting.|sd
Well, maybe I need to run out there this weekend.|sv
You really do.|aa
It's, it's well worth the time and effort.|sd
We went, uh, early on Sunday.|sd
We got out there about, uh, ten, ten thirty,|sd
and the, -|%
Now do you have to have tickets ahead?|qy
Excuse me.|fa
No,|nn
we bought tickets there,|sd
and if you have children, if you go to McDonald's, you co-, they have coupons, or did have.|sd
Now they may be through with them now.|sd
But, uh, buy one adult|sd
and one child gets in free.|sd
Um, I think both of my kids are too old for that --|sd
Oh, okay,|b
oh, okay.|b
-- they're both, uh, -|%
You have teenagers or something.|qy^d
Yes,|ny
yes.|ny
Yes,|b^m
well I had grandchildren so, three of them, so between their mother and their grandfather and I, -|sd
because their dad was at work|sd
and, uh,|sd
Did you, -|%
they really did like it.|sd
It's very impressive, I'm sure.|qy^d
Uh-huh,|ny
it is,|sd
and I felt the, uh, six year old would, you know, that he'd be kind of bored,|sd
but he wasn't.|sd
Even the three year old enjoyed it --|sd
-- because they had one, had one of those moon vehicles --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So it was really neat.|sd
Well, see, that's something else.|ba
The Russians have had space stations, manned stat-, space stations for years now.|sd
You know, they had the Merv --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
-- and see we've yet to keep anyone up over --|sd
Right.|b
Well, in going through it, I got the impression that actually they were farther ahead,|sd
I'm ready.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
All right.|b
Do you exercise, uh, during the day time --|qy
Oh.|b
Yeah,|ny
I, I used to go to a gym, um, last summer,|sd
but then I started school again,|sd
so, it's, um, so I don't exercise as much as I'd like.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, I, I do enjoy, um, going to a gym and working out,|sd
or just like, I do sit ups sometimes before I go to bed or when I wake up,|sd
and I ride a exercise bike a lot.|sd
So. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I try to do it at night before I go to bed.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, it's really weird,|sv
because I'll get down on the floor,|sd
and I'll holler and tell my cat Nikki,|sd
I'll say, Nikki, I'm going to do my exercises,|sd
And she can be upstairs in the bedroom,|sd
and I don't know.|h
She knows what I'm talking about.|sd
You know, pretty soon, here she comes.|sd
So, I lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I had a problem with my back,|sd
so, when I went to physical therapy --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
So, I just try to keep that up, because it seems like if I don't, then, then my back gives me a problem again.|sd
Right.|b
So I try to do it every night,|sd
and uh. -|%
Oh, that's good.|ba
Yeah,|aa
it seems like it's, you know, -|%
I can tell when I do it and when I don't do it --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
so you know it's got to be good for you.|sv
Right|b
But, um, a long time ago I belonged to a gym --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, uh, now I notice that this, in this small city that I live in, they do have a, a gym that just opened up here about a month ago.|sd
Oh.|b
So, I was kind of thinking about joining it,|sd
but I haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, it does really make you feel good,|sv
and I like to bicycle, too.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
So, that gives you, you know, lots of exercise.|sv
Yeah,|aa
it does.|aa
Yeah.|aa
So. -|%
I enjoy that a lot.|sd
I, um, bike in the summer.|sd
I belong to a biking club here in Kenosha.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, um, we go on a, like fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday.|sd
Oh, my goodness.|ba
So I try to keep up in the winter with the exercise bike, so, I, you know, can be in shape .|sd
Yeah,|b
otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far, huh?|qy
No,|nn
huh-uh.|nn
No,|nn
I go with my dad.|sd
He exercises a lot more than I do, though.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Oh, yeah,|ny
he's --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But, I'm not that energetic|sd
Yeah.|b
I get lazy sometimes.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, like I say, I just do it at night, you know,|sd
and, um. -|%
Yeah.|b
Do you like you try, try to get my stomach muscles toned up.|qy
Oh, yeah,|ny
that's what I like to do.|sd
You know, because, boy, they seem like they really get out of shape,|sd
and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape --|sv
Uh-huh.|aa
Yeah.|aa
So, I've just been doing it, I try to do it every night --|sd
Yeah.|b
like I say, you just, I'd rather do that than watch television anyhow --|sd
Oh.|b
Wow|ba
So it's just kind of nice, and especially when I have my cat that comes down and joins me.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
that is neat|ba
You know, so. Well, I guess that's about all I can tell you about my exercising.|sd
I wish I knew how to swim,|sd
but I don't,|sd
so I don't go swimming.|sd
Yeah,|b
um, I don't swim much, neither.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
but they do say that swimming is really, really good for you --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So I wished I, I wished I did know how to do that.|sd
If they had a pool here in Patterson I'd probably, you know, put my bathing suit on and go down there,|sd
but they don't have a pool in this small city, either.|sd
Oh. Um.|b
So. Well, listen then,|fc
it's been nice talking to you.|fc
Yeah,|fc
nice talking to you.|fc
Okay then.|fc
Okay.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Um, bye.|fc
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Okay.|b^m
Do you, uh, do any woodworking?|qy
I do,|na
and I really love it. Um.|sd
Oh, um, what do you do,|qo
for a hobby or for, -|qy
Uh-huh,|ny
I do it for a hobby --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I have my own equipment,|sd
and I have a jig saw and a scroll saw and, uh, in the process of getting a router --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so, I like to cut out my wood, and then tole paint on the items that I cut out.|sd
What kind of things do you like to do with wood?|qo
Well, I'm not the one that cuts them out.|arp_nd
My husband cuts them out --|arp_nd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, uh, he likes using the little band saws and jig saws --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then, uh, he's got a router,|sd
but now he wants a plunge router.|sd
Oh.|bk
Yeah.|b
But anyhow, he cuts them out,|sd
and then I, I took a tole --|sd
Oh.|bk
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And what we want to do is, you know, make them, and then maybe take them to these craft shows or --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
But, uh, I really like it so far.|sd
Oh, that is fun.|ba
And then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so I took a pattern off of that,|sd
and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and then you, you make the dress for it,|sd
and you drill holes around the top of the head|sd
and you, you stick in --|sd
Oh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
the twine.|b
Yeah,|b
those are so cute.|sv
It looked really cute, you know.|sd
So I've got a couple of those started.|sd
They are really cute.|sv
Yeah,|aa
and then uh, but as far as wood work, that's all we've been doing right now.|sd
Oh, that is, that sounds really fun.|ba
well, they have a really fancy boutique out here in Ogden, Utah --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I just got back from that today,|sd
so if you could get your projects into boutiques, oh, they are wonderful.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You could make a lot of money from those.|sv
What do you do?|qo
I wonder how you, -|qw^d
you just, they buy them from you,|qy^d
or you just given them to them on consignment or something?|qrr
Uh, apparently,|na
like that boutique, um, they take, oh what was it, twenty percent of the sell price.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You would put your sell price --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
-- uh, and then they would take twenty percent off of that --|sd
Um, I see.|bk
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And so then at the end of the boutique, which usually runs for a week, then they give you what you earned|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
So, you have to decide what your price is going to be --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So if the customers are willing to pay it, then you get a profit.|sd
Oh, these little things are so cute, though, you know.|sv
They are.|aa
I. -|%
I, I have seen those.|sd
Those are darling.|sv
I went through some of the books down here at the craft shop, you know --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out.|sd
In fact, I just sent to Shop Smith --|sd
Oh.|%
Oh, that's what I want, is a Shop Smith|sd
Yeah,|b
we, well, --|sd
That's my ul-. -|%
Oh, does he?|bh
Oh, that's my ultimate dream|sd
Yeah,|ny
so anyhow.|%
Oh, you're lucky.|ba
Yeah,|aa
well, uh, he's retired now --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, I'm kind of semi retired.|sd
My company went bankruptcy,|sd
so I'm drawing my pension from them,|sd
but I'm still looking for a part time --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, he has all day long that --|sd
Oh.|b
How fun.|ba
And he's got a lot, a lot of tools,|sd
Oh, how nice.|ba
I'm jealous.|sd
Yes.|b
But, um, these little wooden things, they seem to sell really good.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, I know a lot of people that have gotten them, you know.|sd
My next door neighbor, every time she sees something, she thinks it's so cute she wants to buy it, you know|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
So, I'm just hoping that, you know, that we can get some cut out and painted, you know, before summer starts --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
No.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh. -|%
Well, how is the market for things like that in California?|qw
It seems, it seems like they go real good, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, the country, anyhow, out here -- -|%
Uh-huh.|b
-- and I live out in the valley --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and country seems to be the in thing out here --|sd
Oh.|b
everybody wants little country pieces.|sd
So anything that looks like it might be country is what they want, you know.|sd
They just snap it right up, huh.|qy
Yeah.|ny
Oh.|bk
And, uh, this little rabbit that I made in, uh, tole painting class, you know, is like a welcome.|sd
It's got a, it's going to have little wooden hearts holding it, in its hands --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
And, -|%
Do you have any?|qy
I'm trying to think offhand|no
I can't think of anything, you know.|ng
I have, I have one,|sd
Okay.|bk
and it's a real pet peeve of mine.|sd
It seems I, I do work during the day|sd
and when I'm home, uh, you know I'm either cooking or running doing,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I hate when the phone rings and it turns out to be a telephone salesman.|sd
Oh|b
And it's real, -|%
the two pet peeves that, -|sd
number one, I really feel that that's my private, you know, my own home.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I ha-, -|%
and if I want something, I will get it.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I will go out and get it myself.|sd
And I will never, I never buy anything from a telephone,|sd
Oh, I wouldn't,|aa
no.|aa
So, I really feel that it is a real invasion, they're invading my time and my space --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
fr-, -|%
and I, -|%
it really bothers me.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't, you know, ignore it, uh, quite as easily.|sv
Yeah.|b
And I, I try to be polite,|sd
but at the same point, -|sd
That doesn't always work.|^2
Well, I just say thank you very much for calling but I'm not interested,|sd
and then I hang up before they can say anything.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yes,|ny
and it works very well|sv
Oh|b
Because you don't hear, you know how, -|sd
they can say anything they want|sd
it's just, -|%
but I just feel that's my big thing on the invasion of, my thing on invasion of privacy.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, um, I have, uh, I sort of have a sort like -|sd
you can prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists.|sd
I wish that there were a way that you could, um, get your tele-, you know, submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
well, how do you get your name off the junk mailing list?|qw
Uh, you, you, you, you do that by, uh, um, -|sd
the postal service has some information which you fill out and they send,|sd
it's for every company,|sd
I mean you can't do it for any compan-,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
you know, but you can then send it|sd
and they can pro-, -|sd
they tell, -|%
that company is not allowed to sent it, you any junk mail.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
If you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can, -|sd
Oh, I didn't even know that.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to, not to get, you know, junk mail from specific companies.|sd
Oh, wow.|ba
And I wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company --|sd
Yeah.|b
-- and you could say that, uh, have your na-, your number put in a registry.|sd
And then anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
So that would be one way of doing it.|sd
I can't really think of anything that invades my privacy,|sd
but one of my pet peeves, you came up with the telephone is, when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I can't stand that.|sd
I think that is so stupid, you know,|sd
because, -|%
Oh, I'm guilty of that sometimes|sd
because I've called and there really wasn't any significant message|sd
and I, and I wasn't going to be available to be called back.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it was sort of like, oh, the hell,|sd
I'm not going to spend the time giving,|sd
and, uh, I'll call later,|sd
Yeah.|b
The other thing that, um, that there is recourse to and that's another thing, is when you, you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, leg-, legally now they're not allowed,|sd
they're n-, -|%
you do not have to give a telephone number.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Yes.|ny
And I don't really like announcing in public -- -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- you know, when you're sitting there, -|sd
my telephone and I don't like the wa-, way telephone numbers can be used.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number,|sd
but it turned out it had to have been my husband's office phone number.|sd
And, uh, we were able, we weren't actually able to trace it, but we were able to, to discard the charges.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, but it was, -|sd
I don't like how they a-, -|sd
the, -|%
I, I realize that this is your identification|sd
but I worked with someone that got hold of his,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
same with my husband.|sd
It was the charge card and social security number.|sd
And, you know, I don't, I don't like, I don't g-, ever get anything over the phone because I don't want to give my social security number out.|sd
Well, you should never give the social security number.|sd
Uh, if sometimes, if you charge, -|sd
sometimes I charge theater tickets --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then, you know, because they pick them up at the box office we'll call.|sd
But, um, that's the only thing I would ever have ever used it for the phone|sd
and that was because I initiated it.|sd
Yes.|b
Uh, and occasionally I do order things from catalogs --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But again it's, I initiate it not the company.|sd
The other thing is though you do not have to, -|sd
if you're buying something in a store and they as-, and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number, you do not have to give it.|sd
That is one, that's a law that went into effect, I don't know a year or two ago.|sd
Oh, I never even knew that.|sd
And, uh, you can just say I'm sorry that yo-, uh, I'm not required to give that by law|sd
and then they won't, -|%
a lot of stores will still ask.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, the credit card company, you know, accepts the charges.|sd
I mean it-, -|%
a rea-, -|%
the credit cards company's responsibility. -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, is there any,|qy
So wha-, in this , -|%
Um, well, this would, this is limited to the privacy issue, the invasion of privacy.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
Yeah,|b
and I guess, uh, that was my, that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy. For people outside the family, of course,|sd
I've got little pet peeves, you know, with my family.|sd
You know. But of course, th-, -|%
I guess that just comes with the, uh, with the territory with a family that -|sv
does a mother can do some privacy. -|%
I really,|sd
But, uh, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Nothing that you felt that, you know, -|qy^d
any experiences you've had at work?|qy^d
No.|nn
I, you know, othe-, -|%
I, I really can't say anything that would really bother me.|sd
So many things I think over the years have been, um, accepted, I mean when you, uh, that are no longer done.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I mean I can remember when I was very young, much younger and I applied for a job|sd
they said, well, d-, aren't you planning to have children.|sd
Well, I mean, that's none of their business.|sv
Yeah.|b
And but of course, now by law they can't ask that.|sd
Yeah.|b
So I mean there has been I think a lot to, done to protect privacy.|sv
Yeah,|aa
especially between women and, -|sd
How do you feel, -|qo
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
I-, -|%
i-, -|%
they've gotten a lot with, uh, -|%
applications and stuff and aren't allowed to ask. -|sd
That's right.|ba
No,|nn
because, -|%
I think it's for the better of like i-, -|sd
you mean like for working and stuff?|qy
Yeah,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
No,|nn
I don't because I think whenever, and something like that -|sd
they're looking out for everyone.|sv
They're not, -|%
Yeah.|b
you know, I think it's more safety than anything else.|sv
I feel that way too.|aa
I sometimes feel th-, you know, sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit.|sv
Yeah.|b
Because I know, -|%
You know, for example airline pilots. -|sd
I mean I do want my pilot to be sober|sv
Yeah.|b
Because I know, -|%
I worked at a still mill in this summer.|sd
And I know,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
and it, and it's dangerous.|sd
I don't even like having them around.|sd
I kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them, you know.|sd
That's right.|ba
Yeah,|b
I know i-, -|%
yeah,|%
I feel, you know, I think some of the people that oppose, you know, mandatory drug testing for certain areas say, well, it's not, -|sv
I've, uh, -|%
are you there?|qy
Yes, sir,|ny
I'm right here.|sd
All right|bk
Okay, um,|%
I'm in an area where, um, we can, uh, enjoy it year round,|sd
so, I've actually been, uh, uh, been out within the past couple of weeks.|sd
I'm mainly a freshwater fisherman.|sd
How about yourself?|qo
Well, actually I've done both kinds --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- uh, I'm originally from the State of Virginia --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Did you ev-,|qy
I don't believe I have fished the James River.|ng
There's a possibility, but that was so long ago --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- I moved here to, to State College, uh, in nineteen fifty-five --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we have a lot of, uh, beautiful fresh water streams that come through thi-, this area.|sd
I'm in an area called Center County, which is in the very center of the State of Pennsylvania,|sd
I've I've been in that area|sd
and the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary.|sd
The trout fishing is really, uh, beautiful.|sd
As I say, the, the streams are, oh, eight, ten, fifteen feet wide and so forth,|sd
and, uh, you, you stand on the edge and you, you cast out and you, you work, uh, from your feet most of the time --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
for brookies. -|^2
-- and then there are, there are a few lakes of course, close|sd
Yeah,|b
what do you like, brookies or, uh, rainbows|qy
or, -|%
I, -|%
wherever the area, -|%
whatever the fish is the specialist in that area, I, uh, I enjoy fishing for it,|sd
and I try to, -|sd
I haven't fished in several years --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Do you fly fish, or are those streams too small?|qy
Uh, no,|na
we, we fly fish.|na
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I used to do that a little when I lived up in New York,|sd
but --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, that's a pretty big fish.|sv
Uh, yeah,|aa
they're, they've, uh, -|%
the striped bass have accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes,|sd
and they're pretty exciting when they're, when they're running.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It's a salt water fish in fresh water, uh, environment.|sd
Well, our, our streams here are replanted with fish about every year --|sd
It's all put and take.|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and this is, of course, X number of weeks or months before fishing season opens|sd
so, -|%
What's the season?|qw
April to Sep-, October or something like that?|qy^d
That sounds about right --|na
Uh-huh.|b
-- uh-huh,|ny
pretty close.|sd
Uh --|%
You know. -|%
-- what's a license cost?|qw
Well, as I say, it's been several years,|sd
but the licenses weren't that expensive,|sd
I, -|%
seems to stick in my mind, five to seven dollars --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
It's about the same as Texas.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
And I have, oh, probably a half a dozen different kinds of, uh, fishing poles and, and fly rods and so forth,|sd
and, and I had been so busy in my work in these last few years that I haven't had time to fish.|sd
But I'm going to be retiring at the end of December,|sd
and I, I hope, uh, the next fishing season, that I can sort of get back in and, uh, enjoy that.|sd
That, that was a really enjoyable, uh, thing for me to do.|sd
Well, I have all sons, so I think I'm probably going to be fishing for a long time|sd
Huh, I just have one son and he, he lives out of the state now, rather, in the eastern corner of it,|sd
so, I don't think he has time to fish either|sd
I caught the disease from my father,|sd
and I'm passing it on to my children.|sd
It's really -|sd
Oh, is that right?|bh
They love it,|sd
yeah.|ny
Oh, my goodness.|ba
Right.|b
Well, I, I, the disease I caught was simply because, uh, I, I was in the Norfolk Portsmouth area,|sd
and --|%
Uh-huh.|b
there's, there's so much water around --|sd
Right.|b
Right.|b
-- and, uh, I fairly enjoyed at that time. -|sd
I have a small aluminum boat here --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
when I go on one of the large lakes that we have here that I enjoy fishing for, for trout from that,|sd
Uh, uh, I don't, I don't know about the lakes in central Pennsylvania.|sd
Are there many?|qy
Well, as I say, I'm in Center County.|sd
There's, um, there're two different size lakes about, well, five, six miles from State College.|no
Uh-huh.|b
Now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- but they are probably fifteen, twenty acres maybe --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
do, do you have a home, or apartment?|qy
Uh-huh,|ny
I have a home.|sd
Okay,|bk
do you have to do a lot of upkeep?|qy
Not really,|ng
we have a small backyard and small front yard --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but, uh, uh, I do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding|sd
and he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy|sd
That's another story.|sd
Okay|bk
And, uh, and, uh, I do the edging and stuff like that,|sd
but, uh, it doesn't take us that long because our, our yard is so small.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, I try and do as much, you know flowering as I can, and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
But, uh, I think we have one of the nicest yards in the, in the neighborhood|sd
Well, that's nice|ba
I wish I could say that.|sd
Ours is pretty small, too,|sd
but it, it takes about an hour with the two of us working --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Uh, the worst part is controlling the weeds.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
That's true.|ba
But we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway.|sd
Uh um, what else.|^h
I get to put out all the Christmas lights out there and all that,|sd
I don't|sd
No?|bh
No,|nn
he does that.|sd
Oh, okay.|bk
Well, if they, if they go up -|sd
like, one year we --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
and I --|%
I decided I was afraid|sd
Yeah.|b
Don't blame you|ba
So this year, he got lazy so I said, fine|sd
I'll put some on the bushes.|sd
And that's about it,|sd
that's all --|sd
Yeah.|b
Huh, okay,|b
we don't have that many bushes to put them on.|sd
Uh, our, our yard is very, uh, narrow --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so we have some bushes, but we don't have too many,|sd
but we have a nice tree in the front|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, wow.|ba
-- and, uh, they keep hitting it, the tree with the lawn mower.|sd
Oh, no.|ba
You know, every time you do that, it, uh, kind of kills the tree for a while.|sd
Yeah.|b
And so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again.|sd
Oh.|b
And we started mowing our own lawn --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- because they were doing that.|sd
And so, anyways I have a nice full tree now|sd
and, and we put , we fill it with lights and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
Um.|%
And they would, uh, they also edged, -|sd
when they would edge in, into the shrubbery and --|sd
so we, -|%
Yeah,|ny
because it's an association fee.|sd
Oh, is it real expensive?|qy
Yes --|ny
Oh, gosh.|ba
-- it's like seventy a month.|sd
Oh, my goodness.|ba
Yeah,|b
and I don't like, -|sd
I, I just get really upset every time I make that check out.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, -|%
Well, do, do they do other things for you all?|qy
They take care of the, uh, landscape,|sd
because we live in a cul-de-sac|sd
and there is a island in the middle --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- so they care of that|sd
and there is a pool and they take care of the pool --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, and there is a pond,|sd
they take care of the pond in the park area and that kind of thing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, so you're basically paying, oh, -|sd
and the sprinkler system that, -|sd
that -|%
our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system, but the island does|sd
and, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um.|%
So, -|%
But you knew when you moved in, you'd have to pay that, didn't you?|qy
Well, it, it, it went up what we pay.|na
Oh|b
And that's the bad thing.|sd
I just hope it doesn't go up any more|sd
because --|sd
Yeah.|b
I don't know what to do if you can't afford it|sd
I don't know either.|ba
That's interesting.|ba
So, uh, but, they're, -|%
that's what they do.|sd
They take care of basically the front yards and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Now do at a -|%
do things like plant bushes and trees?|qy
They, -|%
o-, only in, like, in the common areas and in the island.|na
Oh, okay.|bk
But they don't do it in your yard.|sd
So, there is, like, no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that?|qy
Right,|na
uh-huh,|ny
yeah,|ny
so we've added bushes and, and shrubbery, too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
when we moved into our house I just hated the bushes they had.|sd
I, I ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back.|sd
I know.|ba
And put new ones out front.|sd
But that was a lot of work.|sd
Yeah.|b
Took me a long time.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's what we did when we first moved in, too.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Just rearranged some things|sd
Yeah,|b
and then, then we put in a sprinkler system,|sd
and,|sd
Oh.|b
I will pay someone to do it|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Oh, it took so long.|sd
Oh.|b
Because my husband was, you know, digging the trenches because he didn't want to get a trencher, you know,|sd
there is a machine that will --|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Because, you know, there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it.|sd
And --|sv
Oh.|b
That's true,|aa
so gosh,|ba
you did it manually.|bf
By hand.|sd
Oh.|b
Oh, gosh.|ba
Yeah,|b
but it works great now that we've got it.|sd
I bet.|ba
Yeah,|b
it's nice.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's a good investment there.|sv
Yeah,|b
well, we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble,|sd
you know, you have to keep the, the area moist --|sd
Oh.|b
so, we had an incentive there --|sd
Oh.|b
Well, do you have any, uh, television programs that you watch regularly?|qy
Oh, this is kind of tough.|^h
I don't too often watch, you know, shows that are on, on a regular bases.|ng
Uh-huh.|b
I don't have a lot of time|sd
and I don't really like some of them to tell you the truth.|sd
I mean I don't thing they have any redeeming value.|sv
No.|b
But, uh, oh, I watch things like, uh, SIXTY MINUTES,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, ugh,|%
it's kind of tough to think of some of the others. Although, I do watch some of some of those frivolous things.|sd
Uh,|sd
Oh, you will?|bh
Yeah,|ny
just something like that for, you know, uh, end of the evening type of thing, -|sd
Relax.|bf
but, uh. How about you?|qo
Well, I watch, um, -|sd
I like news programs, like you mentioned,|sd
and sometimes I will watch, um, like the cable news, network evening news program.|sd
Yeah,|b
I don't get that so I don't have,|sd
Yeah,|b
I, I like that.|sd
I, I watch that a couple of times a week, um,|sd
it comes on like at nine o'clock,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I really don't have any like situation comedies that I watch regularly.|sd
I, I have seen that, um, MURPHY BROWN that comes on,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and it's kind of cute,|sv
Yeah.|b
and, but I don't, -|%
But there's a couple of those I've seen once in a while,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
uh, I can't think of the name of the one that has the, uh, military, uh, fellow.|sd
Oh, but, -|b
I mean he's playing a military part.|sd
He's the husband of,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
I know who you're talking about.|sd
I haven't, I have seen it, I think, maybe once.|sd
Yeah,|b
you know, it wa-, it was on one time when I saw it|sd
and, you know, it, it's pretty cute.|sv
I like that|sd
Well, I, um, I, -|%
we really don't watch too many programs regularly.|sd
My children like some of the morning children's shows,|sd
Yeah.|b
They, um, -|%
I just have one son who's in kindergarten|sd
so in the morning they will like to watch like, um, EUREKA'S CASTLE, it's called.|sd
It's just like a SESAME STREET,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but and they watch a couple of shows like that,|sd
but I don't watch any daytime T V at all.|sd
Yeah,|b
no|aa
I don't, -|%
And, uh, -|%
I guess, uh, there's some, uh, things on Channel Thirteen that I watch pretty regularly.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
On Saturdays they have, uh, a variety of things, uh,|sd
and a lot of times I record it and watch it some other time.|sd
But, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um.|%
and, um, they have a calligraphy show,|sd
and I do calligraphy, so, I watch that.|sd
Oh, that's nice.|ba
And, um, they have a lot of cooking shows,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, oh, you know, I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those.|sd
I don't sit and watch them but, but I enjoy some of it and especially if I'm, uh, cooking on a Saturday evening or something,|sd
and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me.|sd
That sounds like a good idea.|ba
I notice that, um, since we moved here that we, we did get the cable T V,|sd
and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I record some.|sd
And then, uh, we have just totally cut down,|sd
and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then,|sd
Yeah.|b
And so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved.|sd
Yeah,|b
we do some of that,|sd
In fact, I probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on T V,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, that's probably what I watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies|sd
and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies,|sd
Yes.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
those are pretty good|sv
I, I like those old ones,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
And so we, we have really enjoyed that|sd
and it's really nice not to be running out.|sd
Some of the video rentals can be expensive|sd
and, -|%
Yeah.|b
And, boy,|^2
the movie can be unbelievable.|^2
Uh-huh,|b
right.|b
Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something.|sd
So we, -|%
I have, -|%
and it's so convenient at home|sd
and you can do it anytime y-, you take the notion.|sd
Yeah.|b
And so, I have really enjoyed that|sd
but, but there are, -|%
I do have friends that watch programs|sd
like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it.|sd
They have some programs that they won't miss.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
I'm not that hung up to most things.|sd
I mean if I miss something big deal|sd
Yes.|b
Well, and things are repeated,|sv
Yeah.|b
That's true.|ba
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
the only one I've ever seen and it'll be showing again.|sd
Pretty funny.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, uh, T V is something that we try an-, to not, um, deliberately try not to get hung up on it,|sd
Yeah.|b
We do too.|sd
Too many other things to do and too much going on.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we don't want our kids to, to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your,|sd
Right.|b
Right.|aa
I agree.|aa
So it's a little bit, something that we try doing|sd
and there's, there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And you could say, oh, that's a good program for them because it's educational|sd
but still you want them to go out and do other things.|sd
Even if they're,|sd
Right.|b
Yeah.|b
Anyway. Well, -|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Okay.|b
Well, we probably exhausted that, huh?|qy
Yeah,|ny
That was pretty good|sv
I, I like that|sd
and, um, I guess it's time to go.|ad
Okay.|aa
I enjoyed talking to you.|fc
Yes.|fc
Nice to have spoken with you, too.|fc
Okay.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Good-bye.|fc
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
do we just go ahead?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Okay.|bk
Do you want to start?|qy
Uh, well, we're supposed to talk about vacations --|na
Right.|b
-- and, uh, I'm trying to think of the ones that I've been on that I liked the most|sd
and probably the one I liked most was Hawaii|sd
Oh, did you get to go to Hawaii?|qy
Yes.|ny
Yeah,|b
we went there for our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.|sd
It's lovely, isn't it?|qy
Yes.|ny
We went, uh, six months after we were married.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And we just went to, uh, two islands.|sd
What islands did you go to?|qw
We went to Oahu and Kauai.|sd
Kauai,|sd
uh-huh.|b
We went to Kauai,|sd
and then we also hit Maui,|sd
and then, of course, uh -- -|sd
The big one.|^2
-- uh, the big one,|b^m
uh-huh.|aa
Oh.|b
With, uh, the big one I thought was very commercialized.|sv
Oh, yeah.|aa
It was. -|sv
But the other two were just lovely.|sv
Yes,|b
I enjoyed Kauai better, too.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
it was quiet and restful, and, and so beautiful.|sv
It wasn't commercialized.|sv
Oh, it was rainy|sd
Yeah|b
was it?|qy
Rainy,|na
but, you know, we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway|sd
so, -|%
That's right.|b
Well, it wasn't real rainy.|sd
We had s-, a few showers, but, uh, nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones|sd
and, and, when, uh, -|%
now we went to Nassau|sd
and my husband liked it better than he did Hawaii.|sd
Oh, really?|bh
Uh-huh.|aa
Oh.|bk
Yeah,|b
he really did.|sd
I don't know why.|sd
You know, he didn't like Oahu at all|sd
He thought --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
Did you go there?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
That was wonderful --|sv
Yeah.|b
-- and we both enjoyed it --|sd
That was|sv
uh-huh.|b
You know, I've been to Nassau, too.|sd
Have you?|bh
I went on a cruise.|sd
Oh, neat.|ba
Uh-huh,|b
and, uh, to tell you the truth, I, I think I'd rather just go to the island.|sd
Yeah,|b
uh, our son and daughter-in-law just, uh, they got married last January and they won a cruise.|sd
And I know they didn't like it.|sd
Now, we have several friends that, uh, have been on, and just love them.|sd
But James and I like, -|sd
I don't know,|h
I think we would get bored on the boat all the time.|sd
Well, I, got sick.|sd
Oh, did you?|bh
Yeah,|ny
I did the first night.|sd
I went --|sd
Ooh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and, and we both, the first night, just had to leave dinner.|sd
Um.|%
It was bad,|sd
but, and then after that it was, it got better,|sd
but we just, -|%
it was a four day --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and we were both ready to get off the boat.|sd
Were you?|bh
Yeah.|ny
Well, I think if we ever go, it will only be for a three day.|sd
Now we've been real lucky.|sd
We've been to Europe twice.|sd
Oh, have you?|bh
Yeah.|ny
We went, the first time we went to London, Europe and touched a little bit of Scotland|sd
And second time we went to Munich, Germany and were there a week, and loved Germany.|sd
Oh.|b
It --|sv
Wow.|ba
I'll bet it is.|b
and we were there in the fall before the snows, you know, started|sd
and it was wonderful.|sd
It, uh --|sd
Oh.|b
And we would love to go back there|sd
and we'd love to go back to London.|sd
You haven't been to Spain?|qy
No --|nn
Oh.|b
-- have not been to Spain.|sd
I was born there.|sd
Were you?|bh
Yes|ny
How old were you when you left?|qw
Uh, just ten months.|sd
Oh, ten months,|b^m
uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
so, -|%
Have you ever got to go back?|qy
No,|nn
no,|nn
and I would like to.|sd
Would you?|bh
My, uh, my sister, -|%
we went with them to Germany|sd
and, uh, she would like to go to Spain.|sd
I'm not sure whether I would like to or not.|sd
Huh.|b
And, uh, I would like to go to Ireland.|sd
Would you?|bh
Uh-huh.|ny
Now, now I don't know if I'd like to go there just from --|sd
Well, the -- -|%
-- there is -- -|%
-- uh-huh,|b
is, is a little scary,|sv
but I would still like to see it.|sd
I'd like to see, uh, Italy.|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
yeah.|b
I would love to go there.|sd
That would be nice.|ba
And, course, there is a lot of places in the United States I still want to come, you know, go to.|sd
Now, have you been to Yellowstone?|qy
Uh,|%
Yellowstone,|sd
Yes,|ny
yes.|ny
Have you?|qy
We have been there.|na
We, I was there as a child and then we, we went to California and came back through Yellowstone with our kids.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they loved it.|sd
Well,|%
I was in Utah, in Salt Lake City when I was a, uh, youngster.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
So, uh, you know, I've touched on that.|sd
Yeah,|b
now I'm just about, oh, a half hour, uh, north of Salt Lake.|sd
Oh.|b
So, uh, it's at -- -|%
Yeah.|b
-- my husband works in Salt Lake,|sd
so -- -|%
Uh-huh.|b
-- we're real close|sd
and, yeah,|%
we, -|%
Now that's a pretty city.|sv
Yes,|aa
we, we like it.|sd
Very clean.|sd
Yeah.|b
It is.|sd
Utah is a pretty state from what I remember of it.|sd
Well, we kind of like it|sd
Uh-huh|b
Well, do you like to camp, those kind of trips?|qy
We, -|%
no,|nn
we used to|sd
We used to camp a lot with our -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, you like the motels?|qy
We like the motels,|na
yes|ny
Oh, oh, well.|%
We have, we've gone past the camping stage.|sd
We lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee for two years.|sd
Oh, did you?|bh
And we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys|sd
and it was beautiful|sd
and our kids loved it and everything|sd
and then we moved to, uh, uh, the Dallas area --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, it's hot down here|sd
and camping is not near as much fun.|sd
Oh.|b
And, uh, so, and then the kids were getting older and, and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside.|sd
Huh.|b
and, uh, and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, I am new to Texas,|sd
so I don't even know what the law is,|sd
Uh-huh?|bh
do you?|bh
Well, yes,|ny
of course, we do have capital punishment.|sd
And we've, you know, done away with our, quote, fair share number.|sd
Oh, that's right,|ba
I think now, that I recall, reading about it in the paper.|sd
Yes.|b
Um, you know, different things, -|%
is it restricted to certain crimes?|qy
Or just, -|%
Yes,|ny
it's certain crimes, uh, capital crimes, murder, of course, uh, rape,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um. Well. -|%
It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.|sv
Yes,|b
I know,|sv
the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been there, are going to be killed. Um, there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent|sv
and, they want, -|%
I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
I just, -|%
I can't see that.|sd
That happens on occasion,|sv
it sure does,|sv
maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You know, I don't know,|h
or a person personally. -|sv
No.|ar
I think I would be, you know, -|sv
I guess, really if I had to say yes or no, I guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death penalty,|sd
I don't know that it's a big deterrent really.|sv
I don't know that it is.|sv
I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or not.|sv
Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it kee-, -|sv
Oh, yeah,|aa
oh, absolutely,|aa
yeah,|aa
it goes on for years and years, and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.|sv
Ye-,|%
it's really sad.|sv
Yeah.|b
I don't know,|sd
I just think, um, -|sv
somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than, than, um, expecting,|sd
Yes.|b
with, -|%
someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know.|sv
Is really kind of bad|sv
Yes|aa
it is.|sv
It's a tough, tough question.|sv
It really is.|sv
I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that.|sv
Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.|sv
and there really are criminals that are hard-core and,|sv
Oh, absolutely.|aa
Tha-, that's right.|ba
Oh, I don't know,|h
is it, -|%
do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue?|qy
Not with me personally.|ng
It is with a lot of other people.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It's not, not to me personally,|sd
no.|ny
Um.|%
No.|ny
I don't know,|h
sometimes I feel, -|%
I mean I do go to church and things.|sd
I don't know how I would feel about it.|sd
But like you say, if it hit you personally,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
That's a, it's a tough, tough question,|sv
it really is.|sv
Do you think most states have that|qy
or? -|%
Yes,|ny
I think most states do have capital punishment.|sd
Yes.|ny
But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.|sv
That still does it,|bf
that's right.|ba
Yes,|aa
they're only, -|%
I was reading something about it the other day,|sd
I think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have capital punishment still.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
A lot of them had to have el-, elected not to do so.|sv
Now I don't know, what they do in place of it.|sd
You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you know, something,|sv
I don-, I don't know how they handle it|sd
bu-, I was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.|sd
Have that. -|bf
Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, uh, are really, I mean, -|sv
there's a lot of people that are on death row.|sv
Oh, yes.|b
Yes,|aa
a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
So, it seems like a of people live there,|sv
and then through appeals. -|sv
Yes.|b
Because I know they do frequently, -|sv
I mean they cover, cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yes.|b
If it finally gets to that point.|sd
Right,|b
the first appeal is automatic,|sv
so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.|sv
Yeah.|b
There's, there's a lot of, you know, last minute, uh, things that happen cause a person not to,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So is it, uh, -|%
are we doing lethal injection now?|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
That's, that's fairly recent, I don't know, how recent, but fairly recent, in the state of Texas.|sd
Before that, it was, uh, death by electrocution.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
wh-, which seems so awful.|sv
Yes,|aa
it certainly does.|sd
So, it's a little bit more humane,|sv
I guess, it is, -|sv
Yes,|aa
it would almost have to be, I suppose.|sv
If you, if you had to chose, I guess I would, I am sure I would take the lethal injection.|sv
Yes,|aa
the other one just seems so terrible.|sv
Yes,|aa
absolutely.|aa
Um.|%
It's a, it's a tough question.|sv
It really is.|sv
I guess, if I had to say yes or no, I would say, you know, yes.|sd
I, I would have to lean toward capital punishment, you know, for certain crimes.|sd
Well, do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime|qy
or, it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison?|qrr
No,|nn
I don't think it's a monetary thing.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think, -|%
we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of determ-, deterrent or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like that.|sv
Um.|%
Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless.|sv
This may seem to be the best way out.|sv
I don't know.|h
Yes.|b
Easiest way out maybe.|bf
No,|nn
I don't think it's a monetary thing.|sv
Um. Well, um, and I notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area|sd
It's,|sv
Yes,|b
especially the murder rate, its just gone crazy.|sd
Yes.|b
and,|sd
Absolutely.|aa
Yes,|aa
I wish I had the answer for that,|sd
everybody does.|sv
You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the,|sv
Yes,|aa
it's nothing to be proud of,|sv
certainly not.|sv
But I, you know, -|%
we have been really fortunate|sd
our family,|sd
Yes.|b
Yes,|b
so have we been very, very fortunate.|sd
And, so we don't, -|%
it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way.|sv
That's right.|ba
Absolutely.|aa
And how they would expect,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I mean you, you hear of people who have, um, committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the same thing again.|sv
Absolutely.|b
And you wonder why they can't just stop it.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That's right.|ba
So, maybe you would, -|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.|sd
So would I, -|aa
I fortunately, I have never been in that circumstance,|sd
I hope I never am, like, like everybody else.|sd
No,|aa
I know when, um, -|%
we just, we moved here, uh, I from the, I got a summons, jury summons,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
just like constantly, it seemed like,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
but fortunately I had small children|sd
and I didn't have to go.|sd
Right.|b
And it's not that,|sv
I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the jury,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
it's just that, I didn't, -|sd
I hate having to be in charge of someone else's life.|sd
Sure,|aa
it's, it's a big responsibility,|sv
it really is.|sv
And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case,|sd
Yes.|b
So would I.|sd
That would be really awful.|ba
Yes.|aa
Absolutely.|aa
Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, uh, talking to you about this. Although it has been difficult|sd
but, uh. -|%
It is, it's a tough subject,|sv
it really is.|sv
I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important,|sv
Right.|b
That's right.|ba
Anyway, well, you have a good day.|fc
Well, thank you,|fc
it's nice talking to you.|fc
Thank you,|fc
bye-bye.|fc
Uh-huh.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
wow, I don't know what that was.|sd
What was that?|qw
I don't know|sd
And, uh, to, uh, the Brazos River --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, yes.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh, we have not camped in any of those places,|sd
in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped,|sd
but we used to go to Tyler State Park and, uh, Daingerfield|sd
and in Texas that is where we camp basically. Uh,|sd
What are they like?|qo
They are very nice.|sd
Tyler is really, really a neat place to camp.|sd
It has a nice little lake|sd
and it has some really wonderful, uh, sights that are in the wooded areas.|sd
Uh, the facilities are quite nice|sd
and our children liked, liked it quite well.|sd
and you know they, -|%
we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area.|sd
And, uh, it was just, it was just a really nice place to camp.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, now Daingerfield is, -|%
let's see,|^h
I think that's a little bit mor-, more east, further east, and and maybe south, if I am remembering where that is.|sv
No,|ar
I think it's a little bit further north, when I think about it.|sv
At any rate it was, it was very nice as well.|sd
But Tyler, we sort of got spoiled with, I think.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, we had lived in Michigan before we came here and, uh, had done a lot of camping in Michigan,|sd
I think the upper peninsula of Michigan, especially, -|sd
and then also, we had done some camping in Colorado, in the mountains,|sd
so, uh, my parents were real avid campers|sd
and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well.|sd
So I guess we just kind of came by it naturally|sd
Yeah.|b
Do you have a large tent|qy
or, -|%
Yeah,|ny
it was a nine by twelve.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And how many does it sleep, uh, comfortably?|qw
Well, there, well supposedly, -|sv
they always say it sleeps more than it does.|sv
Right|b
But th-, they, -|%
it would have slept three adults anyway.|sd
Yeah,|b
Yeah.|b
Well, sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger, uh, we invested in some stacking, uh, cots, you know, that were like bunk, bunk beds,|sd
but they were cots, fold up cots.|sd
That really gave us a lot more space, um, floor space and, so, you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around|sd
and, -|%
Right.|b
uh, gave us a place to stack things during the day|sd
so that was real nice.|sd
But, uh, we, uh, -|%
like, my in-laws also had a camper, or, uh, a pop up tent, you know, one of those trailer tops|sd
and those are really nice too.|sd
A little more, uh, luxurious, so to speak, but not much|sd
Di-, do they have a kitchen in them?|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
It's really nice,|sd
in fact, it even had, had a little refrigerator, uh, and the whole business.|sd
It was quite nice in that respect.|sd
Uh, and everything was very convenient|sd
and you did not have to, to be hauling things out of your, the trunk of you car,|sd
Trunk of your car all time, right.|^2
and that was nice.|sd
So, uh, do you have plans for, for any other camping trips in the near future?|qy
Uh, maybe, uh, maybe back to Caddo, or,|na
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Or, I like Bob Sandlin too,|sd
it's a new park.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And there is, uh, not really camping,|sd
but, uh,|%
what is it called, Cedar Hill.|sd
Right.|b
Lake Joe Pool.|sd
Oh, yes.|b
And sometime, I like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma.|sd
Yes,|aa
yes,|aa
I have been in that area.|sd
That is a really pretty state park.|sv
Uh, just, -|%
we did not camp there,|sd
but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area|sd
and it's real lovely.|sv
It's close to the lake and close to, -|sd
I think it's close to the dam up there|sd
so it's, it's really quite pretty.|sv
Uh, are you, um, -|qy
let's see what was, -|^h
I was going to ask you something else.|^h
Oh, do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to?|qy
Oh, fr-, from those three, -|^h
just, just, uh, from when I have been an adult, I like Caddo the best.|na
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
Uh, is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas?|qy
Yeah,|ny
that's right.|sd
I, I would,|%
I have never been there|sd
and I would love to see what it looks like|sd
It's not, it's not very deep.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they did build a dam on it,|sd
but it was there before they built the dam.|sd
It has been there for a hundred years.|sd
Oh, I see.|b
Apparently, an earth quake caused it.|sv
How interesting.|ba
Yeah.|b
I guess I never heard the history of that.|sd
Huh, well, that might be some place where my husband and I can go.|sd
We are talking about starting camping again in the fall.|sd
Um, our children are both grown|sd
and, and so, it's just pretty much the two of us who do things.|sd
And so, uh, we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to, to go to and see what it looks like.|sd
Yeah,|b
it's really nice.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
And I, I don't know,|h
probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas.|sv
Is it?|bh
Uh, yeah,|aa
I think so.|sv
Especially with, uh, uh, -|%
when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty,|sv
Right.|b
especially in East Texas, it's really nice.|sv
So, uh, well, I, um, I have enjoyed talking with you.|fc
It was nice talking to you.|fc
And, um, have, uh, some happy camping trips|fc
Hope you get to those places you have talked about.|fc
Yeah,|fc
you too.|fc
Well, okay,|fc
thanks.|fc
Bye,|fc
Uh-huh,|fc
bye-bye.|fc
Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Yes.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Uh, well, right now we have one dog inside.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
She goes out|sd
but I mean she's an indoor dog.|sd
Yes.|b
And two outside cats. -|sd
Oh, gosh.|ba
Male and female.|sd
And how long have you had them?|qw
The ma-, -|%
the dog is probably about, about thirteen, fourteen years old.|sd
And the cats are, they might be as old.|sd
I'm not sure|sd
Yeah.|aa
Well, that's interesting because we have a simi-, -|sv
we don't have cats|sd
but we do have a dog,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and she is going to be thirteen this summer|sd
so, -|%
Oh, is that right?|qy
What kind of dog do you have?|qw
Um, she's, um, a mix of Cockapoo, Cock-, Cocker Spaniel and Poodle.|sd
Oh, that's what ours is|sd
Is that right?|qy
Yes.|ny
Isn't that interesting|bh
What color is your dog?|qw
White.|sd
Oh, well, ours is black,|sd
so -|%
Oh, uh-huh.|b
definitely different|sd
I'll be darned.|ba
Yes,|b
she's a female|sd
and she's, um, been, she's been a really, a really good companion for me.|sd
Um,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
Yeah.|b
and, and, um, she's slowing down considerably.|sd
She doesn't hear very well|sd
and, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
she doesn't see very well|sd
but she's, -|%
Well, that's to be expected at,|sv
Yeah,|b
at this age, I guess so.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, um, she's been a good dog to have,|sd
and I don't know,|sd
once she's gone, I'm not sure if I'll get another animal or not|sd
Well, everybody always says no more|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
But I, I think animals are really important in the family.|sv
I, -|%
I agree,|aa
yes.|aa
Um, did you get yours as a pet for your chil-,|qy
do you have children?|qy
Uh, yeah,|ny
we,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Oh. Well, I was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before|qy^d
or, -|%
Well, we have had, we had had, a, a dog before.|sd
She was fifteen when she died.|sd
My goodness.|ba
And, uh, this one, we bought by accident,|sd
Uh.|%
a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to co-, or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
people drop things like that off,|sv
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
and I said, "Gee, she sounds like a cute little dog."|sd
I told the kids, "Let's go look at her"|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
Go get her.|^q
So that's how we got her,|sd
Isn't that, -|b
Yes.|b
So that often happens that way.|sv
Well, we had, um, intentionally, um, planned to get a dog.|sd
We had just moved into this house and, um, decided to wait about a year and then went,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
she was in the litter,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
and, um, she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy.|sd
I mean, they were all over the place,|sd
and she was real docile and,|sd
Oh.|b
and I thought,|sd
Oh.|b
She picked us|^q
Yeah,|b
so she, -|%
and it, -|%
what was funny was that, um, our daughter must have been, -|sd
let's see,|^h
she must have been about eight at the time, I guess,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, um, she just loved this little dog,|sd
Oh.|b
but I think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her.|sd
I think,|sv
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, um, not very interested in pets,|sd
but as it turned out, he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals.|sd
Oh, for heaven's sake.|ba
So you just never know how that works out|sv
No.|aa
But they say it's real important for children to have pets because, uh, well, they can go and talk to them any time,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yes.|b
they want to and tell them anything they want to|sv
and,|sv
Yeah.|b
That's right.|ba
or -|%
That, -|%
yes,|b
they're very,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yes|b
Oh, dear|ba
And the nursing homes now, they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home.|sv
Yes,|b
I have been, I have been reading and seeing about that on television.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
and how, -|%
Our one, our one nursing home in has one.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Permanent|sd
Is that right?|qy
He, he kind of has free run of the place, and there is some-, or somebody takes care of him.|na
Isn't that amazing?|bh
But he goes out people,|sv
and real nice dog, uh,|sv
and, uh, -|%
Uh-huh,|b
yes.|b
It's funny how, um, how pets can kind of, um, oh, take on a certain status in certain areas.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I mean, um, that made me think of, uh, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, um, Saint Louis|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and,|%
Oh, really?|bh
what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly,|sd
but they didn't appear to belong to anyone.|sd
And, um,|sd
Oh.|b
They were healthy,|sd
Yeah.|b
But, um, our guide that day said that the la- , one woman many, many years ago had given a huge sum of money to, to the university, on the condition that there be, um, dogs just kind of left to roam aro-, around the campus.|sd
Is that right?|bh
Yeah|b
because most campuses don't allow pets,|sv
I know.|b
they just do not allow them.|sv
Yes,|aa
I know.|sv
That's, that's kind of great.|sv
Yes,|aa
it really was.|sv
It was just a nice touch,|sd
Yeah.|b
and it kind of made it seem more homey too|sv
Yes,|b
yeah.|b
But, um, th-, -|%
I thought that was most unique.|sv
And it just, you know, kind of goes along with what you were saying,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So, um, but, uh, I, -|%
this is the only pet we've had sin-,|sd
Um.|%
in all our years of marriage, um, -|sd
and it's been, uh, sort of a, a change for my husband because as a, a, a boy growing up, his father had dogs|sd
but they were always hunting dogs,|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
and so they were never allowed in the house, you know,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
they were always kind of, -|sd
Yeah,|b
we've ruined them|sv
Yeah,|b
right.|b
That's what he said.|sd
They say ruined them|sv
Yes.|b
So having a pet was a little bit different for him.|sd
Well, we've had a lot of different pets.|sd
We had, the kids had rabbits for pets,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and we also raised them for food,|sd
Yeah,|b
Oh, yes.|b
And we've had it . We've had a skunk for a pet.|sd
Oh, my golly.|ba
She was in the house|sd
Oh, gosh.|ba
Isn't that interesting?|bh
I don't think I've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet.|sd
Well, do-, don't ever get one for a pet.|ad
Oh.|b
They're okay,|sd
but like she, uh, -|%
they don't ever learn their name.|sd
Oh.|b
Uh, you can't, you could never call her and she would come to you,|sd
Yeah.|b
you had to go chase her down.|sd
I'll be darned.|ba
How interesting.|ba
And, uh, their eyesight, they can't see very far either.|sd
But, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
I guess I've heard that, uh-huh.|sd
They, -|%
be-, before we got her, everybody said, "Oh, they're just like a cat," you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, they're not|sd
I mean, they use the litter box.|sd
That's about it .|sd
Isn't that interesting?|bh
That's, that's really something.|ba
Um, how long did you have that?|qw
Oh, my, how, how long?|bf
Probably seven or eight years.|sd
Goodness sake.|ba
And finally, my children are the ones who said, "Mom, you've put up with that skunk long enough,"|sd
so,|sd
and I don't think she was there a week till the men moved her, buil-, built her a pen outside|sd
Oh, my gosh.|ba
Isn't that funny?|bh
And I thought, I put up with that all those years|sd
Yes,|b
and this is what it took finally|bf
And,|sd
That is, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Uh, one of them ran off.|sd
She ran off once,|sd
or he, I guess it was a male, he ran off twice,|sd
and the second time he never came back.|sd
My goodness.|ba
And we would see him, uh, several miles from our house,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
he kind of moved into a woods down there.|sd
I'll be.|ba
And he got huge down there.|sd
My goodness.|ba
He really grew|sd
but he,|sd
That's in-,|ba
I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat.|sv
Well, he wasn't a whole lot.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
He was in the house most the time,|sd
Yeah.|b
but, uh, he did go out sometimes|sd
and, uh, they ma-, -|%
it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside.|sd
Is that right?|qy
Yeah.|ny
The, the cats, -|%
my son has a cat,|sd
and the vet had told us they get strange,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And their cat was not a friendly cat,|sd
it was,|sd
Well. -|%
I don't know,|sd
it got, -|%
it was just, did get strange|sd
Yeah,|b
so that that was right.|sv
And since they've moved to where they are, they let the cat out. -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it has improved the personality.|sd
What do you do there in Lubbock as far as, uh, recycling is concerned?|qw
Well, you know they actually started|sd
and I assumed it was T I wide, uh,|sv
they, they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- uh, I've you know -|%
either computer paper or different types of paper.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I've had some ideas on how I think they could probably do it a little less expensively and accomplish the same purpose,|sd
but I, I guess I need to put it on paper and turn it in|sv
Oh, yeah.|b
Wha-, --|qw
Uh.|%
Wha-, what, -|%
Well, the way they have, you know, they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module, or down the hall|sd
or --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
You know, where I use to work we had what we called tree boxes.|sd
That's just what we called them.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they were recycled cardboard.|sd
They were eight and a half by eleven|sd
and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there|sd
and when it filled up you called, you know facilities whoever to come pick it up|sd
and they brought you another box.|sd
So not only is it, you know, -|sd
I think more people would take advantage of it and use it, uh,|sv
I think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to, to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step --|sv
Oh.|b
I see.|b
So, -|%
Yeah,|b
I, I, I, uh, was going to say cause I know I have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it --|sd
Right.|b
and, uh, if --|sd
If. -|%
Right,|b
but somebody still has to collect all that --|sd
That's true.|ba
and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full, you close the box, it's already bundled, it's already done for you.|sd
Certainly that's a good idea.|ba
So you're saving a lot of time and effort.|sv
I just need to put it on paper and --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So, uh, what else do they do in the Dallas area?|qo
Well, uh, as far as T I is concerned, I'm not sure.|sd
Uh, and I have heard, you know, uh, in residential situations. -|sd
I live in a dorm|sd
and I have heard in residential situations, uh, like in Plano --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um.|%
and, uh, the only responsibility of the, of the, patron is to separate them|sd
and then the, the, -|%
uh, I guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them|sv
and it doesn't cost the patron anything.|sd
Doesn't really cost the, uh, department.|sd
Anything extra.|^2
Right.|aa
They don't pay, they don't pay for the recycled items.|sd
That sounds good.|ba
There's, -|%
I, I've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where, you know, from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other|sd
or the, the even, uh, -|%
there are areas that can recycle the, the tin cans, like your --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, so I, I've not done that,|sd
but that's kind of what I want to set up so. Because we do go through aluminum cans, you know.|sd
That's probably the one we use most.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, but, -|%
Well, wh-, what kind of services do you have there in Lubbock as far as, -|qw
I, I lived in Abilene for a, uh, -|sd
I went to school there at Abilene Christian|sd
and I, -|%
it was so hard to, uh, -|sd
you know if you --|sv
Find a place.|^2
Well, uh, uh they, they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers, aluminum cans, those are the two major items.|sd
You know, we can take oil, like car oil, recycled oil to, -|sd
they have, uh, uh, dump areas like at the fire departments --|sd
Um.|%
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, I think they can do the plastics, like the liter bottles --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, but, I, I don't know.|h
I know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, -|%
Well, that's good.|sv
I do that -|sd
I think people are becoming more aware.|sv
Yeah.|b
and you know I, I like to see, you know, -|%
you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and you know, so, you know I feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it.|sv
You know, maybe it's making an impact|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Do you tend to buy more recycled items that, if something, uh, the pack says recycled and something else doesn't?|qy
Do, -|%
would you tend to chose the one that does|qy
or, -|%
I'm not as good about searching something out like that --|ng
Uh-huh.|b
-- but if I am there and the choice is there --|sd
Um.|%
Uh-huh.|b
So, you know, that's just where I probably need to be a little more responsible, citizen wise, you know, looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way.|sv
Sure,|b
yeah.|b
So, uh, you know, they are getting away from the styrofoam,|sd
Well a lot of women are knowl-, as knowledge about football as I am.|sv
Can I guess your favorite team, if you had one, might be the Steelers.|qy
Yes,|ny
uh-huh.|ny
Well, I can understand that.|sd
I, you know, I kind of like the Cowboys, too.|sd
Do you?|qy
They've had some great games in the past.|na
Uh-huh,|b
I, I always enjoy watching the stal-, the, Dallas and Pittsburgh together.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
me too.|aa
It wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys, I'll tell you.|sv
He lives in the Dallas area now, as a matter of fact.|sd
Does he really?|qy
Well, actually, it's probably closer to Fort Worth,|sd
but it's, it's in the same area.|sd
He bought, uh, bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke, Texas.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often.|sd
As a matter of fact, there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job.|sd
Oh, wo-, -|ba
I wonder if he'd ever do that.|qy^d
I don't know,|no
he'd be good at it.|sv
He's such a motivator, he,|sv
Yes.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
That would be his specialty.|sv
I wished, I wished they could work something,|sv
I really like him.|sd
I really do.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well what about the Houston Oilers.|qo
Do you like them?|qy
Yeah,|ny
okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl.|sd
That would be really great.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
That may not ever happen,|sv
I don't know.|h
Uh, Houston has had some wonderful talent, you know, down through the years|sv
and in the earlier years they really had some super teams.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And Warren Moon,|sv
That's right.|ba
He certainly is,|aa
he's very good.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
He's very good.|sv
He's one of the few, uh, Black quarterbacks that there are.|sv
That's right.|aa
Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia, I guess last year,|sv
but he's no longer with the team.|sd
So, you're right,|sv
there are very few Black quarterbacks, or at least that are starting anyway.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
How do you think the Steelers are going to do this year.|qo
You have any idea.|qy
I don't know,|no
I hope they, they do better.|sv
They, they -|%
during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, I think they still have a little, I think they're still such a, a young team I think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential,|sv
Yeah.|b
Oh, yeah,|b
that was just such super team.|sv
Or, if they even reach that potential again, you know, they may never reach that again.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well that's a tough, -|ba
it would be tough to do,|sv
it really would.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
They have such a super team for years, that won what, four Super Bowls?|qy^d
Yeah,|ny
four in a row.|sd
Four in a row.|sd
I don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not.|sd
Oh, I don't know.|sd
Yeah.|b
Shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying.|sd
That's right|ba
And, -|%
But basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now,|sd
so. -|%
That's right.|ba
I think Mike Webster was left|sv
but then he, he just left.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
Uh.|%
He may have been the last of the old guard,|sv
I don't know.|h
Yeah,|aa
I think he is,|sv
I think he was.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|b
they had such a super team.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday?|qy
No,|nn
I didn't.|sd
I see.|bk
Huh-uh.|b
There's quite a bit of activity now,|sv
of course they had so many, you know, nice, uh, choices because their record was so lousy the last few years.|sv
They picked up,|sd
Uh.|%
of course you never know.|sv
The guys they pick, you know, m-, may never play a game.|sv
You jus-, never know,|sv
it's, it's a gamble,|sv
it really is.|sv
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
They may get hurt, or, not be able to participate at that level, if you know, -|sd
Well who would you say is your favorite player, or has ever been your favorite player?|qw
Ever been?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Probably an old guy that played, probably before you were born|sd
his name was Sam Huff.|sd
He used to play for the New York Giants.|sd
Oh.|b
That was one of the toughest guys that I've ever seen in my life,|sd
Really.|b
He just went all out every single play.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Of course, there have been some other great ones too, Dick Butkis, and Bradshaw, you know,|sv
there's been so many.|sv
Yeah,|b
ye-, -|%
But if I had to pick one, I would probably pick Sam Huff, as a matter of fact.|sd
Oh, you know, that's really funny, um,|sv
well, I, I come from a large family|sd
and, the-, there's quite a few boys|sd
so that's kind of how I got in with the football.|sd
Either watch that or watch nothing.|sd
That's right.|b
And, um, at one time I could name all the players on the Steelers, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, but, even when Bradshaw was playing, I, I don't know, I, I didn't particularly care for him,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I thought he was kind of cocky or something.|sd
He is,|sv
he is,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
of course the-, a quarterback has a big ego.|sv
Yeah,|b
uh-huh.|b
They really d-, they have to have,|sv
they can't survive.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
They always think they can win, you know, which is the way it should be.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Boy, he never gave up, I'll tell you.|sd
Yeah|b
him and Franco Harris,|sd
I really didn't care for the either two of them.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh,|b
I mean they were good,|sv
but, I, you know, you couldn't deny that.|sv
Oh yeah.|b
But I didn't, I thought, you know, well I just didn't really care for either one of them.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, today, my favorites out of those guys were probably, um, Lambert,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
absolutely,|aa
I can't disagree with that.|aa
They were super players,|sv
they really were.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
They really, -|%
I, I, I like, not just with the Pittsburgh, I like watching on Saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or the, the best plays from,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
highlights, yeah.|sd
Yeah,|b
I love watching that.|sd
Then I like watching their bloopers too, you know|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
that's kind of funny too, as a matter of fact|sv
Some of them a, a bit embarrassing.|sv
Yeah,|%
well they make mistakes too, I guess.|sv
Yeah,|b
uh-huh,|b
Absol-, -|%
it's funny that more people don't get hurt.|sv
Absolutely.|aa
Uh-huh,|b
oh they,|%
Oh, yeah,|aa
it's funny some of their necks don't get broken.|sv
Absolutely,|aa
I don't know how they do it.|sd
It's, it must just take a hundred percent concentration, I guess, because they know they're going to get hit,|sv
it's just a matter of how hard, you know, or where.|sv
Yeah.|b
An they have to be in ideal physical shape, basically.|sv
Oh, absolutely.|aa
They look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem.|sv
Gosh, what a beating, -|sv
they really do take a beating,|sv
they really do.|sv
Yeah.|b
Well what did you think of, um. a couple years ago for the Bears, the Refrigerator.|qo
I think he was just probably a passing phenomena, I think|sv
I don't know,|h
I, I'm knowing what, you know, -|%
of course, Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach, is knowing his, or, you know, knowing of his temperament, I'm just surprised he ever, you know, kept the guy around,|sv
I really am.|sv
He's such a, he's about a half hot head anyway, such a temper.|sv
Oh, you know, and to me he does, um, oh, he's just so big and fat,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
he doesn't even look like he's in shape.|sv
He's just so big, no one can move him.|sv
That's right, yeah,|ba
absolutely.|aa
There's just so much mass there, I guess they just can't, -|sv
I don't know, you know,|h
I, -|%
probably the guy is, you know, probably physically strong.|sv
I, you know, -|%
obviously not very fast.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But I guess it's just, like you say, a mass that nobody can seem t-, to get out of the way.|sv
As far as him scoring touch downs, you know, I think that was kind of weird.|sv
I don't know,|h
Dallas has a guy, uh, his name is Nate Newton,|sd
now he has a real weight problem too.|sv
He fights it every single year,|sv
but, he manages to still keep playing,|sd
but,|sv
Yeah.|b
Wow.|ba
They wa-, -|%
the coaches watch him all year long.|sd
They, they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not, you know, completely out of control.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But I guess most every team has so-, has someone like that,|sv
I don't, -|%
Oh, yeah,|b
there's, there are some really big guys playing in football.|sv
Absolutely they get bigger and bigger, it seems every year.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I guess you have to to, you know, to stay in the game I guess.|sv
Yeah,|b
you would, uh-huh.|aa
Yeah.|b
Um, now who, -|%
would you say that you have a fav-, -|qy
I mean other than Dallas, would you say that you have, uh, a favorite quarterback.|qy
I mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the, the attention, you know.|sd
Oh, yeah,|ny
sure,|sd
well, you'd have to, uh, or I would have to say, you know, someone like Montana, I guess, who's done so well for so many years.|sv
Yeah,|b
I re-, I, I enjoy watching him play.|sd
Yeah,|b
his age is about to catch up with him though.|sv
He's no Spring chicken anymore.|sv
No,|b
but he's still performing.|sv
And like you say Warren Moon's an excellent,|sv
Warren Moon's an excellent. -|sv
But he's very exciting to watch.|sv
Yes he is,|aa
Uh-huh,|b
sure.|b
I, I, I enjoy watching him also.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
absolutely.|aa
What about, uh, Marino?|qo
Uh, I'm, -|%
obviously he's a very good quarterback,|h
I'd, I never was, you know, too, a whole lot of, a big fan, you know.|sd
Yeah,|b
he may, uh-huh.|sv
Yes|ny
he was,|sd
I believe that's right at one point in time.|sv
Ye-, -|%
but he's a very young fellow.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot, if he's got a good supporting cast, you know.|sv
That's true,|ba
that's true.|ba
If not, he gets beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway,|sv
you kno-, -|%
we-, -|%
Dallas did better last year,|sv
hopefully they'll do better this year.|sv
to someone else in the Uh, probably around twelve, uh-huh.|t3
Yeah,|b
uh, I didn't, I don't know,|h
I, I just think, you know Marino will get better|sv
and, uh, his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl,|sv
That's right.|ba
so. -|%
Yeah,|b
Miami's had some down years, too.|sv
Yeah.|b
But they all do, I guess,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah|b
That's true,|ba
ye-, -|%
and with age comes,|sv
Yeah,|b
with -|%
yeah,|%
the, the -|%
I'm sure arthritis sets in with them,|sv
Oh yes, very much so.|aa
Hip injuries and things like that, yeah.|^2
Right,|b
yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
that, that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
and they're so young,|sv
That's right.|ba
but, they're retired, you know,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|b
I read some time, well not too long ago that the average, uh, professional career only lasts seven years.|sd
So that's when you think about it, that's really not a very long time, of course.|sv
Oh yeah,|b
but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that.|sv
But if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years, you know.|sd
Yeah,|b
a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple.|sd
that's ri-, -|%
Holy smokes, I didn't that doesn't seem like very long.|sv
That's, that's a pretty short career on average.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Of course they play their, you know, cards right and do some good investments, they'll, you know, they'll do all right.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But a lot of them don't, unfortunately.|sv
Yeah.|b
Um, what do you think of the, uh, L A Raiders,|qo
used to the, the Oakland? -|qy
Yeah,|ny
they, they're always branded, you know, as a bunch of outlaws|sv
and,|sv
But that just may be, you know, perceived, -|sv
you know perception, -|sv
I don't know.|h
Yeah.|b
Al Davis is, he's a kind of strange character, strange, strange looking guy.|sv
Apparently he's kind of a wild guy,|sv
I don't really know for sure.|h
They've had some excellent teams, though, obviously.|sv
Yes,|aa
they have.|sv
I'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play,|sv
they keeping talk about, you know, going, -|sv
There you go.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Uh-huh.|b
Well, Jean, the subject is jury trials|sd
and should the jury recommend, uh, sentencing.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Now my personal opinion, -|sd
I don't know.|h
Uh, uh, here lately it seems, -|sv
well up until a few years ago, I guess, there just too many liberals about and permitting too many, oh, -|sv
they just broaden the human rights to, to cover just about ev-, everybody, and I don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It's just not right.|sv
I think I agree with that very much.|sv
And therefore --|sv
I, -|%
do you, -|qy
Do you think a lot of people, when they are listening to a trial, put themselves in a position like that and say, I would never do something like that,|qy
and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done?|qy
Yes,|ny
very possibly.|sd
So many of us have led sheltered lives --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I've never done it myself --|sd
I never have either.|sd
I wish I could have.|sd
I've just never been called up.|sd
My husband works as a police man,|sd
so I always assumed that that was why I was never called.|sd
Well now, that's possible.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But, uh, I was called up as an alternate once,|sd
but I --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, do they have such a thing now as a six man jury?|qy
Not that I know of.|ng
Somebody told me the other day that there is, what they call a six man jury,|sd
and I had never heard of such thing,|sd
and I wondered if it was true.|sd
Uh-huh|b
Uh, I've never heard of it.|sd
I never had either,|sd
but I just wondered. Uh, -|sd
another question was, should a criminal case, should the jury be unanimous on their decision,|sd
and that I wasn't sure on either, whether it should be unanimous or not.|sd
Uh, well, there again, uh, I suppose it should be.|sv
That would mean they all would have to decide --|qy^d
Exactly.|na
Is it guilt or innocence.|^2
But then again, so many times you get one or two holdouts,|sv
and, and --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
And there, -|%
that's not too bad in this sense, because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- I mean, that's happened --|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Bring some of these things out.|^2
Yes.|aa
Uh-huh.|b
We can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials.|sv
Un, apparently there are.|sv
I, I, I, -|%
since my husband worked as a policeman, I can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have, are not guilty of something --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
I have, I still have a little bit of a problem with that.|sd
Uh, but, I would suppose there are circumstances, you're in the wrong place at the right time, or know the wrong person at the right time.|sv
Oh, that's it,|ba
and you just might resemble somebody.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, out here in Texas we had a, a, a, great miscarriage of justice.|sd
It was finally, after nine years, it was finally, uh, taken care of.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We had, -|%
a Black man was accused simply because he resembled --|sd
Oh.|b
uh-huh.|b
And even though he had witnesses that said that, uh, he was at work,|sd
and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not,|sd
They still found him guilty?|qy^d
They found him guilty.|na
When people said he was at work?|qy^d
Well, they said it w-, this, this happened during lunch time.|na
Uh-huh.|b
And he could have disap-, gotten away at lunch time --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
But after nine years, -|sd
well as a matter of fact they made a T V show about it, after nine years, they finally came up with evidence and proved, to prove that he was innocent.|sd
Oh, for heaven's sake.|ba
So there's nine years of that man's life gone.|sd
Exactly.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Now that just was not fair.|sv
No,|aa
huh-uh.|b
So. -|%
Yeah,|b
I guess that's where a lot of the problem lies,|sv
we're, we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people, the one's that are on trial.|sv
Yes.|b
And,|sv
Unfortunately, that's what happens.|sv
Well, it's not, the, uh, uh, it's not the best system,|sv
but it's the best one in the world.|sv
Yeah,|b
it's the best one that exists, I guess.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And unfortunately, we just have to put up with a lot of things,|sv
and they try to solve them and everything,|sv
but, uh, I don't know,|h
the Supreme Court, -|%
well, I'm, I'm, I'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag.|sd
Oh, I think a lot of people are.|sv
I think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country.|sv
Well, it, -|%
the, the, the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
And, uh, uh, well that just rancles me|sd
no,|%
I swear, if I ever saw somebody to, uh, burning a flag, I'd, I'd try to kill them, I would.|sd
That bad, huh.|b
I wouldn't like it,|sd
but I don't know if I'd go that far.|sv
Well, I happen to be a flag freak.|sd
I served, I was in the service --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- I was in Korea --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, well, I saw what the red in the flag represents.|sd
Yeah,|b
well, I think pride in our country and our flag is so important.|sv
It's important in so many facets of our lives.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, I, I feel like if they don't, people don't like what our flag stands for, they're welcome to go some place else.|sv
Yeah,|b
see what they, -|%
There's nobody holding them here.|sv
See how they'd like it under another flag.|sv
Right.|b
They'd soon be back,|sv
I'm sure.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Well, Jean, we seem to be of the same opinions here.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I hope they get something out of this.|sd
Yeah,|b
I don't know about the judge making the decision, if that's, -|sv
do you think that's good --|qy
Oh --|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
but I think the jury should be able to recommend,|sv
Make a recommendation?|qy^d
Yes.|ny
Do they sometimes make a recommendation?|qy
Oh, yes,|ny
yes.|ny
That's what I was thinking they, they sometimes do.|sd
I don't know if that's a regular procedure or what.|sd
But I know I'm always hearing that, uh,|sd
well, the jury came in with a guilty verdict|sd
and they recommended,|sd
And they recommend.|^2
Yeah.|b
And then the judge has the final decision --|sd
Yes.|b
Of course, now, the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
They may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five.|sd
Well, I think that's where a lot of people think, boy they're getting put away for a long time,|sv
but actually, their chance, course, when, -|sv
a lot of times when they come up for parole, they're denied.|sv
It depends on --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
but too many times they, they are permitted to go out on parole|sv
and, -|%
Uh-huh.|b
A lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do.|sv
And there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again.|sv
Yes.|b
They just go out and repeat their crimes.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Well there, -|%
well, they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison,|sd
but I think they ought to make it two offenses.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I always thought there was, there was wrong, -|sv
it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
It seemed like there, sometimes there's not a good, -|sv
the balance isn't right.|sv
It doesn't make sense.|sv
Yeah,|b
very true.|ba
Well, here again now, there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Race or nationality even.|sv
Uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
But, uh, like you said, it's, it's not the best system,|sv
but it's the best one we've got.|sv
Yeah,|b
right.|b
So, let's put up with it, I guess.|%
Uh-huh.|b
Improve it if we can, if we ever get a chance.|sv
Sure enough.|ba
So. -|%
Jean, it's been awful nice talking to you.|fc
Well, it's been nice talking to you, Jack,|fc
and I hope you have a real good day and week.|fc
Well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing.|fc
I hope not.|fc
Take care now.|fc
You, too.|fc
Bye.|fc
Bye-bye.|fc
All right,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?|qw
Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool|sd
and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy.|sd
It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I like that.|sd
Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it|sd
and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,|sd
but I just use those little cans of chicken.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And it makes it so much easier,|sd
and so you dump the rice,|sd
you dump the chicken|sd
and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,|sd
now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off,|sd
but I get my kids to do that,|sd
so, -|%
Oh|sd
I, I don't have to do that.|sd
And, um, and it really, -|%
and you mix it all up with ye-, -|sd
there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up,|sd
but it's so simple|sd
and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime.|sd
Oh, yeah.|b
You serve it cold?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
Oh, yeah,|bk
that sounds good.|ba
Yeah,|b
it has to sit in the fridge over night,|sd
but, but it's really good.|sv
Um.|%
And I like that one.|sd
Yeah.|b
Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company,|sd
Yeah.|b
so,|sd
Exactly.|b
like, uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over|sd
and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh, that sounds good.|ba
And tha-, it was real good.|sd
You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way|sd
and then people think they're eating steak or something|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah|b
And these days that helps, doesn't it?|qy
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
It really does.|sd
I know what you mean.|sd
I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.|sd
Now spaghetti's such an easy one.|sd
Um, I do that a lot.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I do spaghetti a lot.|sd
Yeah,|b
it seems like most people like spaghetti.|sd
Yeah,|b
I don't like to do that i-, if it's ho-, real hot though.|sd
Yeah.|b
Because, um, I don't know,|h
I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I guess.|b
Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference,|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|aa
I think that's right.|sv
And, um, we don't entertain that often,|sd
but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Most, -|%
we don't entertain like people from work or stuff e-, often.|sd
It's usually friends from church and stuff,|sd
Yeah.|b
and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring.|sd
Yeah.|b
And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things|sd
and everybody else brings something.|sd
That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it,|sd
yeah.|aa
Oh yeah,|ba
yeah.|b
Uh.|%
It's a lot more relaxing.|sd
I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to m-, you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone.|sd
Well you see all that on T V|sd
and I could never be that person.|sd
Huh-uh.|b
It just, uh, I'm just not, -|%
well I'm so, I'm pretty laid back.|sd
Yeah|b
w-, -|%
And, uh, you know, so I don't, I know a lady in a, my church|sd
and, uh, she like does her own bread and does her own stuff|sd
and so when she, um, does food, she really goes all out|sd
and I don't know how she can do it and be calm|sd
Yeah|b
I guess,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Do you work?|qy
No,|nn
I don't.|sd
Do you stay home with kids?|qy
Uh-huh,|ny
yeah.|ny
Yeah.|b
I, I've been working,|sd
we're going to have a baby this summer,|sd
and I'm not going to work anymore.|sd
Oh, how exciting.|ba
Yeah.|b
So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day.|sd
I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up|sd
and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night,|sd
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven.|sd
Yeah.|b
Eat at six, yeah.|b^m
Yeah,|b
and, uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family.|sd
Oh, that's good.|ba
Uh, yeah,|b
I don't like the run in and out part.|sd
Yeah.|b
And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened|sd
and,|sd
Yeah,|b
that's neat.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things|sd
and I think that's good.|sv
Yeah,|aa
that really is.|sv
It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other.|sd
Yeah.|b
I think, -|%
Right now we eat in front of the T V|sd
but since it's just the two of us, it's -|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah|b
Well that happens to us sometimes too.|sd
Yeah.|b
But, uh, sometimes if something, uh, is on that they want to watch I leave it on,|sd
but we eat in the kitchen|sd
and their heads are always poking past the door.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
to see what's happening.|^2
Yeah.|b
Anyway food is, is, uh, a real life-style kind of thing|sv
and i-, some people don't like to do this|sv
but I like to co-, uh, cook with my kids.|sv
Oh, uh-huh.|b
And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help.|sd
And we make real simple things, you know, those, oh, -|sd
I don-, I don't know if you've ever made them, maybe not since you don't have kids yet, but those Jell-O, uh, gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers, I can't think of what they call it.|sd
Oh, I've seen those in the magazines.|sd
Yeah,|b
they're so simple.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
And the kids love to do that.|sd
Uh, finger food is, is a biggie with them.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, and like, now one thing I wish I could find a, a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that|sd
and it's just really hard|sd
and if you have to work with a knife, I don't like that.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, that's, uh, -|%
they like to eat it,|sd
but it's a hard one to have to, to prepare.|sd
Yeah,|b
But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that.|sd
Oh yeah,|b
yeah,|b
we like that.|sd
Yeah.|b
That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too.|sv
Yeah.|b
My son's getting to be a, a real good cook|sd
so, uh, -|%
Oh, neat.|ba
sometimes he fixes me breakfast|sd
Oh, wow, that's great|ba
Yeah,|b
I like it,|sd
I like it a lot.|sd
How old is he?|qw
He's eleven.|sd
Eleven,|b^m
wow,|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
so hi-, -|%
Do you cook breakfa-, like you cook a breakfast every morning|qy
or, -|%
Uh, not every morning, uh,|ng
mostly during the summer it's hit and miss|sd
and,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Um, during the su-, during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and the loo-, they like it all right.|sd
Yeah.|b
And, um, then sometimes we do something,|sd
it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,|sd
we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,|sd
but. -|%
Oh, uh-huh,|b
yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
so, I try to, uh, -|%
and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that.|sd
I used to do them in the microwave,|sd
but they don't like that.|sd
Oh, do they get rubbery,|qy
or, -|%
Um.|%
I've never tried it.|sd
It de-, it depends.|no
If you let them cook too long --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray|sd
and they will be a little harder,|sd
and I don't like that.|sd
Yeah.|b
So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,|sd
but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top.|sd
Oh.|b
And let it steam.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And then, and then stir it up.|sd
Huh.|b
Yeah,|b
an, and that turns out okay.|sd
Yeah.|b
And it's funny 'cause if I turn them out on to a di-, i-, on to like a plate, for them to take what they want, --|sd
Uh-huh.|sd
It's really funny,|sv
it's very deceiving, you know, 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go, uh, I don't like want that,|sd
Yeah|b
and yet if they don't ever see it, th-, then it's like, oh this tastes okay, you know,|sd
so. -|%
Yeah.|b
Anyway. -|%
We had, -|sd
my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash.|sd
Everybody would say we don't like squash, we won't eat squash,|sd
so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there, you know,|sd
Yeah|b
and then we'd go, oh, this is really good.|sd
Hi|fp
you want to start first|ad
Of course.|aa
We are talking about the elderly and,|sd
Right.|b
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
You apparently have somebody there, in one.|qy^d
No,|nn
actually, my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years|sd
and her mother, -|sd
Oh, you are kidding?|qy
No,|nn
she did.|sd
Oh.|b
And then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I will be darned.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses.|sd
Oh, for heaven's sake.|ba
So, I do know something about that.|sd
You are very, very much aware of what goes on.|sv
Absolutely.|aa
That is great.|ba
Actually, the motivation for Grandmother entering the business,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
She was lonely.|sd
Right.|b
And she needed company,|sd
Right.|b
and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies.|sd
I will be darned.|ba
And then, uh, it, it grew into a,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Uh, then they, -|%
Now, see that is a nice attitude to go into.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- and there is no chance of, uh, good companionship or doing anything.|sv
Well, that is not really true, either, uh,|ad
I think that is a stigma and an I,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
You see, those who had bad experiences talk about them.|sd
Uh, right,|b
right.|b
And those who do not may write,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
but they do not talk a whole lot about that.|sd
That is true.|ba
But what I mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Sure.|b
Well now,|ba
Well, that is because they wait until the children make those choices,|sv
Right.|b
Right,|b
right.|b
However, my daughter-in-law also is a nurse in a nursing home.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, she works for one here in Dallas, which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home.|sd
And these, these, -|%
Uh, uh-huh.|b
I love watching these elderly people come, they will come and tell her. "Well I am going for my,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, would yo-, would you, you know, call down and have the van come around and take,|^q
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And they are very active and very enthusiastic|sd
and they have,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
Their dining room looks like, you know, Luby's Cafeteria.|sv
Yeah.|b
That is great.|ba
Or, or one of the lovely cafeterias.|sd
And they have, you know, pink linen napkins for their dinners.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
that sounds great.|ba
Oh, I am certainly very much for a nursing home|sv
and I think when the, the parent gets old enough,|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
It is expensive.|sv
It is costly.|sv
See if they could, could get this idea across though, better than what it is,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Well, now my daddy's mother, uh, lived in a, a retirement village|sd
and she and her sister had side by side duplexes,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
She still had her individuality,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but they were there close|sd
and they did have, uh, you know, the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they have security. -|sd
Uh-huh.|b
No,|b
I am very much in favor, -|sd
I have heard horror stories,|sd
Oh, well you have that with anything.|sd
I know that the elderly can easily be abused,|sd
Oh yeah .|b
but I would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are, they are in,|sd
In the homes, yeah.|^2
Well,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
like when my sister was real bad before she died --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And they were super with her.|sd
Absolutely.|aa
They were, uh,|sd
Well now, my grandmother, -|sd
of course all of my folks lived to be very old --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
She went to the doctor,|sd
she had surgery,|sd
she got the treatments|sd
and during,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
She got better,|sd
she got well,|sd
she got out and went dancing again.|sd
Well, a lot of people do that.|sd
They ,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That is right.|ba
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
I think it is a wonderful interim place,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
and yet it is not, you know, -|sv
you have, -|%
And it can become home to them.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
It,|sv
It certainly is.|ba
It certainly does,|ba
but, you see, we have had excellent experience with that.|sd
And, uh, I, I did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill,|sd
but,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
I might,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Uh, I would not particularly think I would want my kids to say, "well, I think this is what I need for Mom", and,|sd
This is -|%
and, -|%
But, I would like, -|%
There has to be consideration taken on everything.|sv
That is right.|ba
Uh-huh,|aa
uh-huh.|aa
And I think you would shop for a nursing home, just like you would shop for a church,|sv
Yeah.|b
That is right,|ba
you would look into it thoroughly and,|sv
Uh-huh,|b
sure.|b
Uh-huh.|b
When you get to the point where you are in trouble,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
No|b
and you do not have the time to look,|sv
that is what,|sd
That is right.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity.|sv
Absolutely.|ba
I think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they are going to be needing those facilities one day,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Go out to the nursing home, help guide some craft programs, perhaps, work on some music programs, whatever their talents are.|ad
Whatever their talents, yeah.|b^m
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|aa
I have a cousin who is, uh, -|sd
she had a son that was epileptic from birth,|sd
and he did fine,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
they lived on a farm,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but she made arrangements, so that when she was gone,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
That is right.|ba
So he, they, she has made arrangements that when she, she was gone, that he would go into the nursing home.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And he has, I would say, he adjusted very well|sd
and, uh, he, he, he has been there quite a long time.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, he don't know me usually|sd
Yeah.|b
So, he goes wheeling down, uh, the hall to bingo.|sd
Somebody else, is helping him out,|sd
That is right.|ba
Uh.|sv
and, uh, he has adjusted very well.|sd
Uh-huh,|b
oh yes.|aa
Yes.|aa
Routine and,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh|b
Uh, the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over.|sd
I do not think they pay,|sv
uh-huh.|b
To keep them there, uh-huh.|^2
True.|ba
and that is sad, because, I think the health profession is one of the most critical,|sv
Yes.|b
But ,|sv
And, uh, -|%
That is right.|ba
It seems to be a resistance.|sv
Care for the elderly and care for the children,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Right,|b
right.|b
But there seems to be a resistance.|sv
You are preserving your heritage and your future there.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
So, uh, -|%
And, as a matter of fact, I do not see why they do not have children's programs in nursing homes.|sv
Well, around here, we have some, you know, the churches,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
the children thoroughly enjoy, -|sd
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Scott, let's, uh, talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university --|ad
Uh-huh.|b
Do you have any?|qy
-- and, -|%
Do you have any kids|qy
or, -|%
I have some, yes, some children.|sd
I have three boys.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And they're all quite young --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so we want to plan for their education|sd
or we're saving right now|sd
and we're getting bonds, and, and, uh, and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to.|sd
How about yourself?|qo
Do you have any kids?|qy
No,|nn
I'm in, I'm in graduate school right now|sd
So I imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college --|sd
Yeah.|aa
Yeah,|aa
definitely.|aa
In fact, I'm even going, uh, selecting again for, for my P H D.|sd
It's, it's a close subject right now|sd
Very good.|ba
Uh,|%
What, uh, what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to?|qw
Well I use, uh, uh, uh, I have used, uh, several techniques depending on what, -|sd
for undergraduate, I, I, you know, my criteria were much different than --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, when I, when I wanted to go to an undergraduate institution, I was looking for something that was, you know, rather small and easy to get around, you know.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah|b
what you thought, huh.|bf
Yeah|aa
And, and, uh, my choice of graduate schools was, uh, you know, it changed a whole lot.|sd
I, I got to where I, I wanted to, uh, graduate with a little, you know, with a name behind me, rather than, uh -- -|sd
Just the degree itself.|^2
-- yeah,|aa
yeah.|aa
Well, that's a, that's, that's good, because I did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I wanted to get a school that was small enough, that was personable --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
-- and, uh, but you, I felt that I got a pretty good, uh, undergraduate, uh, -|sd
Where, where did you go?|qw
I went to Utah State University --|sd
Okay.|bk
Uh-huh.|b
-- and the nice thing about it too is, I knew that I wanted to get into business and that their business, College of Business, was accredited|sd
and well known --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And so I, I feel like, number one, you ne-, you also need to see what kind of name the, -|sd
like you mentioned before, the name the college and university can, can give you --|sv
Yeah.|b
I wanted to make sure that I would be able to afford it, that I wouldn't get through four, three years of the undergraduate work and, and have to leave.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, so I did a lot of talking with friends, with family --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, it was kind of unusual because my, my two older brothers and I all went to thr-, three different universities, depending on what our choice was.|sd
So. -|%
Right.|b
Hopefully we, we chose the one that was best for us,|sd
and I, I felt very comfortable and good about that.|sd
So. -|%
Uh-huh.|b
Do you, do you worry, do you worry any about, uh, uh, being able, -|qy
I mean, obviously you've taken precautions, you know, or measures to, uh, try and pay for your children's education,|sd
but do you think that that's going to be enough?|qy
I don't think so.|ng
No.|b^m
I don't know.|no
The, the way that tuition is increasing, um, exponentially --|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
I, uh, -|%
I, all I, all I can hope for is that I land a professorship at a nice heavy university.|sd
And that, that your children can use the benefits of --|sv
Yeah|aa
Well, that's an excellent idea,|ba
that's an excellent idea.|ba
One thing that, uh, that we did, uh, and my parents, and our family, is that we weren't able to afford, um, the kind of education that we all desired.|sd
So my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education, because my parents couldn't.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And what the scholarship could not supply I was able to, to work for and --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Also, my, my brother, um, he's a, he's a medical doctor right now.|sd
He had to, you know, -|sd
once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree, he had to take out some loans,|sd
and he's, he's working to pay those off.|sd
Yeah.|b
So I, I think that the, uh, you know, once you get past, uh, the initial stages of it, that there's different options you can use|sv
and, and, uh --|sv
Yeah.|b
Yeah,|b
that's what, that's my biggest option right now.|sd
Yeah|b
Yes,|b
and, and as you're well aware that tuition's not, -|sv
Okay|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
I'll let you go ahead|ad
Okay.|aa
I, uh, I have five children all together.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
Uh, my oldest two are already out and about in the world|sd
and I, uh, have a set of twins that are fourteen --|sd
Oh.|b
-- and, uh, my youngest is twelve.|sd
That's great.|ba
I always thought it'd be great to have twins.|sd
Uh, yeah.|b
If you like doing everything twice|sv
Well, yeah|b
Uh, at any rate, um, my first two children, uh, I didn't spend a whole lot of time with them.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, and, you know, was a, a problem with having five children needing to work a, uh, a full-time job that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, so I didn't get to spend as much time with them as I, as I should have, as I really wanted to.|sd
Your first ones you mean, it,|qy
Yeah.|ny
The, -|%
yeah,|ny
the f-, -|%
well, it was with all of them,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it was, uh, more an impact, I think, on the oldest two.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Because, um, oh, about the time I got out of working that long hours was when the, uh, when the twins were about three years old.|sd
And, uh, they never, you know, I don't think they noticed I wasn't around that much.|sd
Oh.|b
You know, with all the children around the house, it's,|sd
Right.|b
Um, so, what I've tried to do, uh, now that I've, uh, fi-, -|sd
went back to school and got my degree when I was thirty years old.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, so, then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fifty-one hours,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So, I've tried to spend more time with, uh, the children since then.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, what I'm currently doing is, uh, taking a lot of time.|sd
I'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings.|sd
Um, we just started a thing where every other week we go to, uh, movies.|sd
There's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And so, every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, it's working out pretty well.|sd
Um, we're spending more time together.|sd
I feel like I'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than I ever was to the two that were living there before.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Um, in fact, I found that I'm a lot closer with, uh, -|sd
I have one son who's gone|sd
and I don't even know where he's at.|sd
Huh.|b
Um, he's taken off for parts unknown,|sd
That's difficult.|ba
but, uh, yeah.|aa
Yeah.|b
A-, -|%
and, uh, my daughter is, um, has moved out of the house.|sd
Her and I get along a lot better now that she's moved out of the house|sd
Uh-huh|b
It happens that way|sd
And uh, so it's, it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time,|sd
and I think it's important that we do, because, uh, I notice that, uh, when I had spent two years down in Dallas, down there they all have a, uh, a me kind of attitude.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I noticed parents not spending time with their,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, you know, I knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine|sd
and,|%
Um, uh-huh.|b
I saw the family falling apart down,|sd
Texas is,|sv
I mean, it was bad enough every place else,|sv
but drugs is, in Texas, are extremely bad.|sd
Yeah.|b
And so, I think it's kind of important that I, that I, you know, nurture the relationship I have with my children now.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I'm doing my best --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Well, that's all you can do.|sd
Yeah.|b
What's your, been your experience?|qw
Well, I, I was going to ask, too, does your wife work?|qy

Uh, she worked a job until we moved to our new house|sd

Uh-huh.|b
Oh, uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
So, that sounds great.|ba
Well, uh, we also have five children.|sd
Huh.|b
And, but ours are all out of the nest|sd
So, uh, as, when they were growing up, I, probably we had a lot of similar things l-, like you had, you know, having the time.|sd
When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones.|sv
Yeah.|b
But, uh, we were, we're very active, of course, at church, and, uh, Boy Scouting, and Girl Scouts, Four H, uh,|sd
and those activities helped a lot in,|sd

And, uh, you know, he, uh, he worked a full-time job and a part-time job,|sd

Uh-huh.|b
-- now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years,|sv
I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.|sv
Oh, yeah,|b
I would think so, like right after, um, high school --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
course now Peace Corps, that couldn't be done of course, until they were done with school --|sv
Right,|b
right,|b
You know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
but, yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
you know, right, right after you graduate from, um, high school, because a lot of people are just, um, uh, Well gee whiz, what do I do now --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, you know, having that, that, uh, gung ho plan --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Kind of an in-between --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
yeah,|b
so to me, see that would be the, the, uh, the greatest time for, um, you know, teenagers to, to do that, would be right after they graduated from high school.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
But as for its being required --|sv
Yeah.|b
Huh-uh.|b
No,|aa
and like I said, not, now all young people should be able to do something,|sv
but --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I mean --|sv
Right.|b
but --|sv
Oh, right.|b
they're just not made to do that type of thing --|sv
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
-- and they just aren't able to do it.|sv
Yeah,|b
yeah,|b
so, um, yeah,|b
it'd be good|sv
but like I said, requiring it would be, uh, -|sv
Doug, you want to start?|ad
Sure.|aa
You don't use any credit cards, I don't imagine.|qy^d
No.|nn
Of course I use,|sd
I have a couple of credit cards --|sd
Yeah.|b
Uh-huh,|b
do you use them a lot?|qy
Oh, we try not to.|ng
Uh-huh.|b
We're on a pretty strict and tight budget.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We use the credit cards, however, when we're at a situation where we don't have either the cash or the checkbook handy.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Or we use credit cards also, if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we're purchasing.|sd
So.|%
Oh, well, that's an idea,|ba
that's a thought,|ba
uh-huh.|b
and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and so when we're traveling some. -|sd
Do you use credit cards often?|qy
My husband loves them|no
Uh, we do use them.|sd
Uh, we try not to,|sd
but, he, he's one who believes in credit cards,|sd
and he uses them quite a bit.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
He likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month|sd
Oh, yeah,|b
well --|sv
He, he likes that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- and they just pay the minimum required balance.|sd
And that's when you get into expenses.|sv
Yes,|aa
and you get in over your head.|sv
Right.|aa
It'll, uh, -|%
some people I know also try to use it as float --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and say, well, I'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale|sd
and then I can --|^q
Uh-huh.|b
when I'm being paid.|^q
Right.|b
Well, sometimes you do come on bargains and that,|sd
and it's really useful.|sv
That's true.|aa
And some places won't take, you know, like personal checks or cash, even --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
-- but they would take a credit card.|sd
Right.|aa
How a-, how are the laws in Pennsylvania, uh, as, as regard, well not the laws, but the rates, credit card rates in Pennsylvania?|qo
For example down here, when you go up to a gas station --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Are they the same there?|qy
We, -|%
yeah,|ny
we have the same thing up here,|sd
so we don't deal where they do that|sd
We cha-, you know, we go to places where they don't charge extra.|sd
Some of them charge five cents a gallon, even,|sd
like the gas stations more, -|sd
That's pretty steep.|ba
And, uh, we just try to avoid, you know, the ones that do that,|sd
we just don't, uh, go there --|sd
Yes.|b
extra --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
to me they are, anyway,|sd
Yes,|aa
because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase|sd
and, and so that --|qy
Right.|aa
Right,|aa
yeah.|aa
Yes.|aa
Yeah,|ny
right.|na
Very good.|ba
You're, you're one of the good, I guess, good faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money.|sd
Well, I can't say we never have.|sd
Now we have, you know, at times, made payments --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but we try not to.|sd
We try hard,|sd
Well, yeah,|b
well, I see that as an advantage to a credit card, also --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- that you can --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
Right.|b
So I think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
because sometimes, uh, there's times when you may, maybe couldn't take advantage of something --|sv
Uh-huh.|b
-- but with a credit card you can.|sv
So. -|%
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Um, do you have, uh, multiple credit cards?|qy
Uh.|%
And do you find that advantageous|qy
or, -|qy
Well, I think we're narrowing it down, actually.|sd
Uh, uh, like I said, my husband likes them,|sd
and we have quite a few,|sd
but we really get, when you get down to the nitty gritty, there's probably three that we use --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Right.|b
We're, we're actually in the same boat.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
We like to use three, uh, basic credit cards.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
That way we're not confused|sd
and we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And, do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail?|qy
Oh, yes.|ny
Once a week,|sd
twice a week,|sd
or three times a week.|sd
Well, it's not every week,|sd
but you, you do get them.|sd
They make it very readily available.|sd
Yeah.|b
Almost too much so.|sv
But I re-, I really don't like it the charges that, you know, -|sd
we try to limit, look at that also,|sd
what they charge per year --|sd
Right,|b
so the annual fee. -|bf
Right,|b
right,|b
-- they're charging us to spend our money,|sd
and, I, I'm not real crazy about that,|sd
so we try to look at that also.|sd
Yes,|b
so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card --|sd
Uh-huh,|b
Right.|b
Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Miss Nancy, we should be in business now.|sd
Good.|bk
Did you hear the questions that the lady, uh, brought up?|qy
Yes.|ny
Such as how much time, well, -|qy^d
I'll ask,|oo_co_cc
how much time do you spend with your children,|qw
and how many do you have?|qw
We have two children,|sd
they're both grown and married|sd
and with, we have, uh, -|%
our daughter has three sons,|sd
so we see them at least once a week,|sd
and we see our son and his wife uh, about every other week|sd
and, uh --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
So we're a fairly close-knit family.|sd
We're together a lot on special days|sd
and, uh, and of course, with the holidays and everything. -|sd
Well, you're very fortunate.|ba
Uh, my my, uh, -|%
I have two girls and a son,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam, Holland.|sd
Oh.|b
She|sd
so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them, as much as I'd like to.|sd
Oh, yes.|ba
I play in several symphony orchestras|sd
and,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Oh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, her husband builds forte pianos,|sd
which are harpsichord size pianos.|sd
Pianos, uh-huh.|b^m
And, uh, that's why they're over there.|sd
And then I have a, a son who lives in, uh, Warrington, Pennsylvania.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And I get to see him maybe once every three months.|sd
So I really, we've lost, you know, -|sd
I'd like to have an everyday contact with children, uh, as well as you do, for that matter,|sd
and my young , my youngest daughter lives in New Jersey,|sd
and so they,|sd
Oh, you don't get to see any of yours very often.|bf
She works in these, um, Trump type casinos,|sd
she and her husband both do.|sd
They work, --|sd
Yes,|b
uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
-- and, uh, they're running lights right now and audio and that thing for,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But anyhow uh,|%
what do you, what activities do you do with your children when you are together?|qw
Oh, most the time, -|%
well, right now it's football season,|sd
and our daughter is a big Cowboy fan,|sd
as is our husband,|sd
so, my husband, -|%
so she watches that|sd
and I play with the grandchildren|sd
I enjoy the grandchildren.|sd
But, now, like last weekend, um, there's the Soviet space exhibit is here in Dallas,|sd
and it ends,|sd
Oh.|b
so she and, and the three boys and my husband and I went over into Fort Worth to see the space exhibit|sd
and this Sunday, -|%
The Soviet space exhibit?|qy
Uh-huh.|ny
My goodness.|ba
Yeah|aa
I am surprised they would bring anything over here.|sv
I think it came here in either September or October|sd
and,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I'll bet.|ba
and it's been very well done|sv
Uh, and this, uh, next Sunday they're coming over after the Cowboy game|sd
and, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, then when our son's over, we have a pool,|sd
and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends,|sd
and we have cookouts on Sunday uh,|sd
Well, that sounds like you have really, --|ba
And, uh --|sd
and we --|sd
Yeah.|b
We've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger.|sd
Uh, we're very family oriented.|sd
We, um,|sd
and the kids seem to enjoy being with us,|sd
and their friends enjoy being with us.|sd
So which that keeps us very, very young, with all these young people passing in and out and eating,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and seems like I've, -|%
The only problem is, it keeps you pretty busy, keeping everything going,|sv
doesn't it?|^g
Well, it does|na
I'm worried about Christmas.|sd
Christmas Eve they all pass through,|sd
and then they all end up spending the night Christmas Eve night, so that,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Beautiful.|ba
-- and they go out to the other, you know, the in-laws in between some of this,|sd
but they're all,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, uh, then have Christmas dinner with us and then go to other in-laws and things,|sd
so we see a lot of them.|sd
But we enjoy Christmas Eve night, because they all start arriving by about eleven o'clock,|sd
and we open presents about five o'clock Christmas,|sd
and, you know, and, uh, then,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and my sister and, and her husband are coming down,|sd
so there's going to be eleven of us for Christmas.|sd
That's great.|ba
There's a, -|%
the question now to ask, is it difficult to find time,|sd
and you seem to be making out all right.|sv
Yeah.|aa
Sometimes I'm a little exhausted|sd
Well, tell me,|ad
wh-, what do you think of, uh, of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth?|qo
Oh, I, I think the trends are going back to spending more time with families.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
I think parents are definitely, uh, spending more and more time.|sv
I don't think they're leaving them with baby-sitters, you know.|sv
I think, I think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there --|sv
Yes.|b
Uh-huh.|b
Seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal.|sv
Parents kind of went and did their thing,|sv
kids did their thing.|sv
Well, that's -|%
no,|aa
that's exactly what I was going to say.|aa
Of, of course, I find now that I spend more time with my grandchildren in --|sd
uh-huh.|b
I know more about them and watch their growth and how they improve and, and learn much more so than my own kids.|sd
When, when your own children are growing up, you just take them for granted|sv
and you go ahead and do your thing|sv
and, -|%
All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc
Well, she lives in Utah,|sd
so. -|%
Oh, uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
That's the way we always were.|sd
We always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up.|sd
Yeah.|b
So, well, I guess we're going to talk about children today.|ad
Okay,|aa
let's do i-,|ad
So, you ready?|qy
My children are all gone already.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
They're, they're all out on their own.|sd
So, uh, do you want to start first|ad
yo-, yo-,|qy
Okay.|aa
No,|nn
I don't,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
I stay home most of the time|sd
but I know that it's very difficult to, to find good help sometimes when and especially when your, when you want your children to be taken care of.|sd
Right.|b
Um, you know, there's a, -|%
my neighbor she tends children though|sd
and, and, um, there's a big controversy whether they should have to, um, have a, a l-, a law to have them certified or, or not.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, um, you know, there's pros and cons on both side of that --|sv
Right.|b
-- because if they were, then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah,|b
but yet most of the problems we hear, -|sd
of course, maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers.|sv
That's right.|aa
That's right.|aa
But maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be.|sv
Yeah.|b
You know, the individual incidence or something.|sv
Uh-huh.|b
Uh, now, usually when I have someone tend, um, -|sd
my oldest tends for me now if I go somewhere|sd
but, -|%
Uh-huh,|b
how old,|qw
before, -|%
He's almost a teenager|sd
Oh, well, he's plenty big enough then|sv
Yeah,|aa
he's, he's very good.|sd
Um, but, um, before that I would, I would use, uh, kids from our church,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they did a good job,|sd
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
Um, but I've never had to leave them like in a day care center,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I've been very lucky just be able to stay home.|sd
That's the way with me.|aa
I, I worked four years one time,|sd
but my last two children were, uh, both entering high school age.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, they were, of course, gone while I was w-, working|sd
so it wasn't a problem I saw,|sd
and I stayed home the rest of the time.|sd
Yeah.|b
I, so I didn't have that problem either.|sd
Now I have, I, -|%
my oldest daughter she has two children|sd
and they've been in day care, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
she works full time.|sd
Yeah,|b
that's hard.|bf
It, it's difficult|sd
but yet she's the type of person that, I don't know, if she'd be happy staying at home.|sd
Well, some people aren't.|ba
Uh-huh.|b
Yeah.|b
She, she surprised me though.|sd
She's done a lot of things that I never thought she would do, you know, with, with the family because she was m-, the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children.|sd
Oh, is that, is that right?|bh
So, she is, she spends a lot of quality time I think when she is with, with the children.|sd
I think that's really important.|ba
And, uh, sh-, they've used the day care most of the time.|sd
They tried one once.|sd
They had a lady come in.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
And, uh, she, she also had a small child she brought with her.|sd
And it did not work out. Uh, at all|sd
Uh-huh.|b
It, she thought it was going to.|sd
She was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out,|sd
Yeah,|aa
uh-huh.|b
but, uh, I-, th-, the lady called|sd
and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble.|sd
And this baby is the, is the most pleasant, uh, real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually.|sd
And, and she was having problems with her,|sd
and so she called and said things were okay, settled down and was all right.|sd
Yeah,|b
yeah.|b
Well, my daughter decided to call them and check|sd
and things weren't okay|sd
Oh.|ba
Her, her one son was watching the soapies|sd
which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies.|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
And the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out,|sd
Oh, dear.|ba
and the baby-sitter was in the kitchen with her baby.|sd
Oh.|ba
And so that ended that,|sd
Yeah.|ba
and she was most upset, uh, over finding this.|sd
Yeah,|b
I bet.|ba
So, uh, she, they kind of had decided that the day care was better.|sd
There's, uh,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
more than one adult they, -|sd
and the age groups are separated|sd
Well, nannies have been an option, uh,|sd
but I know that at day care they have more of a, a routine like at-, maybe in, uh,|sd
Yes,|b
story time, uh,|^2
Uh-huh.|b
and the, this one has been particularly nice.|sd
It, uh, it kept track of what they did,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and they would tell the parents what they did that day.|sd
You know, if they said anything or did anything.|sd
So it kind of ac-, i-, kept them, -|sd
Gave you an idea of what your child,|bf
Yeah.|aa
I oft-, I always thought that if you were checking into a day care, that you would be good to get references,|sv
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|aa
Yeah.|aa
Because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying, you know,|sv
if there was a problem they, they would I think be more ready to tell you what it was.|sv
Oh, I think so, because if they were still there, you know they might not,|sv
They may not say anything.|sv
Right,|aa
right.|aa
And, uh, other than how else, how do you judge other than from what others have, uh, what you see, uh, the cleanliness and that type of thing.|sv
You can't really.|aa
You can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something,|sv
Uh-huh.|b
and usually they aren't at that age.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
But it would be real difficult to pick you, you know, to find one and --|sv
Well, I know I, uh, about three years ago I, I tended some children.|sd
Uh-huh.|b
or whether they'd just bring them|sd
and --|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and so,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh,|b
uh-huh.|b
And then if there was a problem|sd
and then we'd sit down,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
but it never happened,|sd
Yeah.|b
Yeah.|b
and, and so things worked out okay,|sd
and their kids played with my kids|sd
and it worked out well.|sd
I-, it worked out good.|bf
I'm going to, I've decided I'm going to baby-sit my two granddaughters.|sd
Oh.|b
Since they'll be going back at the end of the month.|sd
And so,|sd
That's great.|ba
I, I, I sell Avon and Stanley products,|sd
Oh, uh-huh.|b
and I've got that worked out.|sd
My husband, he's retired|sd
so he's going to deliver my products|sd
so I'll do my orders and that by phone.|sd
Well, that will be great.|ba
So, um,|sd
Yeah.|b
But I th-,|sv
Yeah.|b
I bet you'll have some great experiences with them.|sv
Yeah,|aa
I, I think I'll enjoy. -|sv
Yeah.|aa
I, I guess I kind of miss having a baby around|sd
Sure,|ba
why not.|bh
Yeah.|aa
Right.|aa
That's right|aa
Well, they do say you enjoy them more,|sv
a some, somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun, they would have had them first|sd
Well, uh, my husband's mother lives right over here,|sd
and she takes care of them sometimes,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and, and just is a lovely lady,|sd
Uh-huh.|b
and I've always appreciated when she's sat with them.|sd
Yeah.|b
My daughter,|sd
And, -|%
Oh|b
Uh-huh.|b
Uh-huh.|b
But they're, the ones that complain a lot are the first -|sv
