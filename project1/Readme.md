This project consisted of three parts

1. Speech to text
2. Dialog act classification
3. Generate output

The speech_recognition library is used for speech to text and needs to be installed prior to use

The probabilistic dialog act classifier developed by [this project](https://github.com/NathanDuran/Probabilistic-RNN-DA-Classifier) is used to predict the dialog act
This requires the tensorflow library

The [embedding file](/embeddings/word2vec_swda_300dim.txt) was split because file size is too big for GitHub browser.
Remember to unzip it before using.
